a full system simulator provides virtual hardware that is independent of the nature of the host computer the full system model typically includes processor cores peripheral devices memories interconnection buses and network connections emulators are full system simulators that imitate obsolete hardware instead of under development hardware the defining property of full system simulation compared to an instruction set simulator is that the model allows real device drivers and operating systems to be run not just single programs thus full system simulation makes it possible to simulate individual computers and networked computer nodes with all their software from network device drivers to operating systems network stacks middleware servers and application programs full system simulation can speed the system development process by making it easier to detect recreate and repair flaws the use of multi core processors is driving the need for full system simulation because it can be extremely difficult and time consuming to recreate and debug errors without the controlled environment provided by virtual hardware this also allows the software development to take place before the hardware is ready thus helping to validate design decisions a cycle accurate simulator is a computer program that simulates a microarchitecture on a

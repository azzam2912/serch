the most discussed proposal was a bus rapid transit corridor project running from the maplewood mall to the mall of america through the saint paul union depot in downtown saint paul the route would have used some sections of the central corridor and hiawatha line and run along the center of west 7th street the project was canceled when the minnesota legislature took back the majority of unspent allocated funds concerns about the project included low ridership predictions and neighborhood opposition to the needed right of way expansion it would have been possible that this line could have connected both the blue line and green line making a transit way triangle bus service along the route was later improved although not to the proposed bus rapid transit project levels this corridor of the canceled projects had and continues to have the most consideration the city council of saint paul voted on january 23 2013 to request the ramsey county regional rail authority to conduct a new study of this transit corridor the dan patch corridor was a future commuter rail line it was to run from minneapolis to northfield along the tracks of the former minneapolis northfield and southern railway

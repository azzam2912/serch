this results in a temporary shift of the auditory threshold known as a temporary threshold shift tts the damage can become permanent permanent threshold shift pts if sufficient recovery time is not allowed before continued sound exposure when the hearing loss is rooted from a traumatic occurrence it may be classified as noise induced hearing loss or nihl there are two main types of auditory fatigue short term and long term these are distinguished from each other by several characteristics listed individually below short term fatigue long term fatigue note the complete anatomy of the human ear is extensive and can be divided into the inner ear and outer ear the remainder of this article mainly references the cochlea outer hair cells and organ of corti in general structural damages to any anatomical part of the human ear can cause hearing related problems usually minor bending of the stereocilia of the inner ear is associated with temporary hearing loss and is involved in auditory fatigue complete loss of the stereocilia causes permanent hearing damage and is more associated with noise induced hearing loss and other auditory diseases the outer hair cells or ohcs can be thought of as microamplifiers that

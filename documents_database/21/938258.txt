pgd2 pge2 pgf2alpha prostacyclin pgi2 thromboxane a2 txa2 and pgh2 they are named based on the prostanoid to which they preferentially bind and respond e g the receptor responsive to pgi2 at lower concentrations than any other prostanoid is named the prostacyclin receptor ip one exception to this rule is the receptor for thromboxane a2 tp which binds and responds to pgh2 and txa2 equally well all of the prostanoid receptors are g protein coupled receptors belonging to the subfamily a14 of the rhodopsin like receptor family except for the prostaglandin dp2 receptor which is more closely related in amino acid sequence and functionality to chemotactic factor receptors such as the receptors for c5a and leukotriene b4 prostanoid receptors bind and respond principally to metabolites of the straight chain polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa arachidonic acid these metabolites contain two double bonds and are named series 2 prostanoids i e pgd2 pge2 pgf2 pgi2 txa2 and pgh2 however the same enzymes that metabolize arachidonic acid to series 2 prostanoids similarly metabolize two other straight chain pufas they metabolize gamma linolenic acid which has one less double bond than arachidonic acid to series 1 prostanoids pgd1 pge1 etc which have one less

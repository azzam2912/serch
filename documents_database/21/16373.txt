a drop may form when liquid accumulates at the lower end of a tube or other surface boundary producing a hanging drop called a pendant drop drops may also be formed by the condensation of a vapor or by atomization of a larger mass of liquid liquid forms drops because the liquid exhibits surface tension a simple way to form a drop is to allow liquid to flow slowly from the lower end of a vertical tube of small diameter the surface tension of the liquid causes the liquid to hang from the tube forming a pendant when the drop exceeds a certain size it is no longer stable and detaches itself the falling liquid is also a drop held together by surface tension some substances that appear to be solid can be shown to instead be extremely viscous liquids because they form drops and display droplet behavior in the famous pitch drop experiments pitch a substance somewhat like solid bitumen is shown to be a liquid in this way pitch in a funnel slowly forms droplets each droplet taking about 10 years to form and break off in the pendant drop test a drop of liquid is suspended from

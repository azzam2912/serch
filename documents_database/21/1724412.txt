tyrrhenian amphorae were only produced during a short period about 565 to 550 bc they are ovoid in shape and bear striking decorations the handle is usually decorated with a lotus palmette cross or vegetal tendrils it always terminates in a red painted ridge the vase body is painted with several friezes the uppermost of these on the shoulder is usually especially notable it often contains mythological scenes but the first erotic motifs in attic vase painting also occur here unique motifs include the sacrifice of polyxene often the figures are explained by added inscriptions the other friezes usually two to three in number are often decorated with animals at times a frieze is replaced with a vegetal band the animal friezes and use of colour resemble corinthian vase painting it is likely that the attic vase painters copied corinthian examples so as to improve their products attractivity on the etruscan markets thus the athenian producers entered direct competition with the then market leader corinth by producing features popular in etruria such as neck amphorae and colourful decoration corinth only produced few nack amphora thus the athenians apparently deliberately served a niche market the etruscans themselves also produced similar vases

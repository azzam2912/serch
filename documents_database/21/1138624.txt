specifically with respect to a fixed circle with center and radius the inverse of a point is the point for which lies on the ray and the inverse of the curve is then the locus of as runs over the point in this construction is called the center of inversion the circle the circle of inversion and the radius of inversion an inversion applied twice is the identity transformation so the inverse of an inverse curve with respect to the same circle is the original curve points on the circle of inversion are fixed by the inversion so its inverse is itself the inverse of the point with respect to the unit circle is where or equivalently so the inverse of the curve determined by with respect to the unit circle is it is clear from this that inverting an algebraic curve of degree with respect to a circle produces an algebraic curve of degree at most similarly the inverse of the curve defined parametrically by the equations with respect to the unit circle is given parametrically as this implies that the circular inverse of a rational curve is also rational more generally the inverse of the curve determined by

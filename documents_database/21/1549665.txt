the concept was proved to be successful in flight testing however no further development of the system or aircraft was proceeded with and at the conclusion of its test program the do 29 was retired during the second world war heinrich focke of focke achgelis a manufacturer of helicopters developed a design for a short takeoff and landing aircraft that would utilise a system of pusher propellers one on each wing in a pusher configuration to provide downward thrust and enhance lift designated fa 269 the design was not developed due to the state of the war in the 1950s however a renewed interest in stol and vtol aircraft led to a re evaluation of focke s concept and dornier was given a contract to develop an aircraft capable of demonstrating the tilting propeller system the aircraft given the designation do 29 was based on the do 27 light transport modified with twin lycoming go 480 engines mounted below the wings these engines drove three bladed pusher propellers that were capable of being tilted downwards to an angle of up to 90 degrees and the engines were coupled so that symmetrical thrust could be maintained in the event of an

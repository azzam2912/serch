the simplest formulation is a set x x d where d which can be called the study region is a subset of r a n dimensional euclidean space the easiest way to visualize a 2 d point pattern is a map of the locations which is simply a scatterplot but with the provision that the axes are equally scaled if d is not the boundary of the map then it should also be indicated an empirical definition of d would be the convex hull of the points or at least their bounding box a matrix of the ranges of the coordinates another straightforward way to visualize the points is a 2d histogram sometimes called a quadrats that bins the points into rectangular regions a benefit of quadrat analysis is that it forces the analysis to take into account possible scales within which statistically significant inhomogeneities may be occurring the null model for point patterns is complete spatial randomness csr modeled as a poisson process in r which implies that the number of points in any arbitrary region a in d will be proportional to the area or volume of a exploring models is generally iterative if csr is accepted not

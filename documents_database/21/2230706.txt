hilgers in 1992 that use forces to distalize the upper 1st molars to create space for eruption of impacted teeth or allowing correction of class 2 malocclusion this appliance is a fixed type of distalizing appliance that does not depend on the compliance of each patient to work hilgers published an article in journal of clinical orthodontics in 1992 describing the appliance the initial design of the appliance used the occlusal rests which were bonded to the premolars for retention however premolars can also be banded for the retention purposes pre activation of the appliance mandates bending of the tma springs 90 degrees or parallel to the midline of the palate then once the appliance is in the mouth the springs are inserted into the lingual sheaths of the molar bands to allow the force distally and medially the patient then presents every 3 weeks for the re adjustment of the springs as the molar moves distally forces of the spring cause the molar to move in an arc towards the middle of the palate therefore this can lead to crossbite in the posterior teeth in order to avoid this side effect the adjustment loops are opened to counteract this

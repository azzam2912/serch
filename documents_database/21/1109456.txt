the bcm model proposes a sliding threshold for long term potentiation ltp or long term depression ltd induction and states that synaptic plasticity is stabilized by a dynamic adaptation of the time averaged postsynaptic activity according to the bcm model when a pre synaptic neuron fires the post synaptic neurons will tend to undergo ltp if it is in a high activity state e g is firing at high frequency and or has high internal calcium concentrations or ltd if it is in a lower activity state e g firing in low frequency low internal calcium concentrations this theory is often used to explain how cortical neurons can undergo both ltp or ltd depending on different conditioning stimulus protocols applied to pre synaptic neurons usually high frequency stimulation or hfs for ltp or low frequency stimulation lfs for ltd in 1949 donald hebb proposed a working mechanism for memory and computational adaption in the brain now called hebbian learning or the maxim that cells that fire together wire together this law formed the basis of the brain as the modern neural network theoretically capable of turing complete computational complexity and thus became a standard materialist model for the mind however

cdcp1 has also been designated as cd318 cluster of differentiation 318 and trask transmembrane and associated with src kinases alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported cdcp1 trask is not important for the development of the mouse adult mice lacking cdcp1 do not exhibit gross morphologic reproductive or behavioral abnormalities compared with wild type mice and histologic examination of multiple organ systems has shown no significant pathology and no observed histologic differences cdcp1 is a ligand for cd6 a receptor molecule expressed on certain t cells and may play a role in their migration and chemotaxis as such cdcp1 may contribute to autoimmune diseases such as encephalomyelitis multiple sclerosis and inflammatory arthritis cdcp1 is a 140 kd transmembrane glycoprotein with a large extracellular domain ecd containing two cub domains and a smaller intracellular domain icd cdcp1 is cleaved by serine proteases at the extracellular domain next to arg368 to generate a truncated molecule of 80 kda size different cell lines express different amounts of p140 and p80 depending on the activity of endogenous serine proteases in vivo cdcp1 is not cleaved during normal physiological circumstances but its cleavage can be induced during tumorigenesis or tissue injury the

in computer science real time scheduling analysis is the evaluation testing and verification of the scheduling system and the algorithms used in real time operations for critical operations a real time system must be tested and verified for performance in computer science testing and verification is also known as model checking a real time scheduling system is composed of the scheduler clock and the processing hardware elements in a real time system a process or task has schedulability tasks are accepted by a real time system and completed as specified by the task deadline depending on the characteristic of the scheduling algorithm modeling and evaluation of a real time scheduling system concern is on the analysis of the algorithm capability to meet a process deadline a deadline is defined as the time required for a task to be processed for example in a real time scheduling algorithm a deadline could be set to five nano seconds in a critical operation the task must be processed in the time specified by the deadline i e five nano seconds a task in a real time system must be completed neither too early nor too late a system is said to be unschedulable

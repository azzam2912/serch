he studied mating systems in filamentous heterotrophs beginning with the aquatic genus achlya once thought to be fungi because of their filamentous growth form and nutritional habits achlya and other water molds are now known to belong to the kingdom chromalveolata red and carlene cardy later studied the genetic control of sexual reproduction in the gilled mushroom schizophyllum commune red realized early on there were fungi that differed in aspects of compatibility and attributed these to what he called incompatibility factors a and b further differentiating and in each some fungi have two mating types termed bipolar and others including some red worked on have thousands of mating types due to a more complicated mating type determination system these two extreme strategies are thought to be involved with manipulating the chance of out versus self crossing as evolutionary strategies he and cardy studied the events preceding karyogamy including the transition from monokaryotic to dikaryotic much of red s work has spawned many research questions about sex in fungi addressed more recently using model organisms like saccharomyces cerevisiae cryptococcus gattii and candida albicans his research laid the foundation for the current knowledge body about somatic and sexual compatibility in fungi through

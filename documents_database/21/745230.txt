it is further measured experimentally in confirmation or specification of a theory see experimental particle physics for example at low energies the interaction of a photon with a nucleon is a very complicated calculation involving interactions between the photon and a sea of quarks and gluons and often the calculation cannot be fully performed from first principles often in this context form factors are also called structure functions since they can be used to describe the structure of the nucleon however the generic lorentz invariant form of the matrix element for the electromagnetic current interaction is known where formula 2 represents the photon momentum equal in magnitude to e c where e is the energy of the photon the three functions formula 3 are associated to the electric and magnetic form factors for this interaction and are routinely measured experimentally these three effective vertices can then be used to check or perform calculations that would otherwise be too difficult to perform from first principles this matrix element then serves to determine the transition amplitude involved in the scattering interaction or the respective particle decay cf fermi s golden rule in general the fourier transforms of form factor components correspond to

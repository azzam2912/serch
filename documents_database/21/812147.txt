the resulting entity is a polytopal subdivision of the facet in formula 2 that together with the original facet is combinatorially equivalent to the original polytope the diagram is named for victor schlegel who in 1886 introduced this tool for studying combinatorial and topological properties of polytopes in dimensions 3 and 4 a schlegel diagram is a projection of a polyhedron into a plane figure and a projection of a 4 polytope to 3 space respectively as such schlegel diagrams are commonly used as a means of visualizing four dimensional polytopes the most elementary schlegel diagram that of a polyhedron was described by duncan sommerville as follows sommerville also considers the case of a simplex in four dimensions the schlegel diagram of simplex in s is a tetrahedron divided into four tetrahedra more generally a polytope in n dimensions has a schegel diagram constructed by a perspective projection viewed from a point outside of the polytope above the center of a facet all vertices and edges of the polytope are projected onto a hyperplane of that facet if the polytope is convex a point near the facet will exist which maps the facet outside and all other facets inside so

a debye sphere is a volume whose radius is the debye length with each debye length charges are increasingly electrically screened every debye length formula 1 the electric potential will decrease in magnitude by 1 e debye length is an important parameter in plasma physics electrolytes and colloids dlvo theory the corresponding debye screening wave vector formula 2 for particles of density formula 3 charge formula 4 at a temperature formula 5 is given by formula 6 in gaussian units expressions in mks units will be given below the analogous quantities at very low temperatures formula 7 are known as the thomas fermi length and the thomas fermi wave vector they are of interest in describing the behaviour of electrons in metals at room temperature the debye length arises naturally in the thermodynamic description of large systems of mobile charges in a system of formula 8 different species of charges the formula 9 th species carries charge formula 10 and has concentration formula 11 at position formula 12 according to the so called primitive model these charges are distributed in a continuous medium that is characterized only by its relative static permittivity formula 13 this distribution of charges within this

the word dinosaur itself coined in 1842 by paleontologist richard owen comes from the greek for fearsome lizard this view began to shift during the so called dinosaur renaissance in scientific research in the late 1960s and by the mid 1990s significant evidence had emerged that dinosaurs were much more closely related to birds which descended directly from the theropod group of dinosaurs and are themselves a subgroup within the dinosauria knowledge of the origin of feathers developed as new fossils were discovered throughout the 2000s and 2010s and as technology enabled scientists to study fossils more closely among non avian dinosaurs feathers or feather like integument have been discovered in dozens of genera via direct and indirect fossil evidence although the vast majority of feather discoveries have been in coelurosaurian theropods feather like integument has also been discovered in at least three ornithischians suggesting that feathers may have been present on the last common ancestor of the ornithoscelida a dinosaur group including both theropods and ornithischians it is possible that feathers first developed in even earlier archosaurs in light of the discovery of highly feather like pycnofibers in pterosaurs crocodilians also possess beta keratin similar to those of birds

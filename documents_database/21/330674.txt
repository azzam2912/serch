this contradicts with the expectations derived from the corresponding linear system for infinitesimal amplitudes which tends towards an even distribution of initially localized energy a discrete breather is a breather solution on a nonlinear lattice the term breather originates from the characteristic that most breathers are localized in space and oscillate breathe in time but also the opposite situation oscillations in space and localized in time is denoted as a breather a breather is a localized periodic solution of either continuous media equations or discrete lattice equations the exactly solvable sine gordon equation and the focusing nonlinear schr dinger equation are examples of one dimensional partial differential equations that possess breather solutions discrete nonlinear hamiltonian lattices in many cases support breather solutions breathers are solitonic structures there are two types of breathers standing or traveling ones standing breathers correspond to localized solutions whose amplitude vary in time they are sometimes called oscillons a necessary condition for the existence of breathers in discrete lattices is that the breather main frequency and all its multipliers are located outside of the phonon spectrum of the lattice the sine gordon equation is the nonlinear dispersive partial differential equation with the field u a function

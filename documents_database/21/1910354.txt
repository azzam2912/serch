however the kpi driven code analysis does not only analyze the source code other information sources such as coding activities are also included to create a comprehensive impression of the quality and development progress of a software system kpi driven code analysis is a fully automated process which thus enables team activities and modifications to the overall source code of a software system to be monitored in real time in this way negative trends become evident as soon as they arise this early warning system thus offers a powerful instrument for reducing costs and increasing development speed through the early warning approach of kpi driven code analysis every newly introduced level of complexity is discovered in good time and its impact can thus be minimized instead of wasting valuable time trying to reduce legacy complexities developers can use their time for new functionality helping the team increase productivity the human factor is included in the kpi driven code analysis which means that it also looks at which code was registered by which developer and when in this way the quality of software delivered by each individual developer can be determined and any problems in employee qualification direction and motivation can

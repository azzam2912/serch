the oven walls are coated with heat and acid resistant porcelain enamel a self cleaning oven is designed to stay locked until the high temperature process is completed a mechanical interlock is used to keep the oven door locked and closed during and immediately after the high temperature cleaning cycle which lasts approximately three hours to prevent possible burn injuries usually the door can be opened after the temperature cools to approximately self cleaning ovens usually have more insulation than standard ovens to reduce the possibility of fire the insulation also reduces the amount of energy needed for normal cooking self cleaning ovens are considered more convenient and time saving and therefore more cost effective however because of the high temperatures of burning they produce smoke and odors in some cases this may set off a smoke alarm according to most professionals this can be avoided by regular usage of the self cleaning program catalytic continuous clean ovens rely on high metal porous enamels to catalyze the reduction of soils to ash at normal cooking temperatures the walls of catalytic self cleaning ovens are coated with materials acting as oxidation catalysts usually in the form of catalyst particles in a

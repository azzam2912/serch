these systems are based on specific characteristics like shape of organs or nature of reproduction differently in landslide classification there are great difficulties because phenomena are not perfectly repeatable usually being characterised by different causes movements and morphology and involving genetically different material for this reason landslide classifications are based on different discriminating factors sometimes very subjective in the following write up factors are discussed by dividing them into two groups the first one is made up of the criteria utilised in the most widespread classification systems that can generally be easily determined the second one is formed by those factors that have been utilised in some classifications and can be useful in descriptions this is the most important criterion even if uncertainties and difficulties can arise in the identification of movements being the mechanisms of some landslides often particularly complex the main movements are falls slides and flows but usually topples lateral spreading and complex movements are added to these rock earth and debris are the terms generally used to distinguish the materials involved in the landslide process for example the distinction between earth and debris is usually made by comparing the percentage of coarse grain size fractions if

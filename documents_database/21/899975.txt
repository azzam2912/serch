a graph which admits a graceful labeling is called a graceful graph the name graceful labeling is due to solomon w golomb this class of labelings was originally given the name labelings by alexander rosa in a 1967 paper on graph labelings a major unproven conjecture in graph theory is the graceful tree conjecture or ringel kotzig conjecture named after gerhard ringel and anton kotzig which hypothesizes that all trees are graceful the ringel kotzig conjecture is also known as the graceful labeling conjecture kotzig once called the effort to prove the conjecture a disease another weaker version of graceful labelling is the near graceful labeling in which the vertices can be labeled using some subset of the integers between 0 and m 1 inclusive such that no two vertices share a label and each edge is uniquely identified by the absolute difference between its endpoints such that this magnitude lies between 1 and m 1 inclusive another conjecture in graph theory is the rosa s conjecture named after alexander rosa which says that all triangular cacti are graceful or nearly graceful

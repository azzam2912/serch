crps include a highly conserved secretion peptide signal at the n terminus and a cysteine rich region at the c terminus crps are numerous in plants with 756 crp encoding genes in the arabidopsis thaliana genome several crps bind known receptors but most crp signaling mechanisms and protein interactions are uncharacterized characterized crps function as short range intercellular signals during processes such as plant defense bacterial symbiosis stomatal patterning fertilization vegetative tissue development and seed development many crps function in plant defense defensins a major class of crp with an eight cysteine motif forming four disulfide bridges are involved in pathogen response other putative antimicrobial crps include lipid transfer proteins thionins knottins heveins and snakins additionally some crps have allergenic amylase inhibitory or protease inhibitory functions that deter herbivores in plant reproduction crps are involved in pollen tube growth and guidance and early embryo patterning in addition to other functions among those involved in pollen tube attraction are the lures a group of ovular pollen tube attractants in arabidopsis thaliana and torenia fournieri that preferentially attract conspecific pollen and stig1 a crp expressed in the stigma of solanum lycopersicum that interacts with the pollen specific receptor prk2 in early embryo

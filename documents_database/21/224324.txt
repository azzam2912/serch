it is a colorless liquid with a somewhat unpleasant odor it is soluble in water and organic solvents isobutyric acid is an isomer of n butyric acid deprotonation or esterification of isobutyric acid gives derivatives called isobutyrates isobutyric acid is found in the free state in carobs ceratonia siliqua in vanilla and in the root of arnica dulcis and as an ethyl ester in croton oil isobutyric acid is prepared by the oxidation of isobutyraldehyde which is a byproduct of the hydroformylation of propylene it can also be prepared by the high pressure hydrocarboxylation koch reaction from propylene many routes are known including the hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile with alkalis and the oxidation of isobutanol with potassium dichromate in the presence of sulfuric acid in the presence of proton donors the action of sodium amalgam on methacrylic acid also gives isobutyric acid isobutyric acid can also be manufactured commercially using engineered bacteria using a sugar feedstock when heated with a chromic acid solution it is oxidized to acetone alkaline potassium permanganate oxidizes it to hydroxyisobutyric acid ch c oh coh isobutyric acid is a retained trivial name under the iupac rules

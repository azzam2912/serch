the earth s mantle is composed of ultramafic rocks ultrabasic is a more inclusive term that includes igneous rocks with low silica content that may not be extremely enriched in fe and mg such as carbonatites and ultrapotassic igneous rocks intrusive ultramafic rocks are often found in large layered ultramafic intrusions where differentiated rock types often occur in layers such cumulate rock types do not represent the chemistry of the magma from which they crystallized the ultramafic intrusives include the dunites peridotites and pyroxenites other rare varieties include troctolite which has a greater percentage of calcic plagioclase these grade into the anorthosites gabbro and norite often occur in the upper portions of the layered ultramafic sequences hornblendite and rarely phlogopite are also found volcanic ultramafic rocks are rare outside of the archaean and are essentially restricted to the neoproterozoic or earlier although some boninite lavas currently erupted within back arc basins manus trough new guinea verge on being ultramafic subvolcanic ultramafic rocks and dykes persist longer but are also rare there is evidence of ultramafic rocks elsewhere in the solar system examples include komatiite and picritic basalt komatiites can be host to ore deposits of nickel ultramafic tuff is extremely

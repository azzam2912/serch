it is defined as the depth at which the intensity of the radiation inside the material falls to 1 e about 37 of its original value at or more properly just beneath the surface when electromagnetic radiation is incident on the surface of a material it may be partly reflected from that surface and there will be a field containing energy transmitted into the material this electromagnetic field interacts with the atoms and electrons inside the material depending on the nature of the material the electromagnetic field might travel very far into the material or may die out very quickly for a given material penetration depth will generally be a function of wavelength according to beer lambert law the intensity of an electromagnetic wave inside a material falls off exponentially from the surface as if formula 2 denotes the penetration depth we have penetration depth is one term that describes the decay of electromagnetic waves inside of a material the above definition refers to the depth formula 4 at which the intensity or power of the field decays to 1 e of its surface value in many contexts one is concentrating on the field quantities themselves the electric and magnetic

at least a portion of the cave must have a temperature below 0 c 32 f all year round and water must have traveled into the cave s cold zone this type of cave was first formally described by englishman edwin swift balch in 1900 who suggested the french term glacieres should be used for them even though the term ice cave was then as now commonly used to refer to caves simply containing year round ice among speleologists ice cave is the proper english term a cavity formed within ice as in a glacier is properly called a glacier cave ice caves occur as static ice caves such as durmitor ice cave and dynamic or cyclical ice caves such as eisriesenwelt in most of the world bedrock caves are thermally insulated from the surface and so commonly assume a near constant temperature approximating the annual average temperature at the surface in some cold environments such as that surrounding mount erebus average surface and thus cave temperatures are below freezing and with surface water available in summer ice caves are possible and are sometimes overlain by fumarolic ice towers however many ice caves exist in temperate climates due to mechanisms

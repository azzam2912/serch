while impurities of the alloy are the primary cause of the problem environmental conditions such as high humidity greater than 65 may accelerate the process it was first discovered to be a problem in 1923 and primarily affects die cast zinc articles that were manufactured during the 1930s 1940s and 1950s the new jersey zinc company developed zamak alloys in 1929 using 99 99 pure zinc metal to avoid the problem and articles made after 1960 are usually considered free of the risk of zinc pest since the use of purer materials and more controlled manufacturing conditions make zinc pest degradation unlikely affected objects may show surface irregularities such as small cracks and fractures blisters or pitting over time the material slowly expands cracking buckling and warping in an irreversible process that makes the object exceedingly brittle and prone to fracture and can eventually shatter the object destroying it altogether due to the expansion process attached normal material may also be damaged the occurrence and severity of zinc pest in articles made of susceptible zinc alloys depends both on the concentration of lead impurities in the metal and on the storage conditions of the article in the ensuing decades zinc

the particles may be visible to the naked eye usually must be larger than one micrometer and will eventually settle although the mixture is only classified as a suspension when and while the particles have not settled out a suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but get suspended throughout the bulk of the solvent left floating around freely in the medium the internal phase solid is dispersed throughout the external phase fluid through mechanical agitation with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents an example of a suspension would be sand in water the suspended particles are visible under a microscope and will settle over time if left undisturbed this distinguishes a suspension from a colloid in which the suspended particles are smaller and do not settle colloids and suspensions are different from solution in which the dissolved substance solute does not exist as a solid and solvent and solute are homogeneously mixed a suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called an aerosol in the atmosphere the suspended particles are called particulates and consist of fine dust and soot particles sea salt biogenic and volcanogenic sulfates

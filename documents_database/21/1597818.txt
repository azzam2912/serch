based on a set of compiler directives standard is a programming model designed to handle hardware accelerators without the complexity associated with gpu programming this approach based on directives has been implemented because they enable a loose relationship between an application code and the use of a hardware accelerator hwa the openhmpp directive based programming model offers a syntax to offload computations on hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to from the hardware memory the model is based on works initialized by caps compiler and architecture for embedded and superscalar processors a common project from inria cnrs the university of rennes 1 and the insa of rennes openhmpp is based on the concept of codelets functions that can be remotely executed on hwas a codelet has the following properties these properties ensure that a codelet rpc can be remotely executed by a hwa this rpc and its associated data transfers can be asynchronous hmpp provides synchronous and asynchronous rpc implementation of asynchronous operation is hardware dependent hmpp considers two address spaces the host processor one and the hwa memory the openhmpp directives may be seen as meta information added in the application source code they are safe meta information

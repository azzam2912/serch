it operates on analog signals whose amplitude varies continuously an example is a bucket brigade device other types of delay line include acoustic usually ultrasonic magnetostrictive and surface acoustic wave devices a series of resistor capacitor circuits rc circuits can be cascaded to form a delay a long transmission line can also provide a delay element the delay time of an analog delay line may be only a few nanoseconds or several milliseconds limited by the practical size of the physical medium used to delay the signal and the propagation speed of impulses in the medium analog delay lines are applied in many types of signal processing circuits for example the pal television standard uses an analog delay line to store an entire video scanline acoustic and electromechanical delay lines are used to provide a reverberation effect in musical instrument amplifiers or to simulate an echo high speed oscilloscopes used an analog delay line to allow observation of waveforms just before some triggering event with the growing use of digital signal processing techniques digital forms of delay are practical and eliminate some of the problems with dissipation and noise in analog systems inductor capacitor ladder networks were used as analog

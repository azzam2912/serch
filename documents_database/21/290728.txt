fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity to power the motor generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen most fuel cell vehicles are classified as zero emissions vehicles that emit only water and heat as compared with internal combustion vehicles hydrogen vehicles centralize pollutants at the site of the hydrogen production where hydrogen is typically derived from reformed natural gas transporting and storing hydrogen may also create pollutants fuel cells have been used in various kinds of vehicles including forklifts especially in indoor applications where their clean emissions are important to air quality and in space applications the first commercially produced hydrogen fuel cell automobile the hyundai tucson fcev was introduced in 2013 toyota mirai followed in 2015 and then honda entered the market fuel cells are also being developed and tested in trucks buses boats motorcycles and bicycles among other kinds of vehicles as of 2017 there was limited hydrogen infrastructure with 36 hydrogen fueling stations for automobiles publicly available in the u s but more hydrogen stations are planned particularly in california some public hydrogen fueling stations exist and new stations are being planned in japan europe and elsewhere critics doubt whether hydrogen will be efficient or

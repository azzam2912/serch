the formation of these networks is context dependent and can be influenced by factors such as soil fertility resource availability host or myco symbiont genotype disturbance and seasonal variation due to enrichment of nitrogen in soil affect michozial communities or effect of human activities of human affecting nitrogen cycle by analogy to the many roles intermediated by the world wide web in human communities the many roles that mycorrhizal networks appear to play in woodland have earned them a colloquial nickname the wood wide web several studies have demonstrated that mycorrhizal networks can transport carbon phosphorus nitrogen water defense compounds and allelochemicals from plant to plant the flux of nutrients and water through hyphal networks has been proposed to be driven by a source sink model where plants growing under conditions of relatively high resource availability e g high light or high nitrogen environments transfer carbon or nutrients to plants located in less favorable conditions a common example is the transfer of carbon from plants with leaves located in high light conditions in the forest canopy to plants located in the shaded understory where light availability limits photosynthesis there are two main types of mycorrhizal networks arbuscular mycorrhizal networks and

the origin of its name is not known it may be named after the mythical hercules or after an unknown woman of that name the bulk of the asteroids discovered by wolf around this date were named for characters in operas but if this name was also drawn from such a source no explanation has been recorded herculina is one of the larger members of the main asteroid belt it is believed to rank among the top 20 in size but the exact dimensions of many large asteroids are still uncertain the current estimate for its mass would rank it close to the top 10 it has often been noted for its complex lightcurves which made determination of its shape and rotation somewhat difficult a set of 1982 speckle interferometry observations led to a simple preliminary model of herculina as a three axis object perhaps 260 by 220 by 215 km 1985 analysis of this data concluded there was a nonspherical shape with one bright spot whilst a 1987 photometric astrometry study concluded the object was spherical with two dark spots and rotated around a completely different pole which was in turn negated by a 1988 thermal study which showed

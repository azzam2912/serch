it is a nonstoichiometric variant of fes the mineral known as troilite pyrrhotite is also called magnetic pyrite because the color is similar to pyrite and it is weakly magnetic the magnetism decreases as the iron content increases and troilite is non magnetic pyrrhotite exist as a number of polytypes of hexagonal or monoclinic crystal symmetry several polytypes often occur within the same specimen their structure is based on the nias unit cell as such fe occupies an octahedral site and the sulfide centers occupy trigonal prismatic sites materials with the nias structure often are non stoichiometric because they lack up to 1 8th fraction of the metal ions creating vacancies one of such structures is pyrrhotite 4c fes here 4 indicates that iron vacancies define a superlattice that is 4 times larger than the unit cell in the c direction the c direction is conventionally chosen parallel to the main symmetry axis of the crystal this direction usually corresponds to the largest lattice spacing other polytypes include pyrrhotite 5c fes 6c fes 7c fes and 11c fes every polytype can have monoclinic m or hexagonal h symmetry and therefore some sources label them for example not as 6c but

a mars lander would carry a set of exolance penetrators each weighing a few kilograms the penetrators would separate as the lander spacecraft enters the martian atmosphere passively falling to the martian surface the penetrators would make use of technology originally developed for bunker buster munitions which are designed to burrow under the surface before exploding in this case the explosive payload would be replaced by a scientific one specifically a metabolic test that would attempt to detect chemical reactions created by any active microorganisms living one to two meters below the surface the rear end of the penetrator would remain on the surface connected to the buried probe by a cable to provide a communications link to orbiting satellites having multiple probes allows for individual probe failures without losing the entire mission the goal is to create something that is both small enough and affordable enough to be able to be put on several planned flights aerojet rocketdyne is performing computer modeling of the mars penetrators as a design tool a company called exolife inc has patented the improved deep penetrator designed to carry life detection equipment and has licensed critical self sterilizing coating technology for the penetrators exolife

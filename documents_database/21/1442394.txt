for example in base 3 ternary there are three 1 12 and 22 the term munchausen number was coined by dutch mathematician and software engineer daan van berkel in 2009 as this evokes the story of baron munchausen raising himself up by his own ponytail because each digit is raised to the power of itself let formula 2 be a natural number we define the perfect digit to digit invariant function for base formula 3 formula 4 to be the following where formula 6 is the number of digits in the number in base formula 1 and is the value of each digit of the number as 0 is usually undefined there are typically two conventions used one where it is taken to be equal to one and another where it is taken to be equal to zero a natural number formula 2 is a perfect digit to digit invariant if it is a fixed point for formula 10 which occurs if formula 11 for the first convention formula 12 is a fixed point for all formula 1 and thus is a trivial perfect digit to digit invariant for all formula 1 and all other perfect digit to digit invariants

base excision repair is the mechanism by which damaged bases in dna are removed and replaced dna glycosylases catalyze the first step of this process they remove the damaged nitrogenous base while leaving the sugar phosphate backbone intact creating an apurinic apyrimidinic site commonly referred to as an ap site this is accomplished by flipping the damaged base out of the double helix followed by cleavage of the n glycosidic bond glycosylases were first discovered in bacteria and have since been found in all kingdoms of life in addition to their role in base excision repair dna glycosylase enzymes have been implicated in the repression of gene silencing in a thaliana n tabacum and other plants by active demethylation 5 methylcytosine residues are excised and replaced with unmethylated cytosines allowing access to the chromatin structure of the enzymes and proteins necessary for transcription and subsequent translation there are two main classes of glycosylases monofunctional and bifunctional monofunctional glycosylases have only glycosylase activity whereas bifunctional glycosylases also possess ap lyase activity that permits them to cut the phosphodiester bond of dna creating a single strand break without the need for an ap endonuclease elimination of an ap site by a glycosylase

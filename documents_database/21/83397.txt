according to the etymologiae by isidore of seville tabula was first invented by a greek soldier of the trojan war named alea in the epigram zeno who was white red in illustration had a stack of seven checkers three stacks of two checkers and two blots checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2 5 and 6 as in backgammon zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opponent black pieces the white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results as required by the game rules was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for zeno tabula was most likely a later refinement of ludus duodecim scriptorum with the board s middle row of points removed and only the two outer rows remaining today the word is still used to refer to backgammon in greece as well as in syria and turkey as tavla

its purpose is to implement the detailed testing of complex and important software software pseudocode or code is tested to assess the proper handling of all decision outcomes as with multiple condition coverage and basis path testing coverage of all independent isolated condition paths is accomplished through modified condition decision coverage mc dc isolated conditions are aggregated into connected situations creating test cases the independence of a condition is shown by changing the condition value in isolation each relevant condition value is covered by test cases a test case consists of a logical path from start to end of a process through one or many decisions contradictory situations are deduced from the test case matrix and excluded the mc dc approach isolates every condition neglecting all possible subpath combinations and path coverage where the decision formula 2 consists of a combination of elementary conditions formula 3 formula 4 formula 5 formula 6 the transition function formula 7 is defined as formula 8 given the transition formula 9 formula 10 formula 11 formula 12 formula 13 the isolated test path formula 14 consists of formula 15 formula 16 a test case graph illustrates all the necessary independent paths test cases to

the robot is controlled by an industry standard pc system which is powerful enough to plan routes for fully autonomous driving via a wlan link robotino can send all sensor readings to an external pc in the other direction control commands can be issued by the external pc this way control programs can run on the external pc or on robotino directly mixed mode or shared control are also possible for users with little prior robotics knowledge robotino can be readily programmed in its native programming environment robotinoview ii more experienced programmers may find it useful that the robot can also be programmed in c c java net matlab simulink labview and microsoft robotics developer studio the omnidirectional drive consists of three mecanum wheels all of which are individually controllable these wheels are arranged at angles of 120 robotino has a bumper sensor around its circumference infrared distance sensors a color camera with vga resolution optical wheel encoders power measurement for the entire system and the various motors as well as a battery voltage monitor moreover as optional additional sensors robotino can be equipped with a precise laser scanner a gyroscope and an indoor positioning system created by evolution robotics

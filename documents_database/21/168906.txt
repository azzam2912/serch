ventilation facilitates respiration respiration refers to the utilization of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide by the body as a whole or by individual cells in cellular respiration the most important function of breathing is the supplying of oxygen to the body and the removal of its waste product of carbon dioxide under most conditions the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 or concentration of carbon dioxide controls the respiratory rate the peripheral chemoreceptors that detect changes in the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide are located in the arterial aortic bodies and the carotid bodies central chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to changes in the ph in the blood resulting from changes in the levels of carbon dioxide and they are located on the medulla oblongata near to the medullar respiratory groups of the respiratory center information from the peripheral chemoreceptors is conveyed along nerves to the respiratory groups of the respiratory center there are four respiratory groups two in the medulla and two in the pons the two groups in the pons are known as the pontine respiratory group from the respiratory center the muscles of respiration in particular the diaphragm are activated to cause air to move in

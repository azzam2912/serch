it consists of a collection of particles called superpartners corresponding to operators in a quantum field theory which in superspace are represented by superfields superfields were introduced by abdus salam and j a strathdee in their 1974 article supergauge transformations operations on superfields and a partial classification were presented a few months later by sergio ferrara julius wess and bruno zumino in supergauge multiplets and superfields the most commonly used supermultiplets are vector multiplets chiral multiplets in 4d n 1 supersymmetry for example hypermultiplets in 4d n 2 supersymmetry for example tensor multiplets and gravity multiplets the highest component of a vector multiplet is a gauge boson the highest component of a chiral or hypermultiplet is a spinor the highest component of a gravity multiplet is a graviton the names are defined so as to be invariant under dimensional reduction although the organization of the fields as representations of the lorentz group changes note however that the use of these names for the different multiplets can vary in literature sometimes a chiral multiplet whose highest component is a spinor can be referred to as a scalar multiplet also in n 2 susy a vector multiplet whose highest component is a

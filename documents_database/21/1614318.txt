m bicornis has several unusual morphological characteristics namely the two postcloacal horns in the posterior of males and a separate elongated cephalic region head that may be extended and retracted these features differ vastly from other cosmocercoidean nematodes as well as any others within the family kathlaniidae and as such necessitate the creation of the new genus myleusnema however no genetic taxonomic studies have been performed the generic name derives from the greek terms myleus generic name of fish host and nema short for nematode whereas the specific name bicornis refers to the two postcloacal horns present on males myleusnema bicornis possess characteristics which are common for all nematodes they are long and cylindrical with a worm like shape show bilateral symmetry and contain a pseudocoelom a primitive body cavity only longitudinal muscles are present within nematodes which are covered by a protective cuticle layer nerve chords relay stimuli from sensory organs such as amphids phasmids cephalic papillae and caudal papillae m bicornis differs from other nematodes in that it possess an extended oesophageal cavity a ventral pre anal sucker and an unusual number of caudal papillae 12 total 1 lone the cephalic extremity is also made up of three

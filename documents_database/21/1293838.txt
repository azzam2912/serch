it occurs in vascular plants that commonly have roots in both wet and dry soils especially plants with both taproots that grow vertically down to the water table and lateral roots that sit close to the surface then in the late 1980s there was a movement to understand the full extent of these subterranean networks since then it was found that vascular plants are assisted by fungal networks which grow on the root system to promote water redistribution hot dry periods when the surface soil dries out to the extent that the lateral roots exude whatever water they contain will result in the death of such lateral roots unless the water is replaced similarly under extremely wet conditions when lateral roots are inundated by flood waters oxygen deprivation will also lead to root peril in plants that exhibit hydraulic redistribution there are xylem pathways from the taproots to the laterals such that the absence or abundance of water at the laterals creates a pressure potential analogous to that of transpirational pull in drought conditions ground water is drawn up through the taproot to the laterals and exuded into the surface soil replenishing that which was lost under flooding conditions plant

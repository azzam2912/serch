they are holomorphic on at all the nonpositive integers these polygamma functions have a pole of order the function is sometimes called the trigamma function when and the polygamma function equals this expresses the polygamma function as the laplace transform of formula 4 it follows from bernstein s theorem on monotone functions that for and real and non negative formula 5 is a completely monotone function setting in the above formula does not give an integral representation of the digamma function the digamma function has an integral representation due to gauss which is similar to the case above but which has an extra term formula 6 it satisfies the recurrence relation which considered for positive integer argument leads to a presentation of the sum of reciprocals of the powers of the natural numbers and for all like the log gamma function the polygamma functions can be generalized from the domain uniquely to positive real numbers only due to their recurrence relation and one given function value say except in the case where the additional condition of strict monotonicity on is still needed this is a trivial consequence of the bohr mollerup theorem for the gamma function where strictly logarithmic convexity

light production in these single celled organisms is produced by small structures in the cytoplasm called scintillons among bioluminescent organisms only dinoflagellates have scintillons in the dinoflagellates the biochemical reaction that produces light involves a luciferase catalysed oxidation of a linear tetrapyrrole called luciferin the dinoflagellate lingulodinium polyedra previously called gonyaulax polyedra also contains a second protein called luciferin binding protein lbp that has been proposed to protect luciferin from non luminescent oxidation luciferin is released from lbp by a decrease in ph and the same decreased ph also activates the luciferase light production in the dinoflagellates occurs in bioluminescent organelles called scintillons and can be stimulated by agitation of the surrounding seawater the name scintillon was first used to describe cytoplasmic particles isolated from a bioluminescent species of dinoflagellate that were able to produce a flash of light in response to a decrease in ph scintillons were first observed in l polyedra by fluorescence microscopy where they appear as small blue dots close to the cell surface this blue fluorescence is due to the presence of the bioluminescence reaction substrate a naturally fluorescent molecule called luciferin when light production is stimulated by addition of dilute acid to the cells

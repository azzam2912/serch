its members are physiologically diverse and ubiquitous especially in soils but are under represented in culture members of this phylum are physiologically diverse and can be found in a variety of environments including soil hot springs oceans caves and metal contaminated soils the members of this phylum are particularly abundant in soil habitats representing up to 52 of the total bacterial community environmental factors such as ph and nutrients have been seen to drive acidobacteria dynamics many acidobacteria are acidophilic including the first described member of the phylum acidobacterium capsulatum other notable species are holophaga foetida geothrix fermentans acanthopleuribacter pedis and bryobacter aggregatus since they have only recently been discovered and the large majority have not been cultured the ecology and metabolism of these bacteria is not well understood however these bacteria may be an important contributor to ecosystems since they are particularly abundant within soils members of subdivisions 1 4 and 6 are found to be particularly abundant in soils as well as their natural soil habitat unclassified subdivision 2 acidobacteria have also been identified as a contaminant of dna extraction kit reagents which may lead to their erroneous appearance in microbiota or metagenomic datasets members of subdivision 1

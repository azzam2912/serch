research on harvestman phylogeny that is the phylogenetic tree is in a state of flux while some families are clearly monophyletic that is share a common ancestor others are not and the relationships between families are often not well understood the relationship of harvestmen with other arachnid orders is still not sufficiently resolved up until the 1980s they were thought to be closely related to mites acari in 1990 shultz proposed grouping them with scorpions pseudoscorpions and solifugae camel spiders he named this clade dromopoda this view is currently widely accepted however the relationships of the orders within dromopoda are not yet sufficiently resolved when only considering recent taxa the harvestmen appear as a sister group to novogenuata scorpions pseudoscorpions solifugae when also considering fossils the harvestmen are sister to haplocnemata pseudoscorpions and solifugae recent analyses have also recovered the opiliones as sister group to the extinct phalangiotarbids although this has low support in 1796 pierre andr latreille erected the family phalangida for the then known harvestmen but included the genus galeodes solifugae tord tamerlan teodor thorell 1892 recognized the suborders palpatores laniatores cyphophthalmi called anepignathi but also included the ricinulei as a harvestman suborder the latter were removed from

the payload is an elemental particle of a heavy metal coated with the molecule of interest typically plasmid dna this technique is often referred to as biolistics this device is able to transform almost any type of cell including plants and is not limited to transformation of the nucleus it can also transform organelles including plastids and mitochondria the gene gun was originally a crosman air pistol modified to fire dense tungsten particles it was invented by john c sanford ed wolf and nelson allen at cornell university and ted klein of dupont between 1983 and 1986 the original target was onions chosen for their large cell size and the device was used to deliver particles coated with a marker gene which would relay a signal if proper insertion of the dna transcript occurred genetic transformation was the demonstrated upon observed expression of the marker gene within onion cells the earliest custom manufactured gene guns fabricated by nelson allen used a 22 caliber nail gun cartridge to propel a polyethylene cylinder bullet down a 22 caliber douglas barrel a droplet of the tungsten powder coated with genetic material was placed onto the bullet and shot down into a petri dish

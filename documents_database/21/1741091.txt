in formula 1 means algorithm clusters are formed in the way that each cluster is close to one point which is a formula 9 flat formula 1 formula 2 flats algorithm gives better clustering result than formula 1 means algorithm for some data set given a set formula 13 of formula 14 observations formula 15 where each observation formula 16 is an n dimensional real vector formula 1 formula 2 flats algorithm aims to partition formula 3 observation points by generating formula 1 formula 2 flats that minimize the sum of the squares of distances of each observation to a nearest q flat a formula 2 flat is a subset of formula 23 that is congruent to formula 24 for example a formula 9 flat is a point a formula 26 flat is a line a formula 27 flat is a plane a formula 28 flat is a hyperplane formula 2 flat can be characterized by the solution set of a linear system of equations formula 30 where formula 31 formula 32 denote a partition of formula 33 as formula 34 the problem can be formulated as formula 35 where formula 36 is the projection of formula 37 onto formula

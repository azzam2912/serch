it can occur after damage to the central nervous system such as spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury low blood pressure occurs due to decreased systemic vascular resistance as a result of lacking sympathetic tone which in turn causes pools of blood staying within the extremities and not being redirected to the core body the slowed heart rate results from unopposed vagal tone activity and has been found to be exacerbated by hypoxia and neurogenic shock can be a potentially devastating complication leading to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly recognized and treated it is not to be confused with spinal shock which is not circulatory in nature neurogenic shock can result from severe central nervous system damage brain injury cervical or high thoracic spinal cord in more simple terms the trauma causes a sudden loss of background sympathetic stimulation to the blood vessels this causes them to relax vasodilation resulting in a sudden decrease in blood pressure secondary to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance neurogenic shock results from damage to the spinal cord above the level of the 6th thoracic vertebra it is found in about half of people who suffer spinal cord injury within the

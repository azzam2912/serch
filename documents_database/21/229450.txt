water frames in general have existed since ancient egypt times richard arkwright who patented the technology in 1769 designed a model for the production of cotton thread this was first used in 1765 the arkwright water frame was able to spin 128 threads at a time which was an easier and faster method than ever before the design was partly based on a spinning machine built for thomas highs by clock maker john kay who was hired by arkwright being run on water power it produced stronger and harder yarn than the then famous spinning jenny and propelled the adoption of the modern factory system another water powered frame for the production of textiles was developed in 1760 in the early industrialised town of elberfeld prussia now in wuppertal germany by german bleach plant owner johann heinrich bockm hl the water frame is derived from the use of a water wheel to drive a number of spinning frames the water wheel provided more power to the spinning frame than human operators reducing the amount of human labor needed and increasing the spindle count dramatically however unlike the spinning jenny the water frame could spin only one thread at a time

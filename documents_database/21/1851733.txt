the term postglacial typically refers to processes and events that occur after the departure of glacial ice or glacial climates climate change is the main force behind changes in species distribution and abundance repeated changes in climate throughout the quaternary period are thought to have had a significant impact on the current vegetative species diversity present today functional and phylogenetic diversity are considered to be closely related to changing climatic conditions this indicates that trait differences are extremely important in long term responses to climate change during the transition from the last glaciation of the pleistocene to the holocene period climate warming resulted in the expansion of taller plants and larger seed bearing plants which resulted in lower proportions of vegetative regeneration hence low temperatures can be strong environmental filters that prevent tall and large seeded plants from establishing in postglacial environments throughout europe vegetation dynamics within the first half of the holocene appear to have been influenced mainly by climate and the reorganization of atmospheric circulation associated with the disappearance of the north american ice sheet this is evident in the rapid increase of forestation and changing biomes during the postglacial period between 11500ka and 8000ka before the present

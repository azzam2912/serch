acyl coa s are susceptible beta oxidation forming ultimately acetyl coa the acetyl coa enters the citric acid cycle eventually forming several equivalents of atp in this way fats are converted to atp the universal biochemical energy carrier the oxidative degradation of fatty acids is a two step process catalyzed by acyl coa synthetase first the fatty acid reacts with atp to form an acyl phosphate this intermediate reacts subsequently to give acyl coa fatty acids are activated in the cytosol but oxidation occurs in the mitochondria because there is no transport protein for coa adducts acyl groups must enter the mitochondria via a shuttle system involving the small molecule carnitine acyl coa is made by an enzyme called acyl coa synthase there are three different types of acyl coa synthases which can help make 3 different lengths of acyl coa for example medium chain acyl coa synthase is made to work upon 4 11 carbon fatty acids to make 4 11 carbon acyl coa a different type of acyl coa synthase is used for a 11 20 carbon fatty acid to make it into a 11 20 acyl coa the reaction to make acyl coa is also thermodynamically favored

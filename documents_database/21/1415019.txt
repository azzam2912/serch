it is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters in which excess nutrients usually nitrogen or phosphorus stimulate algal growth sources of nutrient pollution include surface runoff from farm fields and pastures discharges from septic tanks and feedlots and emissions from combustion excess nutrients have been summarized as potentially leading to in a 2011 united states environmental protection agency epa report the agency s science advisory board succinctly stated excess reactive nitrogen compounds in the environment are associated with many large scale environmental concerns including eutrophication of surface waters toxic algae blooms hypoxia acid rain nitrogen saturation in forests and global warming use of synthetic fertilizers burning of fossil fuels and agricultural animal production especially concentrated animal feeding operations cafo have added large quantities of reactive nitrogen to the biosphere phosphorus pollution is caused by excessive use of fertilizers and manure particularly when compounded by soil erosion phosphorus is also discharged by municipal sewage treatment plants and some industries the principal source s of nutrient pollution in an individual watershed depend on the prevailing land uses the sources may be point sources nonpoint sources or both nutrient pollution from some air pollution sources may occur independently of the local

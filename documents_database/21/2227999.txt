bathymetric measurements are conducted with various methods from sonar and lidar techniques to buoys and satellite altimetry various methods have advantages and disadvantages and the specific method used depends upon the scale of the area under study financial means desired measurement accuracy and additional variables despite modern computer based research the ocean seabed in many locations is less measured than the topography of mars at the beginning of the twentieth century mapping the seafloor was a very difficult task the mapping of the sea floor started by using sound waves contoured into isobaths and early bathymetric charts of shelf topography these provided the first insight into seafloor morphology though mistakes were made due to horizontal positional accuracy and imprecise depths in 1957 marie tharp working alongside with bruce charles heezen created the first three dimensional physiographic map of the world s ocean basins tharp s discovery was made at the perfect time it was one of many discoveries that took place near the same time as the invention of the computer computers with their ability to compute large quantities of data have made research much easier include the research of the world s oceans there has been a boom in

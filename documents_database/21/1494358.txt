upon translation the nata binds to the ribosome and then stretches to the front end of the forming or nascent polypeptide where it adds this acetyl group this acetyl group is added to the front end or n terminus of the new protein forty percent of all proteins in the yeast proteome are thought to be n terminally acetylated with a corresponding figure of 90 in mammalian proteins to be specific nata is the main n alpha terminal acetyltransferase in the yeast cytosol responsible for the acetylation of proteins at locations in which serine alanine threonine or glycine are present nata acetyltransferase is not a single protein but a complex of three subunits in saccharomyces cerevisiae nata acetyltransferase interacts with the sup35p protein it is involved in the reaction of the psi converting the psi to its own conformation thus psi strains deficient in nata acetyltransferase have been found to have an altered interaction between sup35p psi and nascent sup35p this interaction at the post translational level still produces a prion with classical beta sheets but this version of the interaction does not take away the function of this third release factor thus stop codons are translated reliably in psi

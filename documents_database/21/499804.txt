the m234 mounts on the muzzle bayonet lug and front sight post of the m16 it fires either the m734 64 mm kinetic riot control or the m742 64 mm csi riot control ring airfoil projectiles the latter produces a 4 to 5 foot tear gas cloud on impact the launcher is capable of firing from 4 to 6 projectiles per minute the velocity is sufficiently high to prevent dodging by target individuals at effective ranges the effective range of the projectile is 40 meters on an individual and 60 meters on groups of individuals with a maximum range of 100 meters the main advantage to using ring airfoil projectiles is that their design does not allow them be thrown back by rioters with any real effect the m234 is no longer used by united states forces it has been replaced by the m203 40mm grenade launcher and nonlethal ammunition the ring airfoil projectile rap is designed as an incapacitant the original design used kinetic and tear gas projectiles for use in the m234 riot control launcher the design of the rap is an aerodynamic circular tubed shaped munition that discharges tear gas on impact and or uses blunt force

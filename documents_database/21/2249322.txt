the specific mutation in hemoglobin hopkins 2 results in two abnormal chains human hemoglobin consist of 2 and 2 polypeptides usually termed chains the mutation is the result of histidine 112 being replaced with aspartic acid in the protein s polypeptide sequence additionally within one of the mutated alpha chains there are substitutes at 114 and 118 two points on the amino acid chain this mutation can cause sickle cell anemia following the initial discovery of hemoglobin two researchers working at johns hopkins hospital in the mid twentieth century ernest w smith and j v torbert discovered the hopkins 2 mutation of hemoglobin work by harvey a itano and elizabeth a robinson in 1960 confirmed smith s and torbert s finding and emphasized the importance of the alpha loci in the mutation later in the twentieth century samuel charache another hopkins affiliated scientist and doctor studied the physiological impacts of the variant on health his findings suggest that the variant plays no effect clinically in the mid 1900s many factors prompted hemoglobin research in baltimore maryland and ultimately led to the discovery of hemoglobin hopkins 2 first the development of new technology including x ray crystallography and protein chemistry that

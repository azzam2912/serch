the connector uses a bayonet mount similar to those of the bnc and mhv connectors but is easily distinguished due to its very thick and protruding insulator this insulation geometry makes shv connectors safer for handling high voltage than mhv connectors by preventing accidental contact with the live conductor in an unmated connector or plug the connector is also designed such that when it is being disconnected from a plug the high voltage contact is broken before the ground contact to prevent accidental shocks the connector is also designed to prevent users from forcing a high voltage connector into a low voltage plug or vice versa as can happen with mhv and bnc connectors by reversing the gender compared to bnc details of the connector comprising dimensions of the mating parts voltage rating minimum insulation requirements and more are specified by the iec document 60498 shv connectors are used in laboratory settings for voltages and currents beyond the capacity of bnc and mhv connectors standard shv connectors are rated for 5000 volts dc and 5 amperes although higher voltage versions to 20 kv are also available shv connectors are not as common as the older mhv type a common usage

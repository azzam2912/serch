it is a dynamic table that maps mac addresses to ports it is the essential mechanism that separates network switches from ethernet hubs content addressable memory cam is typically used to efficiently implement the fib thus it is sometimes called a cam table at the data link layer a fib is most notably used to facilitate ethernet bridging based on mac addresses other data link layer technologies using fibs include frame relay asynchronous transfer mode atm and multiprotocol label switching mpls the role of an ethernet switch is to forward ethernet frames from one port to another the presence of a fib is one attribute that separates a switch from a hub without a functional fib all frames received by a network switch would be echoed back out to all other ports much like an ethernet hub in bridging packets between ports a switch should only emit a frame on the port where the destination network device resides unicast unless the frame is for all nodes on the switch broadcast multiple nodes multicast or if the switch doesn t know where the destination device resides unicast flood switches learn the port on which they first saw a particular source address

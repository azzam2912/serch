the prime objective of hete was to carry out the first multiwavelength study of gamma ray bursts with uv x ray and gamma ray instruments mounted on a single compact spacecraft a unique feature of the hete mission was its capability to localize grbs with 10 arc second accuracy in near real time aboard the spacecraft and to transmit these positions directly to a network of receivers at existing ground based observatories enabling rapid sensitive follow up studies in the radio ir and optical bands the satellite bus for the first hete 1 was designed and built by aeroastro inc of herndon va the replacement satellite hete 2 was built by mit based on the original hete design the first hete was lost during the launch on november 4 1996 the pegasus rocket achieved a good orbit but explosive bolts releasing hete from another satellite argentina s sac b and from its dpaf dual payload attach fitting envelope failed to charge dooming both satellites a battery on the third stage of the rocket and responsible for these bolts cracked during the ascent a second hete satellite hete 2 was launched on october 9 2000 in a follow up mission it

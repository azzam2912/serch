in the context of software architecture data flow relates to stream processing or reactive programming dataflow is a software paradigm based on the idea of disconnecting computational actors into stages pipelines that can execute concurrently dataflow can also be called stream processing or reactive programming there have been multiple data flow stream processing languages of various forms see stream processing data flow hardware see dataflow architecture is an alternative to the classic von neumann architecture the most obvious example of data flow programming is the subset known as reactive programming with spreadsheets as a user enters new values they are instantly transmitted to the next logical actor or formula for calculation distributed data flows have also been proposed as a programming abstraction that captures the dynamics of distributed multi protocols the data centric perspective characteristic of data flow programming promotes high level functional specifications and simplifies formal reasoning about system components hardware architectures for dataflow was a major topic in computer architecture research in the 1970s and early 1980s jack dennis of mit pioneered the field of static dataflow architectures designs that use conventional memory addresses as data dependency tags are called static dataflow machines these machines did not allow

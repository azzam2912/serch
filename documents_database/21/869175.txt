igfbp 3 the most abundant protein accounts for 80 of all igf binding igf 1 binds to igfbp 3 in a 1 1 molar ratio igf bp also binds to igf 1 inside the liver allowing growth hormone to continuously act upon the liver to produce more igf 1 igf binding proteins igfbps are proteins of 24 to 45 kda all six igfbps share 50 homology with each other and have binding affinities for igf i and igf ii at the same order of magnitude as the ligands have for the igf ir the igfbps help to lengthen the half life of circulating igfs in all tissues including the prostate individual igfbps may act to enhance or attenuate igf signaling depending on their physiological context i e cell type even with these similarities some characteristics are different chromosomal location heparin binding domains rgd recognition site preference for binding igf i or igf ii and glycosylation and phosphorylation differences these structural differences can have a tremendous impact on how the igfbps interact with cellular basement membranes in humans igfbps are transcribed from the following seven genes

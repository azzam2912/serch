rnap locally opens the double stranded dna usually about four turns of the double helix so that one strand of the exposed nucleotides can be used as a template for the synthesis of rna a process called transcription a transcription factor and its associated transcription mediator complex must be attached to a dna binding site called a promoter region before rnap can initiate the dna unwinding at that position rnap not only initiates rna transcription it also guides the nucleotides into position facilitates attachment and elongation has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities and termination recognition capability in eukaryotes rnap can build chains as long as 2 4 million nucleotides rnap produces rna that functionally is either coding for protein messenger rna mrna or non coding so called rna genes at least four functional types of rna genes exist rna polymerase is essential to life and is found in all living organisms and many viruses depending on the organism a rna polymerase can be a protein complex multi subunit rnap or only consist of one subunit single subunit snap sssnap each representing an independent lineage the former is found in bacteria archaea and eukaryotes alike sharing a similar core structure and

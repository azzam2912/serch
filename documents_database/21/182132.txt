before karyogamy each haploid cell has one complete copy of the organism s genome in order for karyogamy to occur the cell membrane and cytoplasm of each cell must fuse with the other in a process known as plasmogamy once within the joined cell membrane the nuclei are referred to as pronuclei once the cell membranes cytoplasm and pronuclei fuse together the resulting single cell is diploid containing two copies of the genome this diploid cell called a zygote or zygospore can then enter meiosis a process of chromosome duplication recombination and division to produce four new haploid cells or continue to divide by mitosis mammalian fertilization uses a comparable process to combine haploid sperm and egg cells gametes to create a diploid fertilized egg the term karyogamy comes from the greek karyo from karyon meaning nut and gamos meaning marriage haploid organisms such as fungi yeast and algae can have complex cell cycles in which the choice between sexual or asexual reproduction is fluid and often influenced by the environment some organisms in addition to their usual haploid state can also exist as diploid for a short time allowing genetic recombination to occur karyogamy can occur within either mode

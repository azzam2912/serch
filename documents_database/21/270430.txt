it provides the user with bearing and distance slant range or hypotenuse to a ground or ship borne station it is a more accurate version of the vor dme system that provides bearing and range information for civil aviation the dme portion of the tacan system is available for civil use at vortac facilities where a vor is combined with a tacan civil aircraft can receive vor dme readings aircraft equipped with tacan avionics can use this system for en route navigation as well as non precision approaches to landing fields the space shuttle is one such vehicle that was designed to use tacan navigation but later upgraded with gps as a replacement the typical tacan onboard user panel has control switches for setting the channel corresponding to the desired surface station s assigned frequency the operation mode for either transmit receive t r to get both bearing and range or receive only rec to get bearing but not range capability was later upgraded to include an air to air mode a a where two airborne users can get relative slant range information depending on the installation air to air mode may provide range closure relative velocity of the other

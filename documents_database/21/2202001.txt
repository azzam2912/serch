common rock types are orthogneiss granite metavolcanics and metasedimentary rocks on top of these lies is a widespread thin layer of unconsolidated deposits formed in connection to the quaternary ice ages for example eskers till and marine clay the topographic relief is rather subdued because mountain massifs were worn down to a peneplain long ago the bedrock of finland belongs to the fennoscandian shield and was formed by a succession of orogenies during the precambrian the oldest rocks of finland those of archean age are found in the east and north these rocks are chiefly granitoids and migmatitic gneiss rocks in central and western finland originated or were emplaced during the svecokarelian orogeny following this last orogeny rapakivi granites intruded various locations of finland during the mesoproterozoic and neoproterozoic especially in the land islands and in the southeast jotnian sediments occur usually together with rapakivi granites mountains that existed in precambrian time were eroded into a level terrain already during the late mesoproterozoic with proterozoic erosion amounting to tens of kilometers many of the precambrian rocks seen today in finland are the roots of ancient massifs as finland is in the older part of the fennoscandian shield its basement rocks

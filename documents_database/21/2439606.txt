several models of stochastic transitivity exist and have been used to describe the probabilities involved in experiments of paired comparisons specifically in scenarios where transitivity is expected however empirical observations of the binary relation is probabilistic for example players skills in a sport might be expected to be transitive i e if player a is better than b and b is better than c then player a must be better than c however in any given match a weaker players might still end up winning with a positive probability tighly matched players might have a higher chance of observing this inversion while players with large differences in their skills might only see these inversions happen seldomly stochastic transitivity models formalize such relations between the probabilities e g of an outcome of a match and the underlying transitive relation e g the skills of the players the standard non stochastic transitivity using the binary relation formula 1 is usually displayed as transitivity formula 2 where a b and c are alternatives of some pre determined set formula 3 while stochastic versions include of transitivity include 1 weak stochastic transitivity wst formula 4 2 strong stochastic transitivity sst formula 5 3 linear

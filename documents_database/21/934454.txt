diffusivity is encountered in fick s law and numerous other equations of physical chemistry the diffusivity is generally prescribed for a given pair of species and pairwise for a multi species system the higher the diffusivity of one substance with respect to another the faster they diffuse into each other typically a compound s diffusion coefficient is 10 000 as great in air as in water carbon dioxide in air has a diffusion coefficient of 16 mm s and in water its diffusion coefficient is 0 0016 mm s diffusivity has an si unit of m s length time in cgs units it is given in cm s the diffusion coefficient in solids at different temperatures is generally found to be well predicted by the arrhenius equation where an approximate dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature in liquids can often be found using stokes einstein equation which predicts that where the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature for gases can be expressed using chapman enskog theory predictions accurate on average to about 8 where for self diffusion in gases at two different pressures but the same temperature the following empirical equation has been suggested where in population dynamics

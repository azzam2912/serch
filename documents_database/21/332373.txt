it is a paramagnetic solid with a high melting point the compound is white but typical samples are often off white fecl crystallizes from water as the greenish tetrahydrate which is the form that is most commonly encountered in commerce and the laboratory there is also a dihydrate the compound is highly soluble in water giving pale green solutions hydrated forms of ferrous chloride are generated by treatment of wastes from steel production with hydrochloric acid such solutions are designated spent acid or pickle liquor especially when the hydrochloric acid is not completely consumed the spent acid requires treatment if it is disposed ferrous chloride is used in the manufacturing of ferric chloride ferrous chloride can also be used to regenerate hydrochloric acid it is also a byproduct from titanium production since some titanium ores contain iron ferrous chloride is prepared by addition of iron powder to a solution of hydrochloric acid in methanol this reaction gives the methanol solvate of the dichloride which upon heating in a vacuum at about 160 c converts to anhydrous fecl the net reaction is shown febr and fei can be prepared analogously an alternative synthesis of anhydrous ferrous chloride is the reduction of

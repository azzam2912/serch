it is used for categorical data see read and cressie beginning with a sample of formula 1 items each of which has been observed to fall into one of formula 2 categories it is possible to define formula 3 as the observed numbers of items in each cell hence formula 4 next defining a vector of parameters formula 5 where formula 6 these are the parameter values under the null hypothesis the exact probability of the observed configuration formula 7 under the null hypothesis is given by the significance probability for the test is the probability of occurrence of the data set observed or of a data set less likely than that observed if the null hypothesis is true using an exact test this is calculated as where the sum ranges over all outcomes as likely as or less likely than that observed in practice this becomes computationally onerous as formula 2 and formula 1 increase so it is probably only worth using exact tests for small samples for larger samples asymptotic approximations are accurate enough and easier to calculate one of these approximations is the likelihood ratio an alternative hypothesis can be defined under which each value formula 12

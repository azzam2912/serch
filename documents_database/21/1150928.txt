there are many experimental demonstrations of quantum sensing devices such as the experiments carried out by the nobel laureate william d phillips on using cold atom interferometer systems to measure gravity and the atomic clock which is used by many national standards agencies around the world to define the second recent efforts are being made to engineer quantum sensing devices so that they are cheaper easier to use more portable lighter and consume less power it is believed that if these efforts are successful it will lead to multiple commercial markets such as for the monitoring of oil and gas deposits or in construction quantum secure communication are methods which are expected to be quantum safe in the advent of a quantum computing systems that could break current cryptography systems one significant component of a quantum secure communication systems is expected to be quantum key distribution or qkd a method of transmitting information using entangled light in a way that makes any interception of the transmission obvious to the user quantum computers are the ultimate quantum network combining quantum bits or qubit which are devices that can store and process quantum data as opposed to binary data with links that

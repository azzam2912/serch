this is equivalent to the following two conditions a simple normal function is given by f 1 see ordinal arithmetic but f 1 is not normal if is a fixed ordinal then the functions f f for 1 and f for 2 are all normal more important examples of normal functions are given by the aleph numbers formula 1 which connect ordinal and cardinal numbers and by the beth numbers formula 2 if f is normal then for any ordinal proof if not choose minimal such that f supremum for set sup s and consider three cases every normal function f has arbitrarily large fixed points see the fixed point lemma for normal functions for a proof one can create a normal function f ord ord called the derivative of f such that f is the th fixed point of f

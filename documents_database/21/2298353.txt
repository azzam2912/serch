king darius i was unsuccessful in his invasion attempt and was followed by his son xerxes i who led the second persian wars which lasted from 480 to 479 bc xerxes saw more victories than his father successfully burning down athens following the persian wars the greek city states were left in disarray many buildings statues and fortifications of the greek city states were destroyed the people of athens were worried by a return of the persians and themistocles advocated rebuilding the walls before anything else so they decided to act upon this plan this project was opposed by the spartans and their peloponnesian allies alarmed by the increasing power of athens arguing that a walled athens would be a useful base for an invading army and that the defences of the isthmus of corinth would provide a sufficient shield against invaders the athenians went ahead to protect themselves from the peloponnesians thucydides in his account of these events describes a series of complex machinations by themistocles through which he distracted and delayed the spartans until the walls were built up high enough to provide adequate protection the themistoclean wall was completed in 479 bc and built with spolia old

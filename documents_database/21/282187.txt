cadherins are a class of type 1 transmembrane proteins they are dependent on calcium ca ions to function hence their name cell cell adhesion is mediated by extracellular cadherin domains whereas the intracellular cytoplasmic tail associates with numerous adaptor and signaling proteins collectively referred to as the cadherin adhesome the cadherin superfamily includes cadherins protocadherins desmogleins and desmocollins and more in structure they share cadherin repeats which are the extracellular ca binding domains there are multiple classes of cadherin molecule each designated with a prefix in general noting the type of tissue with which it is associated it has been observed that cells containing a specific cadherin subtype tend to cluster together to the exclusion of other types both in cell culture and during development for example cells containing n cadherin tend to cluster with other n cadherin expressing cells however it has been noted that the mixing speed in the cell culture experiments can have an effect on the extent of homotypic specificity in addition several groups have observed heterotypic binding affinity i e binding of different types of cadherin together in various assays one current model proposes that cells distinguish cadherin subtypes based on kinetic specificity rather than

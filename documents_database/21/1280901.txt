tangent lines to circles form the subject of several theorems and play an important role in many geometrical constructions and proofs since the tangent line to a circle at a point p is perpendicular to the radius to that point theorems involving tangent lines often involve radial lines and orthogonal circles a tangent line t to a circle c intersects the circle at a single point t for comparison secant lines intersect a circle at two points whereas another line may not intersect a circle at all this property of tangent lines is preserved under many geometrical transformations such as scalings rotation translations inversions and map projections in technical language these transformations do not change the incidence structure of the tangent line and circle even though the line and circle may be deformed the radius of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent line through its endpoint on the circle s circumference conversely the perpendicular to a radius through the same endpoint is a tangent line the resulting geometrical figure of circle and tangent line has a reflection symmetry about the axis of the radius no tangent line can be drawn through a point within a circle since any such

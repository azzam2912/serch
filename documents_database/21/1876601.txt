the battery was still in use during the second world war as a listening post and site for a bofors gun the six rml 10 inch 18 ton guns here were seen as the culmination of the idea of retired batteries originally most of gibraltar s guns were on the coast but major general sir john jones realised that setting them higher up the rock gave them more range and made them more difficult to hit the six guns here and at the other ridge batteries were as high as guns could be placed this battery however was different in that this was a high angle battery there was a growing realisation that the thickness of the armour carried by battleships at the end of the nineteenth century meant that they were almost impossible to penetrate with even the largest gun a new gun was devised this was the mark 6 rml gun and it was intended to fire high in the air such that it would hit the decks and not the armoured sides of the battleship these batteries would have been unusual with the guns and crews hidden from view because they were so far below the surface

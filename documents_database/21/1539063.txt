it is also called first arrival picking or first break detection first break picking can be done automatically manually or as a combination of both with the development of computer science and the size of seismic surveys automatic picking is often preferred first break picks associated with the refracted arrival times are used in an inversion scheme to study the near surface low velocity zone and subsequent determination of static corrections static correction is a correction applied to geophysical data especially seismic data to compensate for the effect of near surface irregularities differences in the elevation of shots and geophones or any application to correct the positions of source and receivers gelchinsky and shtivelman 1983 used correlation properties of signals and applied a statistical criterion for the estimation of first arrivals time coppens 1985 calculated the ratio of energy of seismogram of the two windows and used that to differentiate in signal and noise michael d mccormark et al 1993 introduced a backpropagation neural network bnn method the neural network which edits seismic data or pick first breaks was trained by users who were just selecting and presenting to the network examples of trace edits or refraction picks the network

for example one simple method not necessarily the best is to average the probabilities assigned by each model the random forest is another method it outputs the prediction that is the mode of the predictions output by individual models combining models is an active area of research in machine learning the paq series of data compression programs use context mixing to assign probabilities to individual bits of the input suppose that we are given two conditional probabilities formula 1 and formula 2 and we wish to estimate formula 3 the probability of event x given both conditions formula 4 and formula 5 there is insufficient information for probability theory to give a result in fact it is possible to construct scenarios in which the result could be anything at all but intuitively we would expect the result to be some kind of average of the two the problem is important for data compression in this application formula 4 and formula 5 are contexts formula 8 is the event that the next bit or symbol of the data to be compressed has a particular value and formula 1 and formula 2 are the probability estimates by two independent models the compression

particularly there is a group of problems that have been extensively studied where the input is an array of unsorted numbers and a query consists of computing some function such as the minimum on a specific range of the array a range query formula 1 on an array formula 2 of n elements of some set denoted formula 3 takes two indices formula 4 a function defined over arrays of elements of and outputs formula 5 for example for formula 6 and formula 3 an array of numbers the range query formula 8 computes formula 9 for any formula 10 these queries may be answered in constant time and using formula 11 extra space by calculating the sums of the first elements of and storing them into an auxiliary array such that formula 12 contains the sum of the first elements of for every formula 13 therefore any query might be answered by doing formula 14 this strategy may be extended for every group operator where the notion of formula 15 is well defined and easily computable finally this solution can be extended to two dimensional arrays with a similar preprocessing when the function of interest in a range query

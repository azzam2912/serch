it is a popular method for solving the large matrix equations that arise in systems theory and control and can be formulated to construct solutions in a memory efficient factored form it is also used to numerically solve parabolic and elliptic partial differential equations and is a classic method used for modeling heat conduction and solving the diffusion equation in two or more dimensions it is an example of an operator splitting method the adi method is a two step iteration process that alternately updates the column and row spaces of an approximate solution to formula 1 one adi iteration consists of the following steps 1 solve for formula 2 where formula 3 2 solve for formula 4 where formula 5 the numbers formula 6 are called shift parameters and convergence depends strongly on the choice of these parameters to perform formula 7 iterations of adi an initial guess formula 8 is required as well as formula 7 shift parameters formula 10 if formula 11 and formula 12 then formula 13 can be solved directly in formula 14 using the bartels stewart method it is therefore only beneficial to use adi when matrix vector multiplication and linear solves involving formula

magnesium zinc and iron are common impurities substituting for manganese bustamite is the high temperature polymorph of camnsio and johannsenite is the low temperature polymorph the inversion takes place at but may be very slow bustamite could be confused with light colored rhodonite or pyroxmangite but both these minerals are biaxial whereas bustamite is biaxial there is considerable variety in the literature about the size and type of the unit cell the formula to be used and the value of z the number of formula units per unit cell bustamite is a triclinic mineral which could be described by a primitive unit cell but the larger a centered cell is often preferred in order to facilitate comparison with the similar mineral wollastonite the formula for bustamite is camn sio but it is sometimes written ca mn sio and changing the formula in this way will change the value of z the structure is chains of sio tetraheda with repeat unit of three tetrahedra unlike the pyroxenes where the repeat unit is two ca and mn are positioned between the chains there are 12 tetrahedra in the a centered unit cell the unit cell the formula and z cannot be taken

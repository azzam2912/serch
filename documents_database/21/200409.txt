the potential may be external or it may be the result of the presence of another particle in the latter case one can equivalently define a bound state as a state representing two or more particles whose interaction energy exceeds the total energy of each separate particle one consequence is that given a potential vanishing at infinity negative energy states must be bound in general the energy spectrum of the set of bound states is discrete unlike free particles which have a continuous spectrum although not bound states in the strict sense metastable states with a net positive interaction energy but long decay time are often considered unstable bound states as well and are called quasi bound states examples include certain radionuclides and electrets in relativistic quantum field theory a stable bound state of particles with masses formula 1 corresponds to a pole in the s matrix with a center of mass energy less than formula 2 an unstable bound state shows up as a pole with a complex center of mass energy let be a complex separable hilbert space formula 4 be a one parameter group of unitary operators on and formula 5 be a statistical operator on let

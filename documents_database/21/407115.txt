in jet engines it increases engine thrust at low speeds and at takeoff water injection was used historically to increase the power output of military aviation engines for short durations such as dogfights or takeoff however it has also been used in motor sports and notably in drag racing in otto cycle engines the cooling effects of water injection also enables greater compression ratios by reducing engine knocking detonation alternately this reduction in engine knocking in otto cycle engines means that some applications gain significant performance when water injection is used in conjunction with a supercharger turbocharger or modifications such as aggressive ignition timing depending on the engine improvements in power and fuel efficiency can also be obtained solely by injecting water water injection may also be used to reduce nox or carbon monoxide emissions water injection is also used in some turbine engines and in some turboshaft engines normally when a momentary high thrust setting is needed to increase power and fuel efficiency water has a very high heat of vaporization as the ambient temperature water is injected into the engine heat transfers from the hot cylinder head and intake air into the water this makes it evaporate cooling

the reaction was discovered in the early 1900s by the russian chemist alexei yevgrafovich favorskii when the carbonyl is an aldehyde r h a rearrangement occurs and leads to an enone when this rearrangement is catalyzed by an acid it is called meyer schuster rearrangement a metal acetylide is formed in situ when an alkyne is treated with a strong bases such as a hydroxide or an alkoxide the metal acetylide then reacts with an aldehyde or ketone to form a propargyl alcohol when an hydrogen is present as is the case when the carbonyl is an aldehyde it will tautomerize to the corresponding enone the applicable substrates that undergo a favorskii reaction are limited when compared to the conventional reaction because using an excess of hydroxide base introduces aldol condensation as a more significant competing side reaction since enolates do not react with acetylene the reaction can be often be a poor substitute for the conventional reaction especially when reaction is used on aldehydes successful reactions with aldehydes often require special solvents to be used such as dmso or 1 2 dimethoxyethane with a trace amount of ethanol additionally lioh fails to form the necessary adduct with alkynes to

in other words for any point selected on the boundary of one of the lakes the other two lakes boundaries also contain that point more than two sets with the same boundary are said to have the wada property examples include wada basins in dynamical systems this property is rare in real world systems the lakes of wada were introduced by who credited the discovery to takeo wada his construction is similar to the construction by of an indecomposable continuum and in fact it is possible for the common boundary of the three sets to be an indecomposable continuum the lakes of wada are formed by starting with a closed unit square of dry land and then digging 3 lakes according to the following rule after an infinite number of days the three lakes are still disjoint connected open sets and the remaining dry land is the boundary of each of the 3 lakes for example the first five days might be see the image on the right a variation of this construction can produce a countable infinite number of connected lakes with the same boundary instead of extending the lakes in the order 1 2 0 1 2 0

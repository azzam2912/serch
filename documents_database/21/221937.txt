the first example of this attack in the wild was contributed by alexander peslyak on the bugtraq mailing list in 1997 on posix compliant operating systems the c standard library codice 1 is commonly used to provide a standard runtime environment for programs written in the c programming language although the attacker could make the code return anywhere codice 1 is the most likely target as it is almost always linked to the program and it provides useful calls for an attacker such as the codice 3 function used to execute shell commands a non executable stack can prevent some buffer overflow exploitation however it cannot prevent a return to libc attack because in the return to libc attack only existing executable code is used on the other hand these attacks can only call preexisting functions stack smashing protection can prevent or obstruct exploitation as it may detect the corruption of the stack and possibly flush out the compromised segment ascii armoring is a technique that can be used to obstruct this kind of attack with ascii armoring all the system libraries e g libc addresses contain a null byte 0x00 this is commonly done by placing them in the

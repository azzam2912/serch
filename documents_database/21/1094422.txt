it is defined as the derivative of charge with respect to potential in electrochemistry differential capacitance is a parameter introduced for characterizing electrical double layers where is surface charge and is electric surface potential capacitance is usually defined as the stored charge between two conducting surfaces separated by a dielectric divided by the voltage between the surfaces another definition is the rate of change of the stored charge or surface charge divided by the rate of change of the voltage between the surfaces or the electric surface potential the latter is called the differential capacitance but usually the stored charge is directly proportional to the voltage making the capacitances given by the two definitions equal this type of differential capacitance may be called parallel plate capacitance after the usual form of the capacitor however the term is meaningful when applied to any two conducting bodies such as spheres and not necessarily ones of the same size for example the elevated terminals of a tesla wireless system and the earth these are widely spaced insulated conducting bodies positioned over a spherically conducting ground plane the differential capacitance between the spheres is obtained by assuming opposite charges q on them another form

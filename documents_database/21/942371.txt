species in this group produce a disease called downy mildew and can infect many important crops from the 19 downy mildew producing genera hyaloperonospora has been grouped with perofascia in the brassicolous downy mildews in the group of downy mildews hyaloperonospora is the third biggest genus the most famous species in the genus is the hyaloperonospora parasitica or also known as hyaloperonospora arabidopsis this species has become a model organism from its ability to infect the model plant arabidopsis thaliana it is used to study plant pathogen interactions and is currently the only hyaloperonospora species that has an assembled genome in 2002 hyaloperonospora was discovered by g ker et al who used molecular phylogenetic techniques to argue that the group was different enough from the other peronospora species to be its own taxon hyaloperonospora along with perofascia were the first downy mildews described using their molecular phylogenies hyaloperonospora can be found on plants from about 20 different tribes of brassicaceae they can generally be found anywhere their host plant grows due to human transport from seed trade hyaloperonospora parasitica is unlike most other species in the family in that it has a very wide host range infecting a variety of

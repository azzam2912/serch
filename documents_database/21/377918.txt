it was introduced by eugene wigner in 1932 to study quantum corrections to classical statistical mechanics the goal was to link the wavefunction that appears in schr dinger s equation to a probability distribution in phase space it is a generating function for all spatial autocorrelation functions of a given quantum mechanical wavefunction thus it maps on the quantum density matrix in the map between real phase space functions and hermitian operators introduced by hermann weyl in 1927 in a context related to representation theory in mathematics cf weyl quantization in physics in effect it is the wigner weyl transform of the density matrix so the realization of that operator in phase space it was later rederived by jean ville in 1948 as a quadratic in signal representation of the local time frequency energy of a signal effectively a spectrogram in 1949 jos enrique moyal who had derived it independently recognized it as the quantum moment generating functional and thus as the basis of an elegant encoding of all quantum expectation values and hence quantum mechanics in phase space cf phase space formulation it has applications in statistical mechanics quantum chemistry quantum optics classical optics and signal analysis in diverse

it induces dna lesions usually corrected by nucleotide excision repair 4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide 4nqo is a quinoline a carcinogenic and mutagenic chemical quinolines like 4nqo possess a heterocyclic aromatic structure and the same basic chemical formula of c9h7n 4nqo may naturally occur in the environment but is typically manufactured for research purposes 4nqo is known to mimic the biological effects of ultraviolet light on various organisms both 4nqo and its reduced metabolite 4 hydroxyaminoquinoline 1 oxide 4haqo bind covalently to cellular macromolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins 4nqo has been shown to trap topoisomerase i cleavage complexes it may also induce dna damage through the production of reactive oxygen species thought to arise from enzymatic reduction of its nitro group although its exact mechanism is unknown 4nqo s reactive oxygen species may serve as a byproduct of dna damage or signaling molecule from damage in response to damage from 4nqo cells attempt to repair and initiate a transcriptional response to detoxify the cell from 4nqo and its metabolites dna damage by 4nqo is a potent model 4nqo induces dna lesions usually corrected by nucleotide excision repair 4nqo s four electron reduction product 4 hydroxyaminoquinoline 1 oxide 4haqo is

it combines passive elements fibre optic cabling patch panels splice boxes connectors and standard copper 8p8c patch cords and active mini switches called ftto switches to provide end devices with gigabit ethernet ftto involves centralised optical fibre cabling techniques to create a combined backbone horizontal channel this channel is provided from the work areas to the centralised cross connect or interconnect by allowing the use of pull through cables or splices in the telecommunications room ftto technology emerged in germany at the start of the 1980s when fibre based connectivity was extensively explored ftto appeared as a response to the growing network complexity the aim was to meet the following requirements ftto is a hybrid network involving fibre optic cabling pre terminated or extractable cables and copper twisted pair patch cords with 8p8c connectors in an ftto environment fibre is laid up vertically from the central distribution switch right to the office floor where it runs horizontally to active ftto switches at the users workplaces the final distance of 3 5 m to the end user desk is bridged using standard 8p8c twisted pair patch cords there are only two network levels the core and the access with no aggregation

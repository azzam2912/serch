it is a data subtype of the iff file container format it typically contains linear pulse code modulation lpcm digital audio the 8svx subtype stores 8 bit audio data within chunks contained within an iff file container 8svx subtypes can exist alone within iff file containers audio only or can be multiplexed together with other iff subtypes such as video animation streams metadata about the 8svx data stream is contained in separate descriptor chunks that come prior to the main data body chunk sample rate volume and compression type are described in a vhdr chunk various other chunks are available to describe the name author and copyright 8svx supports features such as attack release and section repeat which are useful for storage of musical instrument samples an example layout of an audio only 8svx iff audio file the majority of 8svx data streams are encoded using uncompressed linear pcm streams optionally fibonacci delta lossy data compression is also available resulting in a 50 compression ratio at the cost of decreased fidelity multi byte values are stored in big endian format the native byte order for the motorola 68000 family iff 8svx encoded audio was the default audio format for the

it supports agent based discrete event and system dynamics simulation methodologies anylogic is a cross platform simulation software as far as it works on windows macos and linux anylogic is used to simulate markets and competition healthcare manufacturing supply chains and logistics retail business processes social and ecosystem dynamics defense project and asset management pedestrian dynamics and road traffic it aerospace in the beginning of the 1990s there was a big interest in the mathematical approach to modeling and simulation of parallel processes this approach may be applied to the analysis of correctness of parallel and distributed programs the distributed computer network dcn research group at saint petersburg polytechnic university developed such a software system for the analysis of program correctness the new tool was named covers concurrent verification and simulation this system allowed graphical modeling notation for system structure and behavior the tool was applied for the research granted by hewlett packard in 1998 the success of this research inspired the dcn laboratory to organize a company with a mission to develop a new age simulation software the emphasis in the development was placed on applied methods simulation performance analysis behavior of stochastic systems optimization and visualization new software

it is essentially the same as the so called parabolic equation pe method in underwater acoustics both bpm and the pe were first introduced in the 1970s when a wave propagates along a waveguide for a large distance larger compared with the wavelength rigorous numerical simulation is difficult the bpm relies on approximate differential equations which are also called the one way models these one way models involve only a first order derivative in the variable z for the waveguide axis and they can be solved as initial value problem the initial value problem does not involve time rather it is for the spatial variable z the original bpm and pe were derived from the slowly varying envelope approximation and they are the so called paraxial one way models since then a number of improved one way models are introduced they come from a one way model involving a square root operator they are obtained by applying rational approximations to the square root operator after a one way model is obtained one still has to solve it by discretizing the variable z however it is possible to merge the two steps rational approximation to the square root operator and discretization

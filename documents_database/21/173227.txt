such a system is described by a set of parameters subject to differential constraints such that when the system evolves along a path in its parameter space the parameters varying continuously in values but finally returns to the original set of parameter values at the start of the path the system itself may not have returned to its original state more precisely a nonholonomic system also called an anholonomic system is one in which there is a continuous closed circuit of the governing parameters by which the system may be transformed from any given state to any other state because the final state of the system depends on the intermediate values of its trajectory through parameter space the system cannot be represented by a conservative potential function as can for example the inverse square law of the gravitational force this latter is an example of a holonomic system path integrals in the system depend only upon the initial and final states of the system positions in the potential completely independent of the trajectory of transition between those states the system is therefore said to be integrable while the nonholonomic system is said to be nonintegrable when a path integral is

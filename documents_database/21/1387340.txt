it most commonly consists of pickups potentiometers to adjust volume and tone a switch to select between different pickups if the instrument has more than one and the output socket there may be additional controls for specific functions the most common of these are described below the following section describes the most common components found inside an electric guitar pickups convert the mechanical energy of a vibrating string to an electrical signal allowing it to be amplified processed and reproduced pickups vary greatly in construction size types of materials used as well as various electrical properties but are generally divided into two categories single coil and double coil also known as humbucker potentiometers often abbreviated as pots can be used to control a variety of functions inside an electric guitar most often they function as tone and volume controls but can also blend two pickups together attenuate one coil of a humbucker and so on potentiometers are differentiated by their electrical characteristics of which the following are most important in an electric guitar besides the common pots used for volume and tone controls a number of specialised types exist capacitors often referred to as caps have several uses in electric

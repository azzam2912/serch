located in central tibet between the lhasa southern block and qiangtang northern block terranes it is a discontinuous belt of ophiolites and m lange that is 10 20 km wide up to 50 km wide in places the northern part of the fault zone consists of northeast striking sinistral strike slip faults while the southern part consists of northwest striking right lateral strike slip faults these conjugate faults to the north and south of the bangong intersect with each other along the bangong nujiang suture zone the geology of the suture includes jurassic marine shale and conglomeratic strata melange and ophiolites and volcanic rocks from multiple pulses of magmatism each of these lithologies can be tied to specific terranes either island arcs or microcontinents that were gathered in front of the indian subcontinent as it drifted northward during the mesozoic during the jurassic cretaceous collision of the lhasa and qiangtang terranes the ancient tethys ocean closed creating the bangong suture zone oceanic lithosphere the meso tethys was consumed during this collision and subducted under the qiangtang terrane this led to obduction of ophiolites on the northern margin of the lhasa terrane this period of obduction is generally accepted to mark

in a formal sense this is true even so the roots of cooperative extension extend as far back as the late 18th century following the american revolution when affluent farmers first began organizing groups to sponsor educational meetings to disseminate useful farming information in some cases these lectures even were delivered by university professors a practice that foreshadowed cooperative extension work more than a century later these efforts became more formalized over time by the 1850s for example many schools and colleges had begun holding farmer institutes public meetings where lecturers discussed new farming insights a milestone in the history of cooperative extension occurred in 1862 when congress passed and president abraham lincoln signed into law the morrill land grant college act which granted each state 30 000 acres 120 km of public land for each of its house and senate members states then could use this land as trust funds through which colleges could be endowed for the teaching of agriculture and other practical arts the morrill act made possible the formation of the agriculture and mechanical college of alabama later alabama polytechnic institute in 1872 succeeding the former east alabama male college a methodist institution established in 1856

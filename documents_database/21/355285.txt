when gas velocity goes down the dynamic pressure is reduced while the static pressure is increased the increased static pressure in the plenum chamber has a positive effect on engine power both because of the pressure itself and the increased air density that this higher pressure gives ram air systems are used on high performance vehicles most often on motorcycles and performance cars the 1990 kawasaki ninja zx 11 c1 model used a ram air intake the very first on any production motorcycle ram air was a feature on some cars in the sixties falling out of favor in the seventies but recently making a comeback while ram air intakes may increase the volumetric efficiency of an engine they can be difficult to combine with carburetors which rely on a venturi engineered pressure drop to draw fuel through the main jet as the pressurised ram air may kill this venturi effect the carburetor will need to be designed to take this into account or the engine may need fuel injection at low speeds subsonic speeds increases in static pressure are however limited to a few percent given that the air velocity is reduced to zero without losses the pressure increase

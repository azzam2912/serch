risc is responsible for the gene silencing phenomenon known as rna interference rnai argonaute proteins bind different classes of small non coding rnas including micrornas mirnas small interfering rnas sirnas and piwi interacting rnas pirnas small rnas guide argonaute proteins to their specific targets through sequence complementarity base pairing which then leads to mrna cleavage or translation inhibition the name of this protein family is derived from a mutant phenotype resulting from mutation of ago1 in arabidopsis thaliana which was likened by bohmert et al to the appearance of the pelagic octopus argonauta argo rna interference rnai is a biological process in which the rna molecules inhibit gene expression the method of inhibition is via the destruction of specific mrna molecules or by simply suppressing the protein translation the rna interference has a significant role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences in many eukaryotes including animals the rna interference pathway is found and it is initiated by the enzyme dicer dicer cleaves long double stranded rna dsrna molecules into short double stranded fragments of around 20 nucleotide sirnas the dsrna is then separated into two single stranded rnas ssrna the passenger strand and the guide strand subsequently the passenger

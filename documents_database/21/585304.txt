in particular if all codewords have a fixed length n then the binary code has length n equivalently in this case the codewords can be considered elements of vector space formula 2 over the finite field formula 3 let formula 4 be the minimum distance of formula 5 i e where formula 7 is the hamming distance between formula 8 and formula 9 the expression formula 10 represents the maximum number of possible codewords in a binary code of length formula 11 and minimum distance formula 4 the plotkin bound places a limit on this expression theorem plotkin bound i if formula 4 is even and formula 14 then ii if formula 4 is odd and formula 17 then iii if formula 4 is even then iv if formula 4 is odd then where formula 23 denotes the floor function let formula 7 be the hamming distance of formula 8 and formula 9 and formula 27 be the number of elements in formula 5 thus formula 27 is equal to formula 10 the bound is proved by bounding the quantity formula 31 in two different ways on the one hand there are formula 27 choices for formula 8 and for

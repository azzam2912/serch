there are two similar common forms as with the five number summary it can be represented by a modified box plot adding hatch marks on the whiskers for two of the additional numbers the following percentiles are evenly spaced under a normally distributed variable the middle three values the lower quartile median and upper quartile are the usual statistics from the five number summary and are the standard values for the box in a box plot the two unusual percentiles at either end are used because the locations of all seven values will be approximately equally spaced if the data is normally distributed four equally spaced percentiles with three digits of precision are 2 15 8 87 25 0 and 50 0 some statistical tests require normally distributed data so the plotted values provide a convenient visual check for validity of later tests simply by scanning to see if the marks for those seven percentiles appear to be equal distances apart on the graph notice that whereas the five number summary makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data the parametric seven number summary is based on the normal distribution and is not especially appropriate when normal data is

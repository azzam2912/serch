as this considerably reduced the fuel consumed hot blast was one of the most important technologies developed during the industrial revolution hot blast also allowed higher furnace temperatures which increased the capacity of furnaces as first developed it worked by alternately storing heat from the furnace flue gas in a firebrick lined vessel with multiple chambers then blowing combustion air through the hot chamber this is known as regenerative heating hot blast was invented and patented for iron furnaces by james beaumont neilson in 1828 at wilsontown ironworks in scotland but was later applied in other contexts including late bloomeries later the carbon monoxide in the flue gas was burned to provide additional heat james beaumont neilson previously foreman at glasgow gas works invented the system of preheating the blast for a furnace he found that by increasing the temperature of the incoming air to 300 degrees fahrenheit he could reduce the fuel consumption from 8 06 tons to 5 16 tons with further reductions at even higher temperatures he with partners including charles macintosh patented this in 1828 initially the heating vessel was made of wrought iron plates but these oxidized and he substituted a cast iron vessel on

the iqm is very similar to the scoring method used in sports that are evaluated by a panel of judges discard the lowest and the highest scores calculate the mean value of the remaining scores in calculation of the iqm only the data in the second and third quartiles is used as in the interquartile range and the lowest 25 and the highest 25 of the scores are discarded these points are called the first and third quartiles hence the name of the iqm note that the second quartile is also called the median assuming the values have been ordered the method is best explained with an example consider the following dataset first sort the list from lowest to highest there are 12 observations datapoints in the dataset thus we have 4 quartiles of 3 numbers discard the lowest and the highest 3 values we now have 6 of the 12 observations remaining next we calculate the arithmetic mean of these numbers this is the interquartile mean for comparison the arithmetic mean of the original dataset is due to the strong influence of the outlier 38 the above example consisted of 12 observations in the dataset which made the determination

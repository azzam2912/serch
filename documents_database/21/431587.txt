it combines supported hardware and z os software to provide asynchronous replication over long distances it is complementary to ibm s peer to peer remote copy pprc service which is designed to operate either synchronously or asynchronously over shorter distances xrc as a z os copy services solution can be compared to global mirror for ess which is a controller based solution for either the open systems or z series environments both global mirror for ess asynchronous pprc and xrc global mirror for z series are asynchronous replication technologies although their implementations are somewhat different extended remote copy or xrc is now known as global mirror for z series xrc xrc is a z series asynchronous disk mirroring technique which is effective over any distance it keeps the data time consistent across multiple ess enterprise storage server or hds hitachi data systems disk subsystems at the recovery site xrc functions as a combination of disk ibm ess or hds licensed microcode and application code running on a z series host and provides a recovery point that is time consistent across multiple disk subsystems the host component of the software is called the system data mover or sdm the sdm ensures

in smoothing the data points of a signal are modified so individual points presumably because of noise are reduced and points that are lower than the adjacent points are increased leading to a smoother signal smoothing may be used in two important ways that can aid in data analysis 1 by being able to extract more information from the data as long as the assumption of smoothing is reasonable and 2 by being able to provide analyses that are both flexible and robust many different algorithms are used in smoothing smoothing may be distinguished from the related and partially overlapping concept of curve fitting in the following ways however the terminology used across applications is mixed for example use of an interpolating spline fits a smooth curve exactly through the given data points and is sometimes called smoothing in the case that the smoothed values can be written as a linear transformation of the observed values the smoothing operation is known as a linear smoother the matrix representing the transformation is known as a smoother matrix or hat matrix the operation of applying such a matrix transformation is called convolution thus the matrix is also called convolution matrix or a

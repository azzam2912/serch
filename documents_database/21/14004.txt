the v6 is one of the most compact engine configurations usually ranging from 2 0 l to 4 3 l displacement and it is shorter than the inline 4 because of its short length the v6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front wheel drive layout the v6 is commercially successful in contemporary mid size cars because it is less expensive to build and is smoother in large sizes than the inline 4 which develops increasingly serious vibration problems in larger engines the wider 90 v6 will fit in an engine compartment designed for a v8 providing a low cost alternative to the v8 in an expensive car while the narrower 60 v6 will fit in most engine compartments designed for an i4 proving a more powerful and smoother alternative engine to the four buyers of luxury and or performance cars might prefer an inline 6 which has better smoothness or a flat 6 which has a lower center of gravity recent forced induction v6 engines have delivered horsepower and torque output comparable to contemporary larger displacement naturally aspirated v8 engines while reducing fuel consumption and emissions such as the volkswagen group s 3 0 tfsi which is

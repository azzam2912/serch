around 82 000 m2s were produced between 1957 and 1968 around 1500 m2s were produced by ernst leitz canada but most of these are not marked as such on the top plate the m2 was considered to be a more affordable simplified version of the 1954 leica m3 notably the frame counter of the m2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the film advance lever that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading this system was close to that of the leica iii series and unlike that of the m3 which is an independent frame counter visible through a window in the top plate that automatically resets to zero when the film take up spool is removed the rangefinder system was also simplified from that of the m3 and this made it potentially more prone to rangefinder flare the m2 has a rangefinder with a 0 72 magnification and framelines for 35 50 and 90mm lenses instead of the 0 91 magnification and 50 90 and 135mm framelines of the m3 this made it better suited for photojournalists who favour shorter lenses or for spectacle wearers using a 50mm lens who sometimes find it difficult to see

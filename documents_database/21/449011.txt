it was originally developed in the 1980s by jean raymond abrial in france and the uk b is related to the z notation also originated by abrial and supports development of programming language code from specifications b has been used in major safety critical system applications in europe such as the automatic paris m tro lines 14 and 1 and the ariane 5 rocket it has robust commercially available tool support for specification design proof and code generation compared to z b is slightly more low level and more focused on refinement to code rather than just formal specification hence it is easier to correctly implement a specification written in b than one in z in particular there is good tool support for this the same language is used in specification design and programming mechanisms include encapsulation and data locality recently another formal method called event b has been developed event b is considered an evolution of b also known as classical b it is a simpler notation which is easier to learn and use it comes with tool support in the form of the rodin tool b notation depends on set theory and first order logic in order to

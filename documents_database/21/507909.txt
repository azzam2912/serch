air force project in the 1990s and early 2000s run by nasa and the air force research laboratory afrl to develop a new rocket engine front end powerhead that would utilize a full flow staged combustion cycle ffscc the prime contractors were rocketdyne and aerojet the long term design goal was to apply the advantages of ffscc to create a reusable engine with improved life reliability and performance the powerhead demonstrator project was to develop a demonstrator design of what could become the front end for a future engine development project no subsequent funding was made available by public policymakers so no full engine design was ever completed the turbines were also planned to feature hydrostatic bearings instead of the traditional ball bearings on july 19 2006 rocketdyne announced that the demonstrator engine front end had been operated at full capacity according to nasa the ipd project was the first of three phases of the integrated high payoff rocket propulsion technology program which was aimed at demonstrating technologies that double the capability of state of the art cryogenic booster engines the project s goal in 2005 was to develop a full flow hydrogen fueled staged combustion rocket engine in 2007

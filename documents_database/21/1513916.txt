the objective is to enable the study of astrobiology and to aid the planning of extraterrestrial exploration missions while prioritizing science technology and field campaigns astep is one of four elements of nasa s astrobiology program which falls under the planetary science division of the science mission directorate according to the formal description from nasa the astep program sponsors the development of technologies that enable remote searches for and identification of life in extreme environments including planetary surfaces and subsurfaces astep is concerned with discovering technologies which will enable scientists to study astrobiology both on the surface of the earth and on extraterrestrial bodies a central focus of astep s research is terrestrial field campaigns or long duration expeditions where researchers live in the same region they are studying these are conducted on earth in remote or hostile locations such as antarctica or the bottom of the ocean through understanding complex and exotic life on earth such as extremophiles scientists hope to better define the characteristics they should look for and the locations they should seek when attempting to discover extraterrestrial life astep funded projects typically perform research by searching for and studying extremophile biology in earth s harshest environments

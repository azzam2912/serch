with manufacturing tolerances and variables in production most devices produced do not exactly meet the bogey value for each parameter apart from a bogey device being a theoretical device that has the given characteristics the term can refer to a specially selected example of a device e g from a production run where care is taken to ensure each characteristic has its nominal value for example a bogey tube could be used to calibrate tube testers and be expected to give readings in the middle of the meter s good region hence a tube can be specified by its bogey values and suitable tolerances and tests are based on the bogey values for applications such as music amplifiers where the channels need to have nearly identical performance it is desirable that components are matched and have major parameter values close to bogey

carbon 12 is of particular importance in its use as the standard from which atomic masses of all nuclides are measured thus its atomic mass is exactly 12 daltons by definition carbon 12 is composed of 6 protons 6 neutrons and 6 electrons before 1959 both the iupap and iupac used oxygen to define the mole the chemists defining the mole as the number of atoms of oxygen which had mass 16 g the physicists using a similar definition but with the oxygen 16 isotope only the two organizations agreed in 1959 60 to define the mole as follows the mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 12 gram of carbon 12 its symbol is mol this was adopted by the cipm international committee for weights and measures in 1967 and in 1971 it was adopted by the 14th cgpm general conference on weights and measures in 1961 the isotope carbon 12 was selected to replace oxygen as the standard relative to which the atomic weights of all the other elements are measured in 1980 the cipm clarified the above definition defining that the carbon 12 atoms

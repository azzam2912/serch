it is often created by applying a voltage between two electrodes in a glass tube containing a low pressure gas when the voltage exceeds a value called the striking voltage the gas ionization becomes self sustaining and the tube glows with a colored light the color depends on the gas used glow discharges are used as a source of light in devices such as neon lights fluorescent lamps and plasma screen televisions analyzing the light produced with spectroscopy can reveal information about the atomic interactions in the gas so glow discharges are used in plasma physics and analytical chemistry they are also used in the surface treatment technique called sputtering conduction in a gas requires charge carriers which can be either electrons or ions charge carriers come from ionizing some of the gas molecules in terms of current flow glow discharge falls between dark discharge and arc discharge below the breakdown voltage there is no or little glow and the electric field is uniform when the electric field increases enough to cause ionization the townsend discharge starts when a glow discharge develops the electric field is considerably modified by the presence of positive ions the field is concentrated near the

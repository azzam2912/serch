the concept was first proposed by nobel laureate reinhard selten in 1970 who considered the case where the aggregate is the sum of the players strategies consider a standard non cooperative game with n players where formula 1 is the strategy set of player i formula 2 is the joint strategy set and formula 3 is the payoff function of player i the game is then called an aggregative game if for each player i there exists a function formula 4 such that for all formula 5 in words payoff functions in aggregative games depend on players own strategies and the aggregate formula 7 as an example consider the cournot model where firm i has payoff profit function formula 8 here formula 9 and formula 10 are respectively the inverse demand function and the cost function of firm i this is an aggregative game since formula 11 where formula 12 a number of generalizations of the standard definition of an aggregative game have appeared in the literature a game is generalized aggregative if there exists an additively separable function formula 13 i e if there exist increasing functions formula 14 such that formula 15 such that for each player i

a live bottom trailer is the alternative to a dump truck or an end dump trailer the typical live bottom trailer has a conveyor belt on the bottom of the trailer tub that pushes the material out of the back of the trailer at a controlled pace unlike the conventional dump truck the tub does not have to be raised to deposit the materials even though the live bottom truck is impractical theoretically it is powered by a hydraulic system when the operator engages the truck hydraulic system it activates the conveyor belt moving the load horizontally out of the back trailer live bottom trailers can haul a variety of products including gravel potatoes top soil grain carrots sand lime peat moss asphalt compost rip rap heavy rocks etc those who work in industries such as the agriculture and construction benefit from the versatility of the trailer and chassis mount the live bottom trailer eliminates trailer roll over because the tub does not have to be raised in the air to unload the materials the trailer has a lower centre of gravity which makes it easy for the trailer to unload in an uneven area compared to dump trailers that

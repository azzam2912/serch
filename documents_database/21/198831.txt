line of visibility between the aircraft and ground station is required an interrogator airborne initiates an exchange by transmitting a pulse pair on an assigned channel to the transponder ground station the channel assignment specifies the carrier frequency and the spacing between the pulses after a known delay the transponder replies by transmitting a pulse pair on a frequency that is offset from the interrogation frequency by 63 mhz and having specified separation dme systems are used worldwide their standards are set forth by the international civil aviation organization icao rtca the european union aviation safety agency easa and other bodies some countries require that aircraft operating under instrument flight rules ifr be equipped with a dme interrogator in some other countries a dme interrogator is only required for conducting certain operations while stand alone dme transponders are permitted dme transponders are usually paired with an azimuth guidance system to provide aircraft with a two dimensional navigation capability a common combination is a dme colocated with a vor vhf omnidirectional range transmitter in a single ground station when this occurs the frequencies of the vor and dme equipment are paired such a configuration enables an aircraft to determine its azimuth

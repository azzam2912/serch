msrs offer multiple advantages over conventional nuclear power plants although for historical reasons they have not been deployed the concept was first established in the 1950s the early aircraft reactor experiment was primarily motivated by the small size that the technique offered while the molten salt reactor experiment was a prototype for a thorium fuel cycle breeder nuclear power plant the increased research into generation iv reactor designs renewed interest in the technology msr research started with the u s aircraft reactor experiment are in support of the u s aircraft nuclear propulsion program are was a 2 5 mw nuclear reactor experiment designed to attain a high energy density for use as an engine in a nuclear powered bomber the project included experiments including high temperature and engine tests collectively called the heat transfer reactor experiments htre 1 htre 2 and htre 3 at the national reactor test station now idaho national laboratory as well as an experimental high temperature molten salt reactor at oak ridge national laboratory the are are used molten fluoride salt naf zrf uf 53 41 6 mol as fuel moderated by beryllium oxide beo liquid sodium was a secondary coolant the experiment had a

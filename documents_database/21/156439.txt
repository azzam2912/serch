it is of minor importance in humans except in the very rare case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha hydroxylase deficiency in many species including amphibians reptiles rodents and birds corticosterone is a main glucocorticoid involved in regulation of energy immune reactions and stress responses however in humans cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid that is produced primarily in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex corticosterone has only weak glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid potencies in humans and is important mainly as an intermediate in the steroidogenic pathway from pregnenolone to aldosterone corticosterone is converted to aldosterone by aldosterone synthase found only in the mitochondria of glomerulosa cells glomerulosa cells are found in the zona glomerulosa which is the most superficial region of endocrine cells in the adrenal cortex corticosterone is the precursor molecule to the mineralocorticoid aldosterone one of the major homeostatic modulators of sodium and potassium levels in vivo one example of a release pathway relates to uv b stimulation on the skins of certain amphibians such as the rough skinned newt taricha granulosa this trigger seems to cause the internal generation of corticosterone in that species a sizable amount of research has been done on the effects

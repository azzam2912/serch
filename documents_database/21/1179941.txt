given positive and negative examples of some concept and a set of background knowledge predicates foil inductively generates a logical concept definition or rule for the concept the induced rule must not involve any constants color x red becomes color x y red y or function symbols but may allow negated predicates recursive concepts are also learnable like the id3 algorithm foil hill climbs using a metric based on information theory to construct a rule that covers the data unlike id3 however foil uses a separate and conquer method rather than divide and conquer focusing on creating one rule at a time and collecting uncovered examples for the next iteration of the algorithm the foil algorithm is as follows suppose foil s task is to learn the concept grandfather x y given the relations father x y and parent x y furthermore suppose our current body consists of grandfather x y parent x z this can be extended by conjoining body with any of the literals father x x father y z parent u y or many others to create this literal the algorithm must choose both a predicate name and a set of variables for the predicate at least

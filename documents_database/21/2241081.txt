the substance finds industrial application as a stabilizer and inhibitor for enzymes and as a bactericide the synthesis of 4 formylyphenylboronic acid was reported by the group of heinrich n th in 1990 4 bromobenzaldehyde was used as starting material the acetalization of the aldehyde group was carried out by standard methods using diethoxymethoxyethane and ethanol to give 1 bromo 4 diethoxymethyl benzene the formation of the grignard compound with magnesium requires 1 2 dibromoethane and activation with ultrasound reaction with tri n butyl borate leads to the protected aryl boronic ester which gives after acidic work up the target product in 78 yield the same reactants are forming with the aryl boronic ester at 60 c 4 formylyphenylboronic acid with a 99 yield when activated with sodium bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminumhydride also on the kilogram scale when the aryllithium compound of 1 bromo 4 diethoxymethyl benzene is used with triisopropylborate at 78 c instead of the grignard compound via n butyllithium 4 formylphenylboronic acid is obtained in 99 crude yield disadvantages of both routes are the high price of the educts used such as 4 bromobenzaldehyde boronic esters of higher alcohols and butyllithium as well as in the n

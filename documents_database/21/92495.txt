it is about in diameter about a tenth of that of saturn s largest moon titan enceladus is mostly covered by fresh clean ice making it one of the most reflective bodies of the solar system consequently its surface temperature at noon only reaches far colder than a light absorbing body would be despite its small size enceladus has a wide range of surface features ranging from old heavily cratered regions to young tectonically deformed terrains enceladus was discovered on august 28 1789 by william herschel but little was known about it until the two voyager spacecraft voyager 1 and voyager 2 passed nearby in the early 1980s in 2005 the cassini spacecraft started multiple close flybys of enceladus revealing its surface and environment in greater detail in particular cassini discovered water rich plumes venting from the south polar region cryovolcanoes near the south pole shoot geyser like jets of water vapor molecular hydrogen other volatiles and solid material including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles into space totaling about per second over 100 geysers have been identified some of the water vapor falls back as snow the rest escapes and supplies most of the material making up saturn s

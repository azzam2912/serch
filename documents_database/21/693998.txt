an taoiseach was a landmark decision of the irish supreme court which found that ireland could not ratify the single european act unless the irish constitution was first changed to permit its ratification the case taken by raymond crotty directly led to the tenth amendment of the constitution of ireland which authorised the ratification of the single act and established that significant changes to european union treaties required an amendment to the irish constitution before they could be ratified by ireland as a consequence the republic of ireland uniquely in the eu requires a plebiscite for every new or substantive change to a european union treaty the substantive issues in the case revolved around the interpretation of part iii of the single european act which codified cooperation on foreign policy matters between the governments of the then twelve member states of the european economic community referred to as european political cooperation into an international agreement the majority of the court ruled that if the state ratified part iii it would amount to an unconstitutional delegation of the state s external sovereignty the dissenting judges argued that the provisions only constituted a requirement to listen and consult the supreme court decision

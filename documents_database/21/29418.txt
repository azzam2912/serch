estuaries are subject both to marine influences such as tides waves and the influx of saline water and to riverine influences such as flows of fresh water and sediment the mixing of seawater and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world most existing estuaries formed during the holocene epoch with the flooding of river eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10 000 12 000 years ago estuaries are typically classified according to their geomorphological features or to water circulation patterns they can have many different names such as bays harbors lagoons inlets or sounds although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and may be fully saline many estuaries suffer degradation from a variety of factors including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation overgrazing and other poor farming practices overfishing drainage and filling of wetlands eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes pollutants including heavy metals polychlorinated biphenyls radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs and diking or damming for flood control or water

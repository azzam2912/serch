it is a gla domain protein and thus vitamin k dependent and its functionality is therefore impaired in warfarin therapy it is a glycoprotein although it is not enzymatically active it is structurally related to several serine proteases of the coagulation cascade factors vii ix x and protein c the carboxyglutamate residues which require vitamin k bind protein z to phospholipid surfaces the main role of protein z appears to be the degradation of factor xa this is done by protein z related protease inhibitor zpi but the reaction is accelerated 1000 fold by the presence of protein z oddly zpi also degrades factor xi but this reaction does not require the presence of protein z in some studies deficiency states have been associated with a propensity to thrombosis others however link it to bleeding tendency there is no clear explanation for this as it acts physiologically as an inhibitor and deficiency would logically have led to a predisposition for thrombosis it is 62 kda large and 396 amino acids long the proz gene has been linked to the thirteenth chromosome 13q34 it has four domains a gla rich region two egf like domains and a trypsin like domain it

it is analogous to taurine but with an extra carbon in its chain it has gabaergic activity apparently by mimicking gaba which it resembles homotaurine was investigated in a phase iii clinical trial as a potential treatment for alzheimer s disease that did not show efficacy a study in cognitive impairment done in 2018 did show positive benefits in preclinical studies it had been found to bind to soluble amyloid beta and inhibit the formation of neurotoxic aggregates homotaurine has also shown anticonvulsant activities reduction in skeletal muscle tonus and hypothermic activity homotaurine has been reported as a gaba antagonist as well as a gaba agonist in vitro studies have found that homotaurine is a gaba partial agonist as well as a gaba receptor partial agonist with low efficacy becoming an antagonist and displacing the full agonists gaba and baclofen at this receptor in a study in rats homotaurine reversed the catatonia induced by baclofen the prototypical gaba agonist and was able to produce analgesia via the gaba receptor an effect that was abolished when cgp 35348 a gaba receptor antagonist was applied one study in rats showed that homotaurine suppressed ethanol stimulated dopamine release as well as ethanol intake

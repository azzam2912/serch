in an oil in water emulsion oil is the discrete phase while water is the continuous phase what the bancroft rule states is that contrary to common sense what makes an emulsion oil in water or water in oil is not the relative percentages of oil or water but which phase the emulsifier is more soluble in so even though there may be a formula that s 60 oil and 40 water if the emulsifier chosen is more soluble in water it will create an oil in water system there are some exceptions to bancroft s rule but it s a very useful rule of thumb for most systems the hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb of a surfactant can be used in order to determine whether it s a good choice for the desired emulsion or not bancroft s rule suggests that the type of emulsion is dictated by the emulsifier and that the emulsifier should be soluble in the continuous phase this empirical observation can be rationalised by considering the interfacial tension at the oil surfactant and water surfactant interfaces

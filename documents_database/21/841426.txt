the electrocity was based on daf vdl sb120 chassis for most of these buses except for a single dennis dart slf prototype two electrocity prototypes were initially built in 2002 one based on daf sb120 chassis the other based on a dennis dart slf chassis the bodywork design was similar to the existing wright cadet and crusader which were also built on daf sb120 and dennis dart slf chassis respectively with the addition of battery pods on the roof of the electrocity being the main difference the electrocity was the first bus of its kind to be built and the prototypes competed mainly with the transbus enviro200h the electrocity design was facelifted in 2005 to match the updated cadet design with the main noticeable change being rounded front headlights following the collapse of transbus international in 2004 and subsequent cancellation of the enviro200h programme in february 2006 london central placed six electrocitys based on vdl sb120 chassis into service on route 360 originally equipped with lead acid batteries and 1 9 litre vauxhall engines in 2011 all were rebuilt by wrightbus with lithium ion batteries and 4 5 litre cummins isbe engines the hybrid management system was converted from enova

the average value of voltage and current fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate the longer the switch is on compared to the off periods the higher the total power supplied to the load along with mppt maximum power point tracking it is one of the primary methods of reducing the output of solar panels to that which can be utilized by a battery pwm is particularly suited for running inertial loads such as motors which are not as easily affected by this discrete switching because they have inertia to react slow the pwm switching frequency has to be high enough not to affect the load which is to say that the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible the rate or frequency at which the power supply must switch can vary greatly depending on load and application for example switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove 120 hz in a lamp dimmer between a few kilohertz khz and tens of khz for a motor drive and well into the tens or hundreds of khz

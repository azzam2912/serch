it received this designation when the star was catalogued by bode in his uranographia this is a rather dim naked eye star with an apparent visual magnitude of 5 54 based upon an annual parallax shift of just 6 28 mas it is around distant from the sun give or take a 30 light year margin of error the spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of b9 iv or b9 v the iv luminosity class would indicate the star is in the subgiant stage while a v class means it is a main sequence star like the sun in the latter case it is close to entering the subgiant stage at an estimated 93 of the way through its lifespan on the main sequence rho arae has more than three times the mass of the sun and shines with 238 times the sun s luminosity this energy is being radiated into space from the outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 10 520 k giving it the blue white hue of a b type star it is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 302 km s

the technique can accurately establish the position of the needle by monitoring the force exerted cells to be used for tracking diagnosing and treatment of illness may be removed from the body and replaced after being injected the 100 nm diameter needles were cut from silicon afm tips using focused ion beam etching in 2009 researchers at the university of illinois produced a 50 nm diameter boron nitride nanoneedle with a thin coating of gold suitable for biophysical research its diameter allows easy penetration of cell walls in order to deliver organic matter or fluorescent quantum dots into the cytoplasm or the nucleus it may also be used as electrochemical probe or optical biosensor in a cellular environment the university of california berkeley in 2008 produced gallium arsenide gaas nanoneedles which emit extremely bright light though not yet lasers when optically pumped with a length of 3 4 micrometres they taper to tips of 2 5 nm across in addition to optoelectronic devices the needles will be useful in atomic force microscopy afm and can be easily grown in arrays such afm arrays besides producing near atomic resolution images of surfaces could lead to new forms of data storage by

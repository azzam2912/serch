mole fraction or mass fraction since these fractions are quantity per quantity measures they are pure numbers with no associated units of measurement commonly used are ppm parts per million ppb parts per billion ppt parts per trillion and ppq parts per quadrillion this notation is not part of the si system and its meaning is ambiguous parts per notation is often used describing dilute solutions in chemistry for instance the relative abundance of dissolved minerals or pollutants in water the quantity 1 ppm can be used for a mass fraction if a water borne pollutant is present at one millionth of a gram per gram of sample solution when working with aqueous solutions it is common to assume that the density of water is 1 00 g ml therefore it is common to equate 1 kilogram of water with 1 l of water consequently 1 ppm corresponds to 1 mg l and 1 ppb corresponds to 1 g l similarly parts per notation is used also in physics and engineering to express the value of various proportional phenomena for instance a special metal alloy might expand 1 2 micrometers per meter of length for every degree celsius and this

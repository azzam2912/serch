the protein localizes to the nucleus and is thought to associate with specific chromatin regions the protein is a member of the tripartite motif family this tripartite motif includes three zinc binding domains a ring a b box type 1 and a b box type 2 and a coiled coil region kap1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in many critical functions including transcriptional regulation cellular differentiation and proliferation dna damage repair viral suppression and apoptosis 4 its functionality is dependent upon post translational modifications phosphorylation of kap1 acts as a deactivator of the protein in many of its mechanisms while sumoylation acts as an activator studies have shown that deletion of kap1 in mice before gastrulation results in death implicating it as a necessary protein for proliferation while deletion in adult mice results in increased anxiety and stress induced alterations in learning and memory kap1 has been shown to participate in the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and to promote and inhibit cellular differentiation of adult cell lines increased levels of kap1 have been found in liver gastric breast lung and prostate cancers as well indicating that it may play an important role in tumor cell proliferation

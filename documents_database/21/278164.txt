the size of such a particle ranges from 50 m to 2 mm usually found on earth s surface micrometeorites differ from meteorites in that they are smaller in size more abundant and different in composition they are a subset of cosmic dust which also includes the smaller interplanetary dust particles idps micrometeorites enter earth s atmosphere at high velocities at least 11 km s and undergo heating through atmospheric friction and compression micrometeorites individually weigh between 10 and 10 g and collectively comprise most of the extraterrestrial material that has come to the present day earth fred lawrence whipple first coined the term micro meteorite to describe dust sized objects that fall to the earth sometimes meteoroids and micrometeoroids entering the earth s atmosphere are visible as meteors or shooting stars whether or not they reach the ground and survive as meteorites and micrometeorites micrometeorite mm textures vary as their original structural and mineral compositions are modified by the degree of heating that they experience entering the atmosphere a function of their initial speed and angle of entry they range from unmelted particles that retain their original mineralogy fig 1 a b to partially melted particles fig 1 c

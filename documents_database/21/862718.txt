tyrosine hydroxylase phenylalanine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase together constitute the family of biopterin dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases tph catalyzes the following chemical reaction it employs one additional cofactor iron it is responsible for addition of the ho group hydroxylation to the 5 position to form the amino acid 5 hydroxytryptophan 5 htp which is the initial and rate limiting step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin it is also the first enzyme in the synthesis of melatonin tryptophan hydroxylase tph tyrosine hydroxylase th and phenylalanine hydroxylase pah are members of a superfamily of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases catalyzing key steps in important metabolic pathways analogously to phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase this enzyme uses 6r l erythro 5 6 7 8 tetrahydrobiopterin bh and dioxygen as cofactors in humans the stimulation of serotonin production by administration of tryptophan has an antidepressant effect and inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase e g by p chlorophenylalanine may precipitate depression the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase i e the rate at which it converts l tryptophan into the serotonin precursor l 5 hydroxytryptophan can be increased when it undergoes phosphorylation protein kinase a for example can phosphorylate tryptophan hydroxylase thus increasing its activity in

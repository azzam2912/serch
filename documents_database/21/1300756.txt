he made fundamental contributions in the fields of 3 manifolds and algebraic k theory waldhausen studied mathematics at the universities of g ttingen munich and bonn he obtained his ph d in 1966 from the university of bonn his advisor was friedrich hirzebruch and his thesis was entitled eine klasse von 3 dimensionalen mannigfaltigkeiten a class of 3 dimensional manifolds after visits to princeton university the university of illinois and the university of michigan he moved in 1968 to the university of kiel where he completed his habilitation qualified to assume a professorship in 1969 he was appointed professor at the ruhr university bochum before in 1970 becoming a professor at bielefeld university an appointment he held until his retirement in 2004 his early work was mainly on the theory of 3 manifolds he dealt mainly with haken manifolds and heegaard splitting among other things he proved that roughly speaking any homotopy equivalence of haken manifolds is homotopic to a homeomorphism i e that closed haken manifolds are topologically rigid he put forward the waldhausen conjecture about heegaard splitting in the mid seventies he extended the connection between geometric topology and algebraic k theory by introducing a kind of algebraic

the most common or classical type of hiv associated nephropathy is a collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs though other forms of kidney disease may also occur regardless of the underlying histology renal disease in hiv positive patients is associated with an increased risk of death hivan may be caused by direct infection of the renal cells by hiv with resulting renal damage through the viral gene products it could also be caused by the release of cytokines during hiv infection usually occurs only in advanced hiv disease and approximately 80 of patients with hivan have a cd4 count of less than 200 hivan presents with nephrotic syndrome and progressive kidney failure despite being a cause of chronic kidney failure kidney sizes are usually normal or large abnormalities involve all components of the nephron typical findings are that of collapsing capillary loops areas of scarring called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs microcystic tubular dilatation that is highly echogenic and prominent podocytes the characteristic feature of collapsing glomerulopathy is collapse of glomerular tuft and proliferation and hyperplasia of glomerular visceral epithelial cells its prognosis is always poor as it rapidly progresses to chronic kidney disease there are no adequate data from randomised controlled

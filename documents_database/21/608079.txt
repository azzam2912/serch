it is said to be able to take the sickness into itself and then fly away dispersing the sickness and healing both itself and the sick person the caladrius legend formed part of medieval bestiary materials which typically provided a christian moralization for the animals they discussed it has been theorized that the caladrius is based on a real bird due to descriptions of it being completely white with no black on it it is possible that it was based on the dove or possibly some sort of water bird such as the heron louis reau believes it was most likely a white plover medieval interpretations focused on the diagnostic potential of the bird if it looks into the face of a sick person the person will live if it looks away the person will die this is compatible with the idea that the caladrius look draws the sickness into itself the bird is then said to fly up to the sun where the disease is burned up and destroyed in the christian moralization the caladrius represents christ who is pure white without a trace of the blackness of sin the bird shows how christ turns away from unrepentant sinners

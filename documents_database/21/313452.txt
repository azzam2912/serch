for instance formula 1 can be recognized as a sum because it can be broken into formula 2 also a sum and formula 3 a suitable suffix in terms of context free grammar a nonterminal is left recursive if the leftmost symbol in one of its productions is itself in the case of direct left recursion or can be made itself by some sequence of substitutions in the case of indirect left recursion a grammar is left recursive if and only if there exists a nonterminal symbol formula 4 that can derive to a sentential form with itself as the leftmost symbol symbolically where formula 6 indicates the operation of making one or more substitutions and formula 7 is any sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols direct left occurs when the definition can be satisfied with only one substitution it requires a rule of the form where formula 7 is a sequence of nonterminals and terminals for example the rule is directly left recursive a left to right recursive descent parser for this rule might look like and such code would fall into infinite recursion when executed indirect left recursion occurs when the definition of left recursion is satisfied via

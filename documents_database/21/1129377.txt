constraints on locality limit the span over which rules can apply to a particular structure theories of transformational grammar use syntactic locality constraints to explain restrictions on argument selection syntactic binding and syntactic movement locality is observed in a number of linguistic contexts and most notably with the projection principle requires that lexical properties in particular argument structure properties such as thematic roles be projected onto syntactic structures together with locality of selection which forces lexical properties to be projected within a local projection as defined by x bar theory the projection principle constrains syntactic trees syntactic trees are represented through constituents of a sentence which are represented in a hierarchical fashion in order to satisfy locality of selection through the restraints of x bar theory in x bar theory immediate dominance relations are invariant meaning that all languages have the same constituent structure however the linear precedence relations can vary across languages for example word order i e constituent order can vary with and across languages if selects then depends on if selects and if locality of selection is satisfied then and are in a local dependency if selects and if locality of selection is not satisfied then and

the donkeys were moved by simply dragging themselves with the winch line they were used to move logs by attaching lines to the logs and hauling them the donkey puncher was the machine operator and engineer use of the term gained currency in 1920 in later times the donkey puncher was too far away from the end of the line for verbal communication so whistle codes steam whistles were employed the whistle operator was known as a whistle punk who was placed between the men attaching the cables choker setters and the donkey puncher so that he could see the choker setters when the cables were attached a series of whistle blows signaled the donkey to begin pulling and the choker setters to stay out of harm s way this is an oversimplification of a closely orchestrated sequence of operations where mistakes were often fatal and where good men stood in line for the jobs although the steam engine and its whistle have been replaced by gasoline and diesel engines the whistle codes are still used in many current logging operations the whistle has been replaced largely with airhorns

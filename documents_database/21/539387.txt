are integers satisfying 0 a 9 called the digits of the decimal representation the sequence of digits specified may be finite in which case any further digits a are assumed to be 0 some authors forbid decimal representations with a trailing infinite sequence of 9 s this restriction still allows a decimal representation for each non negative real number but additionally makes such a representation unique the number defined by a decimal representation is often written more briefly as that is to say a is the integer part of r not necessarily between 0 and 9 and a a a are the digits forming the fractional part of r both notations above are by definition the following limit of a sequence any real number can be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy by rational numbers with finite decimal representations assume formula 4 then for every integer formula 5 there is a finite decimal formula 6 such that proof let formula 8 where formula 9 then formula 10 and the result follows from dividing all sides by formula 11 some real numbers formula 13 have two infinite decimal representations for example the number 1 may be equally represented by 1

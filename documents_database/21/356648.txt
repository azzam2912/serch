ucl requires no additional memory to be allocated for decompression a considerable advantage that means that a upx packed executable usually requires no additional memory upx since 2 90 beta can use lzma on most platforms however this is disabled by default for 16 bit due to slow decompression speed on older computers use codice 1 to force it on starting with version 3 91 upx also supports 64 bit x64 executable files on the windows platform this feature is currently declared as experimental upx supports two mechanisms for decompression an in place technique and extraction to temporary file the in place technique which decompresses the executable into memory is not possible on all supported platforms the rest uses extraction to temporary file this procedure involves additional overhead and other disadvantages however it allows any executable file format to be packed the extraction to temporary file method has several disadvantages unmodified upx packing is often detected and unpacked by antivirus software scanners upx also has a built in feature for unpacking unmodified executables packed with itself upx does not currently support pe files containing cil code intended to run on the net framework

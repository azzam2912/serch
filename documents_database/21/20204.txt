developed originally to predict probability distributions of ore grades for mining operations it is currently applied in diverse disciplines including petroleum geology hydrogeology hydrology meteorology oceanography geochemistry geometallurgy geography forestry environmental control landscape ecology soil science and agriculture esp in precision farming geostatistics is applied in varied branches of geography particularly those involving the spread of diseases epidemiology the practice of commerce and military planning logistics and the development of efficient spatial networks geostatistical algorithms are incorporated in many places including geographic information systems gis and the r statistical environment geostatistics is intimately related to interpolation methods but extends far beyond simple interpolation problems geostatistical techniques rely on statistical models that are based on random function or random variable theory to model the uncertainty associated with spatial estimation and simulation a number of simpler interpolation methods algorithms such as inverse distance weighting bilinear interpolation and nearest neighbor interpolation were already well known before geostatistics geostatistics goes beyond the interpolation problem by considering the studied phenomenon at unknown locations as a set of correlated random variables let be the value of the variable of interest at a certain location this value is unknown e g temperature rainfall piezometric level geological facies

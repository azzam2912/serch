each instrument is based directly on the traditional violin and shares its acoustical properties with the goal of a richer and more homogeneous sound unlike the standard modern stringed instruments the main resonance of the body of the violin octet instrument is at a pitch near the two middle open strings giving the instruments a more balanced clearer sound the instruments were proposed by composer henry brant in 1957 and the first octet was completed in 1967 the instruments of the violin octet are note while the small bass and contrabass violins were designed and originally meant to be tuned in fifths most bassists find the required extra shifting impractical the new violin family association lists tunings for these instruments in fourths while the hutchins quartet retains the original fifths tuning carleen hutchins did not design specific bows for the instruments of the violin octet this is important research which still has not been completed players of these instruments use a variety of violin viola cello and double bass bows looking for the best fit they can at the moment currently there are three performing groups which play and record on the instruments of the violin octet the hutchins consort

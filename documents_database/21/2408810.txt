the virus is spread through saliva or urine and in healthy individuals can survive under the immune system control with any visible symptoms the cmv life strategy is to integrate dna into the genome of the host cells and escape the mechanism of natural immunity immune response against cmv is primarily provided by cd8 t cells which recognize viral fragments in mhc class i complex on the surface of infected cells and destroy these cells specific cd8 t cells are generated in secondary lymphoid organs where na ve t cells encounter with cytomegalovirus antigen on antigen presenting cells this results in a population of migrating effector cd8 t lymphocytes and the second small population called central memory t cells that remains in the secondary lymphatic organs and the bone marrow these cells are capable to respond and proliferate immediately after repeated pathogen recognition the amount of memory cells generated as a response to cytomegalovirus is approximately 9 1 10 2 of all circulating cd4 and cd8 memory cells generally these cells express a low level of node localization markers cd62l ccr7 and occur in peripheral organs they retain their standard functions like cytokine production and cytotoxicity they do not express

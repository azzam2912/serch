it is a modification of the aldol condensation a knoevenagel condensation is a nucleophilic addition of an active hydrogen compound to a carbonyl group followed by a dehydration reaction in which a molecule of water is eliminated hence condensation the product is often an unsaturated ketone a conjugated enone in this reaction the carbonyl group is an aldehyde or a ketone the catalyst is usually a weakly basic amine the active hydrogen component has the form where z is an electron withdrawing functional group z must be powerful enough to facilitate deprotonation to the enolate ion even with a mild base using a strong base in this reaction would induce self condensation of the aldehyde or ketone the hantzsch pyridine synthesis the gewald reaction and the feist benary furan synthesis all contain a knoevenagel reaction step the reaction also led to the discovery of cs gas with malonic compounds the reaction product can lose a molecule of carbon dioxide in a subsequent step in the so called doebner modification the base is pyridine for example the reaction product of acrolein and malonic acid in pyridine is trans 2 4 pentadienoic acid with one carboxylic acid group and not two a

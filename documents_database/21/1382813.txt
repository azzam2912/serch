the bre is a cis regulatory element that is found immediately near tata box and consists of 7 nucleotides there are two sets of bres one breu found immediately upstream of the tata box with the consensus ssrcgcc the other bred found around 7 nucleotides downstream with the consensus rtdkkkk the breu was discovered in 1998 by richard ebright and co workers the bred was named in 2005 by deng and roberts such a downstream recognition was reported earlier in 2000 in tsai and sigler s crystal structure the transcription factor ii b tfiib recognizes either bre and binds to it both bres work in conjunction with the tata box and tata box binding protein and have various effects on levels of transcription tfiib uses the cyclin like repeats to recognize dna the c terminal alpha helices of tfiib intercalate with the major groove of the dna at the breu the n terminal helices bind to the minor groove at bred tfiib is one part of the preinitiation complex that helps rna polymerase ii bind to the dna in addition to the human tfiib bre structure structures from many other organisms have been solved among those are transcription factor b

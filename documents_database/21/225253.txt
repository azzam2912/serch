galena is the principal ore and the most important compound of lead it is a semiconducting material with niche uses addition of hydrogen sulfide or sulfide salts to a solution containing a lead salt such as pbcl gives a black precipitate of lead sulfide this reaction is used in qualitative inorganic analysis the presence of hydrogen sulfide or sulfide ions may be tested using lead acetate paper like the related materials pbse and pbte pbs is a semiconductor in fact lead sulfide was one of the earliest materials to be used as a semiconductor lead sulfide crystallizes in the sodium chloride motif unlike many other iv vi semiconductors since pbs is the main ore of lead much effort has focused on its conversion a major process involves smelting of pbs followed by reduction of the resulting oxide idealized equations for these two steps are the sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfuric acid lead sulfide containing nanoparticle and quantum dots have been well studied traditionally such materials are produced by combining lead salts with a variety of sulfide sources pbs nanoparticles have been recently examined for use in solar cells although of little commercial value pbs is one of the oldest

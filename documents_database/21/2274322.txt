it is named after s p burke and t e w schumann who were able to predict the flame height and flame shape using their simple analysis of infinitely fast chemistry which is now called as burke schumann limit in 1928 at the first symposium on combustion consider a cylindrical duct with axis along formula 1 direction with radius formula 2 through which fuel is fed from the bottom and the tube mouth is located at formula 3 oxidizer is fed along the same axis but in the concentric tube of radius formula 4 outside the fuel tube let the mass fraction in the fuel tube be formula 5 and the mass fraction of the oxygen in the outside duct be formula 6 fuel and oxygen mixing occurs in the region formula 7 the following assumptions were made in the analysis consider a one step irreversible arrhenius law formula 11 where formula 12 is the mass of oxygen required to burn unit mass of fuel and formula 13 is the amount of heat released per unit mass of fuel burned if formula 14 is the number of moles of fuel burned per unit volume per unit time and introducing the

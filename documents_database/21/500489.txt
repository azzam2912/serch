the parameters of the energy functions may be derived from experiments in physics or chemistry calculations in quantum mechanics or both all atom force fields provide parameters for every type of atom in a system including hydrogen while united atom interatomic potentials treat the hydrogen and carbon atoms in each methyl group terminal methyl and each methylene bridge as one interaction center coarse grained potentials which are often used in long time simulations of macromolecules such as proteins nucleic acids and multi component complexes provide even cruder representations for higher computing efficiency the basic functional form of potential energy in molecular mechanics includes bonded terms for interactions of atoms that are linked by covalent bonds and nonbonded also termed noncovalent terms that describe the long range electrostatic and van der waals forces the specific decomposition of the terms depends on the force field but a general form for the total energy in an additive force field can be written as formula 1 where the components of the covalent and noncovalent contributions are given by the following summations formula 2 formula 3 the bond and angle terms are usually modeled by quadratic energy functions that do not allow bond breaking a

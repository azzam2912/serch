johannes brahms for example wrote his song of triumph op 55 in 1871 wagner already known for his musical patriotism in several of his operas hence composed the kaisermarsch which entailed both positive and negative reviews but did not succeed in attaining a more prominent status with regard to official ceremonies celebrating the newly achieved victory wagner wrote the text of the march did not become popular and is thus hardly sung when the imperial march is performed nowadays the main reason for this is the low quality of the text which emanates from the fact that it was written after the composition of the tune and did thus have to be trimmed in order to fit the melody another patriotic piece by wagner is hans sachs s final monologue in die meistersinger when he warns his fellow germans to protect german culture from foreign influence in the third act of lohengrin king henry praises the germans of brabant and their will to defend the empire against hungarian attacks

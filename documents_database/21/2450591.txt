this number is at its peak in early pregnancy but declines at parturition most studies of unks use murine cells to model the human equivalent unless stated otherwise this section focuses on murine unks only unks are large granular rounded or oval lymphocytes on microscopic examination they may have one or more cytoplasmic projections and or be binucleate characteristically they contain eosinophilic granules that stain darkly with pas indicating the presence of glycoproteins these granules usually appear regular but some can be irregularly shaped and they grow in size and number until approximately 2 weeks of gestation granules differ between species with rat unk cells displaying an increased number of small granules than murine cells rat unk morphology also differs from the mouse due to the common occurrence of myelin within the granules in all species as active cells they have numerous prominent organelles including mitochondria well developed golgi apparatus free ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum human unks share many of the surface receptors and proteins of circulating natural killer cnk cells exhibiting high levels of cd94 and cd56 however they possess a unique expression profile of certain proteins specifically cd9 cd103 an integrin and killer immunoglobulin like receptors kirs

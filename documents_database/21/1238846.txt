soil with a high shrink swell capacity is problematic and is known as shrink swell soil or expansive soil the amount of certain clay minerals that are present such as montmorillonite and smectite directly affects the shrink swell capacity of soil this ability to drastically change volume can cause damage to existing structures such as cracks in foundations or the walls of swimming pools due to the physical and chemical properties of some clays such as the lias group large swelling occurs when water is absorbed conversely when the water dries up these clays contract shrink the presence of these clay minerals is what allows soils to have the capacity to shrink and swell some of these clay minerals are smectite nontronite bentonite chlorite montmorillonite beidellite attapulgite illite and vermiculite the amount of these minerals in a particular soil will also determine the severity of the shrink swell capacity for instance soils with a small amount of expansive clay minerals will not expand as much when exposed to moisture as a soil with a large amount of the same clay minerals if a soil is composed of at least 5 percent of these clay minerals by weight it could have

this often mixes with dirt and other materials resulting in a gray or muddy brown color often solid ice or snow can block the drainage of fluid water from slushy areas so slush often goes through multiple freeze thaw cycles before completely disappearing in areas where road salt is used to clear roadways slush forms at lower temperatures than it would ordinarily in salted areas this can produce a number of different consistencies over the same geographical area because slush behaves like a non newtonian fluid which means it behaves like a solid mass until its inner shear forces rise beyond a specific threshold and beyond can very suddenly become fluid it is very difficult to predict its behavior this is the underlying mechanism of avalanches and their unpredictability and thus hidden potential to become a natural hazard slush can also be a problem on an aircraft runway since the effect of excess slush acting on the aircraft s wheels can have a resisting effect during take off which can cause an accident such as the munich air disaster slush on roads can also increase the braking distances for cars and trucks increasing the possibility of rear end crashes and

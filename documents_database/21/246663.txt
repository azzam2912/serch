using computer simulations artificial intelligence complex statistical methods and analytic approaches like social network analysis computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom up modeling of social interactions it involves the understanding of social agents the interaction among these agents and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence some of the approaches that originated in this field have been imported into the natural sciences such as measures of network centrality from the fields of social network analysis and network science in relevant literature computational sociology is often related to the study of social complexity social complexity concepts such as complex systems non linear interconnection among macro and micro process and emergence have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology a practical and well known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an artificial society by which researchers can analyze the structure of a social system in the past four decades computational sociology has been

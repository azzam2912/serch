it is located at a distance of circa 70 million light years from earth which given its apparent dimensions means that ngc 7531 is about 95 000 light years across it was discovered by john herschel on september 2 1836 the inner region of ngc 7531 is characterised by a high surface brightness ring the ring is a place of active star formation and a number of star clusters and hii regions have been identified in it the star formation rate of the inner ring is estimated to be 0 41 0 12 per year based on h alpha emission a weak bar is observed in the near infrared inside the ring along with dust lanes yet the motions at the inner ring are predominately circular the inner ring may lie at the location of the inner lindblad resonance the galaxy has two patchy spiral arms that are relatively well defined but are of low surface brightness hii regions have also been observed at the spiral arms of the galaxy where there is also active star formation which is more intense at the southwest region a supermassive black hole is believed to lie in the centre of the galaxy whose

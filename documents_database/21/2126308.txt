he is a developmental biologist and neuroscientist who is pioneering the generation of midbrain dopamine neurons for transplantation and clinical applications currently he is a member of the developmental biology program and department of neurosurgery at memorial sloan kettering cancer center and a professor of neuroscience at weill cornell medical college in new york city ny in 2015 he was named a recipient of the macarthur fellowship also known as the genius grant for his innovative work on stem cell and parkinson s disease research in 1998 while at the lab of ronald d mckay at the national institutes of health in bethesda maryland he developed techniques that facilitate the generation of dopamine cells the primary cell type affected in parkinson s disease in vitro from dividing precursor cells he successfully demonstrated that upon transplantation these newly developed dopaminergic neurons can improve clinical symptoms in parkinsonian rat models over the years he has developed a variety of novel cell engineering strategies for developing specific neural cell types in culture most notably he has devised protocols for the transition or differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into neural and neural crest tissues and for the generation of functional dopaminergic neurons in

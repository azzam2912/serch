they are combined with other equations governing physical laws to solve physical problems for example in fluid mechanics the flow of a fluid in a pipe in solid state physics the response of a crystal to an electric field or in structural analysis the connection between applied stresses or forces to strains or deformations some constitutive equations are simply phenomenological others are derived from first principles a common approximate constitutive equation frequently is expressed as a simple proportionality using a parameter taken to be a property of the material such as electrical conductivity or a spring constant however it is often necessary to account for the directional dependence of the material and the scalar parameter is generalized to a tensor constitutive relations are also modified to account for the rate of response of materials and their non linear behavior see the article linear response function the first constitutive equation constitutive law was developed by robert hooke and is known as hooke s law it deals with the case of linear elastic materials following this discovery this type of equation often called a stress strain relation in this example but also called a constitutive assumption or an equation of state was

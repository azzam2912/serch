the satisfactory value of a good work is its value with regard to making up for one s sins and reducing a person s stay in purgatory the term purgatory does not indicate a place but a condition of existence offering prayers for the dead is found in 2 maccabees 12 43 46 he then took up a collection among all his soldiers amounting to two thousand silver drachmas which he sent to jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice in doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way inasmuch as he had the resurrection of the dead in view for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again it would have been useless and foolish to pray for them in death but if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness it was a holy and pious thought thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be freed from this sin praying for the dead is among the spiritual works of mercy the souls in purgatory can do nothing for themselves they can no longer merit or give satisfaction or

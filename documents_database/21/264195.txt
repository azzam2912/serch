it was found that substoichimetric concentrations of cytochalasin b cb strongly inhibit network formation by actin filaments due to this it is often used in cytological research it inhibits cytoplasmic division by blocking the formation of contractile microfilaments it inhibits cell movement and induces nuclear extrusion cytochalasin b shortens actin filaments by blocking monomer addition at the fast growing end of polymers cytochalasin b inhibits glucose transport and platelet aggregation it blocks adenosine induced apoptotic body formation without affecting activation of endogenous adp ribosylation in leukemia hl 60 cells it is also used in cloning through nuclear transfer here enucleated recipient cells are treated with cytochalasin b cytochalasin b makes the cytoplasm of the oocytes more fluid and makes it possible to aspirate the nuclear genome of the oocyte within a small vesicle of plasma membrane into a micro needle thereby the oocyte genome is removed from the oocyte while preventing rupture of the plasma membrane this alkaloid is isolated from a fungus helminthosporium dematioideum cytochalasin b was first described in 1967 when it had been isolated from moulds by dr w b turner smith et al found that cb causes multinucleation in cells and significantly affects cell motility the

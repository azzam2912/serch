cellulose is a good insulator and is also polar having a dielectric constant significantly greater than one electrical paper products are classified by their thickness with tissue considered papers less than 1 5 mils 0 0381 mm thickness and board considered more than 20 mils 0 508 mm thickness the use of paper board as electrical insulation paper started in the early mid 20th century since the need for high voltage electrical transformers there has been a need for an insulating material that could withstand the high electrical and physical stresses experienced around a core and windings pressboard a board made by compressing layers of paper together and drying them has been used for installation purposes in many of the first electrical machines however as electrical technology increased the need for a higher density material that was capable of insulating larger and higher voltage transformers grew in the late 1920s hans tschudi faude became the director of h weidmann limited and began developing a type of pressboard that would meet the higher standards needed for the newer more powerful transformers unlike older methods of pressboard production transformerboard was not based on used paper or cotton waste but was made with

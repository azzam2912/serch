the cells of this region give rise to somites blocks of tissue running along both sides of the neural tube which form muscle and the tissues of the back including connective tissue and the dermis the paraxial and other regions of the mesoderm are thought to be specified by bone morphogenetic proteins or bmps along an axis spanning from the center to the sides of the body members of the fgf family also play an important role as does the wnt pathway in particular noggin a downstream target of the wnt pathway antagonizes bmp signaling forming boundaries where antagonists meet and limiting this signaling to a particular region of the mesoderm together these pathways provide the initial specification of the paraxial mesoderm and maintain this identity this specification process has now been fully recapitulated in vitro with the formation of paraxial mesoderm progenitors from pluripotent stem cells using a directed differentiation approach the tissue undergoes convergent extension as the primitive streak regresses or as the embryo gastrulates the notochord extends from the base of the head to the tail with it extend thick bands of paraxial mesoderm as the primitive streak continues to regress somites form from the paraxial mesoderm

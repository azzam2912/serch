it is designed for systems using the mapreduce framework the rcfile structure includes a data storage format data compression approach and optimization techniques for data reading it is able to meet all the four requirements of data placement 1 fast data loading 2 fast query processing 3 highly efficient storage space utilization and 4 a strong adaptivity to dynamic data access patterns rcfile is the result of research and collaborative efforts from facebook ohio state university and the institute of computing technology at the chinese academy of sciences a research paper on rcfile was published in 2011 the data placement structure and its implementation presented in the paper were widely adopted in the open source community big data analytics industries and application users for example a table in a database consists of 4 columns c1 to c4 to serialize the table rcfile partitions this table first horizontally and then vertically instead of only partitioning the table horizontally like the row oriented dbms row store the horizontal partitioning will first partition the table into multiple row groups based on the row group size which is a user specified value determining the size of each row group for example the table mentioned

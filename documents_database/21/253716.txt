it forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes from the genera medicago melilotus and trigonella including the model legume medicago truncatula this symbiosis results in a new plant organ termed a root nodule and is deemed symbiotic as it leaves excess nitrogen behind for the plant s meliloti are mobile and possess a cluster of peritrichous flagella the s meliloti genome contains four genes coding for flagellin these include flic1c2 flic3c4 the genome contains three replicons a chromosome 3 7 megabases a chromid psymb 1 7 megabases and a plasmid psyma 1 4 megabases individual strains may possess additional accessory plasmids five s meliloti genomes have been sequenced to date rm1021 ak83 bl225c rm41 and sm11 with 1021 considered to be the wild type nitrogen fixation by s meliloti is interfered with by the plastic modifier bisphenol a symbosis by s meliloti is conferred by genes residing on psyma once infiltrating the nodule the bacteria undergoes indeterminate nodulation with plants such as those in the genus medicago this is symbiotic relationship is not fully understood as it seems to be detrimental to the bacteria as once they are inside root nodules they become terminally differentiated into bacteroids and lose the ability

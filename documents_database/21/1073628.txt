it is a generalization to associative algebras of the notion of a separable field extension a ring homomorphism of unital but not necessarily commutative rings is called separable or a separable extension if the multiplication map admits a section by means of a homomorphism of a a bimodules such a section is determined by its value 1 the condition that is a section of is equivalent to and the condition to be an homomorphism of a a bimodules is equivalent to the following requirement for any a in a such an element p is called a separability idempotent since it satisfies formula 7 for any commutative ring r the non commutative ring of n by n matrices formula 8 is a separable r algebra for any formula 9 a separability idempotent is given by formula 10 where formula 11 denotes the elementary matrix which is 0 except for the entry in position i j which is 1 in particular this shows that separability idempotents need not be unique if formula 12 is a field extension then l is separable as an associative k algebra if and only if the extension of fields is separable if l k has a primitive

that is one must have for all x and y in the algebra every associative algebra is obviously alternative but so too are some strictly non associative algebras such as the octonions alternative algebras are so named because they are the algebras for which the associator is alternating the associator is a trilinear map given by by definition a multilinear map is alternating if it vanishes whenever two of its arguments are equal the left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent to both of these identities together imply that the associator is totally skew symmetric that is for any permutation it follows that for all x and y this is equivalent to the flexible identity the associator of an alternative algebra is therefore alternating conversely any algebra whose associator is alternating is clearly alternative by symmetry any algebra which satisfies any two of is alternative and therefore satisfies all three identities an alternating associator is always totally skew symmetric the converse holds so long as the characteristic of the base field is not 2 artin s theorem states that in an alternative algebra the subalgebra generated by any two elements is associative conversely any algebra for which

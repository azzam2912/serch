it involves using a beam of light usually ultraviolet light that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light typically but not necessarily visible light a complementary technique is absorption spectroscopy in the special case of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy intensity fluctuations from the emitted light are measured from either single fluorophores or pairs of fluorophores devices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers molecules have various states referred to as energy levels fluorescence spectroscopy is primarily concerned with electronic and vibrational states generally the species being examined has a ground electronic state a low energy state of interest and an excited electronic state of higher energy within each of these electronic states there are various vibrational states in fluorescence the species is first excited by absorbing a photon from its ground electronic state to one of the various vibrational states in the excited electronic state collisions with other molecules cause the excited molecule to lose vibrational energy until it reaches the lowest vibrational state from the excited electronic state this process is often visualized with a jablonski diagram the molecule then drops down to one of the various vibrational levels of the ground electronic

it is known for its large network within the los angeles county area based mainly on high school sites carrying cosmic ray detector units though there are also detector units on associated elementary schools and middle schools the chicos project represents a unique blending of cutting edge scientific research and broadly based educational outreach chicos is an active research array for the detection of ultra high energy cosmic ray the array as presently deployed has already seen extended air showers and the soon to be completed chicos 90 array will observe with large aperture in the energy range from 10 to 10 ev with the angular resolution to address questions of clustering in several years of run time the events chicos is designed to observe are single subatomic particles slamming into the earth s atmosphere with the energy of a brick falling from a rooftop these ultra high energy cosmic ray or uhecrs interact with the atmosphere to produce large showers of secondary particles at the surface of the earth detection of uhecrs therefore depends on an array of particle sensors deployed like a net over many square kilometers to catch the incoming shower in the chicos project schools across

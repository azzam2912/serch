the name was chosen as a tribute to galileo galilei who discovered the first four natural satellites of jupiter and later discovered that they could be used as a universal clock to obtain the longitude of a point on the earth s surface the giove satellites are operated by the giove mission giove m segment in the frame of the risk mitigation for the in orbit validation iov of the galileo positioning system these validation satellites were previously known as the galileo system testbed gstb version 2 gstb v2 in 2004 the galileo system test bed version 1 gstb v1 project validated the on ground algorithms for orbit determination and time synchronization od ts this project led by esa and european satellite navigation industries has provided industry with fundamental knowledge to develop the mission segment of the galileo positioning system giove satellites transmitted multifrequency ranging signals equivalent to the signals of future galileo l1bc l1a e6bc e6a e5a e5b the main purpose of the giove mission was to test and validate the reception and performance of novel code modulations designed for galileo including new signals based on the use of the boc binary offset carrier technique in particular the high

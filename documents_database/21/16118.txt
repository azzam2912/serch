a galvanometer works as an actuator by producing a rotary deflection of a pointer in response to electric current flowing through a coil in a constant magnetic field early galvanometers were not calibrated but their later developments were used as measuring instruments called ammeters to measure the current flowing through an electric circuit galvanometers developed from the observation that the needle of a magnetic compass is deflected near a wire that has electric current flowing through it first described by hans christian rsted in 1820 they were the first instruments used to detect and measure small amounts of electric currents andr marie amp re who gave mathematical expression to rsted s discovery and named the instrument after the italian electricity researcher luigi galvani who in 1791 discovered the principle of the frog galvanoscope that electric current would make the legs of a dead frog jerk sensitive galvanometers have been essential for the development of science and technology in many fields for example in the 1800s they enabled long range communication through submarine cables such as the earliest transatlantic telegraph cables and were essential to discovering the electrical activity of the heart and brain by their fine measurements of current galvanometers

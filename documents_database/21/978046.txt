fructokinase is in a family of enzymes called transferases meaning that this enzyme transfers functional groups it is also considered a phosphotransferase or frequently a kinase since it specifically transfers a phosphate group fructokinase specifically catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from atp the substrate to fructose as the initial step in its utilization the main role of fructokinase is in carbohydrate metabolism more specifically sucrose and fructose metabolism the reaction equation is as follows atp d fructose adp d fructose 1 phosphate fructokinase has been characterized from various organisms such as pea pisum sativum seeds avocado persera americana fruit and maize zea mays kernels and many more specifically fructokinase may also regulate starch synthesis in conjunction with ss sucrose synthase which first metabolizes sink tissue in plant tissues such as in potatoes there are also two divergent fructokinase genes that are differentially expressed and which also have different enzymatic properties such as those found in tomatoes in tomatoes fructokinase 1 frk 1 mrna is expressed at a constant level during fruit development however fructokinase 2 frk 2 mrna has a high expression level in young tomato fruit but then decreases during the later stages of fruit development frk

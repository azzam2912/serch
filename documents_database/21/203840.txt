the data is stored in a circular buffer based database thus the system storage footprint remains constant over time it also includes tools to extract round robin data in a graphical format for which it was originally intended bindings exist for several programming languages e g perl python ruby tcl php and lua there is an independent full java implementation called rrd4j rrdtool assumes time variable data in intervals of a certain length this interval usually named step is specified upon creation of an rrd file and cannot be changed afterwards because data may not always be available at just the right time rrdtool will automatically interpolate any submitted data to fit its internal time steps the value for a specific step that has been interpolated is named a primary data point pdp multiple pdps may be consolidated according to a consolidation function cf to form a consolidated data point cdp typical consolidation functions are average minimum maximum after the data has been consolidated the resulting cdp is stored in a round robin archive rra a round robin archive stores a fixed number of cdps and specifies how many pdps should be consolidated into one cdp and which cf to

polyomavirus capsids are composed of three proteins the major component is major capsid protein vp1 which self assembles into pentamers that in turn self assemble into enclosed icosahedral structures the minor components are vp2 and vp3 which bind in the interior of the capsid all three capsid proteins are expressed from alternative start sites on a single transcript of the late region of the circular viral chromosome so named because it is transcribed late in the process of viral infection the vp3 start site is in frame downstream from that of vp2 in consequence vp3 s sequence is identical to the c terminal portion of vp2 which has an additional n terminal extension in at least some polyomaviruses the vp2 n terminus is myristoylated some members of the polyomavirus family such as merkel cell polyomavirus do not appear to encode or express vp3 though vp2 is present both vp2 and vp3 are primarily intrinsically unstructured proteins they have dna binding domains and a nuclear localization signal at their c terminal ends both vp2 and vp3 bind to the interior of vp1 pentamers in the assembled capsid it is generally believed that the stoichiometry of this interaction is one molecule of

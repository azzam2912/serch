it was named in 1770 by explorer james cook after his own vessel hms endeavour and he used the strait as passage out to the indian ocean on his voyage the endeavour strait is approximately in length from its northernmost tip to its southern extremities and varies from in breadth the strait is on average between deep and its sandy floor is carpetted with a moderately thick layer of coral the strait is generally safe to travel through and is not littered with any major sunken dangers or foul ground although for larger vessels there is potential danger at the strait s western end at the point that it connects with the arafura sea where the depth of the water is only around the danger that this shallow western point presents was a barrier that the dutch explorers of australia never overcame in their earlier sea explorations of the region if they had been able to pass through the endeavour strait at the time it is likely they would have discovered eastern australia approximately one hundred and fifty years before the british did in 1770 as the dutch had been successful in mapping most of the west coast of australia

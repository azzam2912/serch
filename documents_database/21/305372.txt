this is usually done by help of stochastic asset models the advantage of monte carlo methods over other techniques increases as the dimensions sources of uncertainty of the problem increase monte carlo methods were first introduced to finance in 1964 by david b hertz through his harvard business review article discussing their application in corporate finance in 1977 phelim boyle pioneered the use of simulation in derivative valuation in his seminal journal of financial economics paper this article discusses typical financial problems in which monte carlo methods are used it also touches on the use of so called quasi random methods such as the use of sobol sequences the monte carlo method encompasses any technique of statistical sampling employed to approximate solutions to quantitative problems essentially the monte carlo method solves a problem by directly simulating the underlying physical process and then calculating the average result of the process this very general approach is valid in areas such as physics chemistry computer science etc in finance the monte carlo method is used to simulate the various sources of uncertainty that affect the value of the instrument portfolio or investment in question and to then calculate a representative value given these

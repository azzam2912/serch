momentum transfer is an important quantity because formula 4 is a better measure for the typical distance resolution of the reaction than the momenta themselves a wave has a momentum formula 5 and is a vectorial quantity the difference of the momentum of the scattered wave to the incident wave is called momentum transfer the wave number k is the absolute of the wave vector formula 6 and is related to the wavelength formula 7 often momentum transfer is given in wavenumber units in reciprocal length formula 8 the momentum transfer plays an important role in the evaluation of neutron x ray and electron diffraction for the investigation of condensed matter bragg diffraction occurs on the atomic crystal lattice conserves the wave energy and thus is called elastic scattering where the wave numbers final and incident particles formula 9 and formula 10 respectively are equal and just the direction changes by a reciprocal lattice vector formula 11 with the relation to the lattice spacing formula 12 as momentum is conserved the transfer of momentum occurs to crystal momentum the presentation in formula 13 space is generic and does not depend on the type of radiation and wavelength used but only

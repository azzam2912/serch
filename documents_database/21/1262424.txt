it is a pentavalent post transition metal and one of the pnictogens with chemical properties resembling its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony elemental bismuth may occur naturally although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores the free element is 86 as dense as lead it is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals bismuth was long considered the element with the highest atomic mass that is stable but in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive its only primordial isotope bismuth 209 decays via alpha decay with a half life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe because of its tremendously long half life bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes bismuth compounds account for about half the production of bismuth they are used in cosmetics pigments and a few pharmaceuticals notably bismuth subsalicylate used to treat diarrhea bismuth s unusual propensity to expand as it solidifies is responsible for some of its uses such as in casting

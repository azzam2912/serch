it contains an amino group which is in the protonated nh form under biological conditions an carboxylic acid group which is in the deprotonated coo form under biological conditions and a side chain pyrrolidine classifying it as a nonpolar at physiological ph aliphatic amino acid it is non essential in humans meaning the body can synthesize it from the non essential amino acid glutamate it is encoded by all the codons starting cc ccu ccc cca and ccg proline is the only proteinogenic amino acid with a secondary amine in that the alpha amino group is attached directly to the main chain making the carbon a direct substituent of the side chain proline was first isolated in 1900 by richard willst tter who obtained the amino acid while studying n methylproline the year after emil fischer published the synthesis of proline from phthalimide propylmalonic ester the name proline comes from pyrrolidine one of its constituents proline is biosynthetically derived from the amino acid glutamate glutamate 5 semialdehyde is first formed by glutamate 5 kinase atp dependent and glutamate 5 semialdehyde dehydrogenase which requires nadh or nadph this can then either spontaneously cyclize to form 1 pyrroline 5 carboxylic acid which

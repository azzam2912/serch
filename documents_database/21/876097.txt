it can automatically cluster small collections of documents e g search results or document abstracts into thematic categories apart from two specialized search results clustering algorithms carrot offers ready to use components for fetching search results from various sources carrot is written in java and distributed under the bsd license the initial version of carrot was implemented in 2001 by dawid weiss as part of his msc thesis to validate the applicability of the stc clustering algorithm to clustering search results in polish in 2003 a number of other search results clustering algorithms were added including lingo a novel text clustering algorithm designed specifically for clustering of search results while the source code of carrot was available since 2002 it was only in 2006 when version 1 0 was officially released in the same year version 2 0 was released with improved user interface and extended tool set in 2009 version 3 0 brought significant improvements in clustering quality simplified api and new gui application for tuning clustering based on the eclipse rich client platform the architecture of carrot is based on processing components arranged into pipelines two major groups or processing components in carrot are document sources and clustering

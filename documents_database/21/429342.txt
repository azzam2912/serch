these are called the thoracic intertransversarii and are supplied by the posterior rami of the spinal nerves in the lumbar region they are arranged in pairs on either side of the vertebral column the intertransversarii laterales are supplied by the anterior rami and the intertransversarii mediales by the posterior rami of the spinal nerves they contribute little to movement on their own but they stabilize adjoining vertebrae allowing more effective action from other muscle groups

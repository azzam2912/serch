aging refers to the extended heat treatment process these steels are a special class of low carbon ultra high strength steels that derive their strength not from carbon but from precipitation of intermetallic compounds the principal alloying element is 15 to 25 wt nickel secondary alloying elements which include cobalt molybdenum and titanium are added to produce intermetallic precipitates original development by bieber of inco in the late 1950s was carried out on 20 and 25 wt ni steels to which small additions of aluminium titanium and niobium were made a rise in the price of cobalt in the late 1970s led to the development of cobalt free maraging steels the common non stainless grades contain 17 19 wt nickel 8 12 wt cobalt 3 5 wt molybdenum and 0 2 1 6 wt titanium addition of chromium produces stainless grades resistant to corrosion this also indirectly increases hardenability as they require less nickel high chromium high nickel steels are generally austenitic and unable to transform to martensite when heat treated while lower nickel steels can transform to martensite alternative variants of nickel reduced maraging steels are based on alloys of iron and manganese plus minor additions of aluminium nickel

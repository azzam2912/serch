this planet was found by the transit method using the xo telescope and announced in may 2008 it was also independently discovered by the hatnet project the planet has a mass and radius just slightly larger than that of jupiter this planet orbits very close to the g type parent star as it is typical for transiting planets classing this as hot jupiter it takes only 4 188 days or 100 5 hours to orbit at an orbital distance of 0 0488 au xo 5b was the fifth hot jupiter transiting planet discovered by the xo project and was identified as a possible candidate extrasolar planet from two seasons of observations november 2003 to march 2004 and november 2004 to march 2005 follow up photometry was provided by the extended team a collaboration of professional and amateur astronomers the team obtained better quality light curves to guide the photometric and spectroscopic follow up necessary to classify a candidate as an actual planetary companion to confirm xo 5b s planetary nature radial velocity observations of xo 5 were made with the high resolution spectrograph on the 11 meter hobby eberly telescope located at mcdonald observatory in order to measure the mass

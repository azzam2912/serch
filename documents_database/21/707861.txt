the circumference formula 1 of a circle is related to its radius formula 2 by the formula formula 3 therefore the number of stitches formula 4 in a row at radius formula 2 must exactly equal that circumference times the stitch gauge if the medallion is to lie flat if the number of stitches is fewer than this the medallion will cup at its edges forming a spherical bowl if the number of stitches exceeds this the medallion will frill at its edges forming ruffles therefore one should measure the radius regularly as the medallion is being knitted and determine the number of stitches that need to be increased or decreased in each round rhese increases or decreases should be spread evenly around the circumference if the initial number of stitches were exactly correct and if every row were exactly the same height flat medallions could be ensured by increasing or decreasing the same number of stitches formula 6 in every row using the formula provided that formula 6 were exactly an integer this is impossible since formula 9 is irrational most medallion knitting patterns implicitly assume that this will work e g increase five stitches per round however the

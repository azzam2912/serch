such ideals are described more geometrically in terms of finite simplicial complexes the stanley reisner ring construction is a basic tool within algebraic combinatorics and combinatorial commutative algebra its properties were investigated by richard stanley melvin hochster and gerald reisner in the early 1970s given an abstract simplicial complex on the vertex set x x and a field k the corresponding stanley reisner ring or face ring denoted k is obtained from the polynomial ring k x x by quotienting out the ideal i generated by the square free monomials corresponding to the non faces of the ideal i is called the stanley reisner ideal or the face ideal of it is common to assume that every vertex x is a simplex in thus none of the variables belongs to the stanley reisner ideal i the face ring k is a multigraded algebra over k all of whose components with respect to the fine grading have dimension at most 1 consequently its homology can be studied by combinatorial and geometric methods an abstract simplicial complex is called cohen macaulay over k if its face ring is a cohen macaulay ring in his 1974 thesis gerald reisner gave a complete characterization

like many other human genetics disorders pnkd also refers to the disease the disease gene and the encoded protein pnkd is a protein that in humans is encoded by the pnkd gene alternative splicing results in the transcription of three isoforms the mouse ortholog is called brain protein 17 brp17 this gene is located on chromosome 2 at the band 2q35 and contains 12 exons at least three isoforms of varying lengths long medium and short can be produced by alternative splicing of this gene while the gene products of the long pnkd l and medium pnkd m isoforms contain the c terminal lactamase domain the short pnkd s isoform commonly referred to as myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 mr 1 contains only three exons and lacks homology to any known protein these isoforms also differ in their tissue specific expression and subcellular localization specifically pnkd l is only expressed in the central nervous system whereas pnkd m and pnkd s are ubiquitously expressed across tissues moreover pnkd l localizes to the cell membrane pnkd s to the cytoplasm and nucleus and pnkd m to the mitochondrion the function of pnkd proteins are unknown but the long and medium isoforms of pnkd

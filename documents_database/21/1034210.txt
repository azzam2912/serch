this heating system is the first of its kind in north america although much larger systems have been built in northern europe the 52 homes few variation of size and style with average above grade floor area of 145m in the community are heated with a solar district heating system that is charged with heat originating from solar collectors on the garage roofs and is enabled for year round heating by underground seasonal thermal energy storage stes the system was designed to model a way of addressing global warming and the burning of fossil fuels the solar energy is captured by 800 solar thermal collectors located on the roofs of all 52 houses garages it is billed as the first solar powered subdivision in north america although its electricity and transportation needs are provided by conventional sources in 2012 the installation achieved a world record solar fraction of 97 that is providing that amount of the community s heating requirements with solar energy over a one year time span in 2015 2016 season the installation achieved a solar fraction of 100 this was achieved by the borehole thermal storage system btes finally reaching high temperature after years of charging as

it is generally defined as the phosphorylation of the kinase by itself in eukaryotes this process occurs by the addition of a phosphate group to serine threonine or tyrosine residues within protein kinases normally to regulate the catalytic activity autophosphorylation may occur when a kinases own active site catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction cis autophosphorylation or when another kinase of the same type provides the active site that carries out the chemistry trans autophosphorylation the latter often occurs when kinase molecules dimerize in general the phosphate groups introduced are gamma phosphates from nucleoside triphosphates most commonly atp protein kinases many of which are regulated by autophosphorylation are vital in controlling the cellular proliferation differentiation metabolism migration and survival mutations in the genes encoding them or their potential activators or repressors can affect any number of functions within an organism phosphorylation is easily reversed by phosphatases therefore it is an effective method of turning on and off kinase activity because of this it is recognized as an essential process in cell signaling addition of a negatively charged phosphate group brings about a change in the microenvironment that may lead to attraction or repulsion of other residues or molecules the result may be

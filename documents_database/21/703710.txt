like indium antimonide aluminium antimonide and gallium antimonide it is a semiconducting intermetallic compound it is used in transistors infrared detectors and thermal imagers as well as magnetoresistive devices history of zinc antimony alloys and zinc antimonide the first reported use of zinc antimony alloys was in the original work of seebeck on thermoelectricity by the 1860s moses g farmer an american inventor had developed the first high powered thermoelectric generator based on using a zinc antimony alloy with a composition very close to stoichiometric znsb he showed this generator at the 1867 paris exposition where it was carefully studied and copied with minor modifications by a number of people including clamond farmer finally received the patent on his generator in 1870 george h cove patented a thermoelectric generator based on a zn sb alloy in the early 1900s his patent claimed that the voltage and current for six joints was 3v at 3a this was a far higher output than would be expected from a thermoelectric couple and was possibly the first demonstration of the thermophotovoltaic effect as the bandgap for znsb is 0 56ev which under ideal conditions could yield close to 0 5v per diode the next

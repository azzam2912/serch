although originally found in snake venom the activity of 5 nucleotidase has been described for bacteria and plant cells and is widely distributed in vertebrate tissue in mammalian cells the enzyme is predominantly located in the plasma membrane and its primary role is in the conversion of extracellular nucleotides e g 5 amp which are generally impermeable to the corresponding nucleoside e g adenosine which can readily enter most cells consequently the enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of nucleotides the enzyme has a wide substrate specificity for nucleotides and has been shown to hydrolyze 5 nucleotides rapidly ribose 5 phosphate slowly and other phosphate esters extremely slowly if at all for example the 5 nucleotidase enzyme catalyses the following chemical reactions the 5 nucleotidase catalyzed reaction of an amp nucleotide to adenosine nucleoside is shown below studies of the soluble form of human ecto 5 nucleotidase without a gpi anchor have shown that the c terminal domain holds the substrate binding pocket and that the aromatic purine motif of the substrate is stacked between two phenylalanine residues furthermore a catalytic mechanism has been proposed involving an in line nucleophilic attack by a hydroxyl moiety that is coordinated

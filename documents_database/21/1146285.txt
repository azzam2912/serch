the spacers are left in place for the pour to keep the reinforcing in place and become a permanent part of the structure the main categories of rebar spacers are rebar spacers can be divided in three raw materials categories the concrete spacers have the advantage of the same raw material which will improve the watertightness and strength of the concrete plastic spacers have the advantage of the low cost production and fast processing the engineering study of every reinforced concrete construction whether it is a building a bridge a bearing wall or other structure predicts the positioning of steel rebars at specific positions in the volume of concrete predicted concrete cover of steel reinforcement bars this cover typically varies between 10 and 100 mm the statics of every concrete construction are designed in such a way that steel and concrete properties are combined in order to achieve the maximum possible strength for the particular construction e g anti earthquake protection as well as to prevent the long term corrosion of steel that would weaken the construction rebar spacers secure the correct position of steel thus assisting in the practical application of the theoretical specifications of concrete construction the cover

the linewidth of a laser is a measure of its phase noise the spectrogram of a laser is produced by passing its light through a prism the spectrogram of the output of a pure noise free laser will consist of a single infinitely thin line if the laser exhibits phase noise the line will have non zero width the greater the phase noise the wider the line the same will be true with oscillators the spectrum of the output of a noise free oscillator has energy at each of the harmonics of the output signal but the bandwidth of each harmonic will be zero if the oscillator exhibits phase noise the harmonics will not have zero bandwidth the more phase noise the oscillator exhibits the wider the bandwidth of each harmonic phase noise is a noise in the phase of the signal consider the following noise free signal phase noise is added to this signal by adding a stochastic process represented by to the signal as follows if the phase noise in an oscillator stems from white noise sources then the power spectral density psd of the phase noise produced by an oscillator will be s f n f where

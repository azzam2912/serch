the terms of a trade are not finalized until a later date most often following the conclusion of the season postponing a trade s final conditions or terms is often done for several reasons first the team receiving the ptbnl might not be certain which position they want to fill so this type of deal gives them more time to figure it out second this type of arrangement gives the team receiving the ptbnl more time to evaluate the available talent on the other team also when a trade takes place during august a player must clear waivers before he can be traded the ptbnl concept allows the player s original team to make an attempt to have him clear waivers then finalize the deal or if the player cannot clear waivers wait until the end of the season to trade him when a ptbnl transaction occurs the negotiating teams usually agree on a list of five to ten players that the ptbnl will ultimately be chosen from the deal must close within six months of the conclusion of the rest of the trade if the teams can t agree on who the player will be then they will agree

due to the complexity of biological systems simplified models are often used which should only be as complex as necessary the aim of biosimulations is model based prediction of the behaviour and the dynamics of biological systems e g the response of an organ or a single cell towards a chemical however the quality of model based predictions strongly depends on the quality of the model which in turn is defined by the quality of the data and the profoundness of the knowledge biosimulation is becoming increasingly important for drug development since on average only 11 of all drug candidates are approved it is anticipated that biosimulation may be the tool to predict whether a candidate drug will fail in the development process e g in clinical trials due to adverse side effects bad pharmacokinetics or even toxicity the early prediction if a drug will fail in animals or humans would be a key to reduce both drug development costs and the amount of required animal experiments and clinical trials the latter is also in line with the so called 3rs which refer to the principle of reduction and replacement of animal experiments as well as to the refinement of

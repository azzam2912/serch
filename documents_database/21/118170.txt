in classical mechanics a symplectomorphism represents a transformation of phase space that is volume preserving and preserves the symplectic structure of phase space and is called a canonical transformation a diffeomorphism between two symplectic manifolds formula 1 is called a symplectomorphism if where formula 3 is the pullback of formula 4 the symplectic diffeomorphisms from formula 5 to formula 5 are a pseudo group called the symplectomorphism group see below the infinitesimal version of symplectomorphisms gives the symplectic vector fields a vector field formula 7 is called symplectic if also formula 9 is symplectic iff the flow formula 10 of formula 9 is a symplectomorphism for every formula 12 these vector fields build a lie subalgebra of formula 13 examples of symplectomorphisms include the canonical transformations of classical mechanics and theoretical physics the flow associated to any hamiltonian function the map on cotangent bundles induced by any diffeomorphism of manifolds and the coadjoint action of an element of a lie group on a coadjoint orbit any smooth function on a symplectic manifold gives rise by definition to a hamiltonian vector field and the set of all such form a subalgebra of the lie algebra of symplectic vector fields the integration

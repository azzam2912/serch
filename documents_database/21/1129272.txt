ampk is a heterotrimer consisting of an alpha catalytic subunit and non catalytic beta and gamma subunits ampk is an important energy sensing enzyme that monitors cellular energy status in response to cellular metabolic stresses ampk is activated and thus phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl coa carboxylase acc and beta hydroxy beta methylglutaryl coa reductase hmgcr key enzymes involved in regulating de novo biosynthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol this subunit may be a positive regulator of ampk activity the myristoylation and phosphorylation of this subunit have been shown to affect the enzyme activity and cellular localization of ampk this subunit may also serve as an adaptor molecule mediating the association of the ampk complex model organisms have been used in the study of prkab1 function a conditional knockout mouse line called prkab1 was generated as part of the international knockout mouse consortium program a high throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion twenty five tests were carried out on mutant mice and four significant abnormalities were observed homozygous mutant males displayed impaired glucose tolerance animals of both sex

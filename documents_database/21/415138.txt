such a structure can be defined by means of an atlas such that one can pass from chart to chart in it by piecewise linear functions this is slightly stronger than the topological notion of a triangulation an isomorphism of pl manifolds is called a pl homeomorphism pl or more precisely pdiff sits between diff the category of smooth manifolds and top the category of topological manifolds it is categorically better behaved than diff for example the generalized poincar conjecture is true in pl with the possible exception of dimension 4 where it is equivalent to diff but is false generally in diff but is worse behaved than top as elaborated in surgery theory smooth manifolds have canonical pl structures they are uniquely triangulizable by whitehead s theorem on triangulation but pl manifolds do not always have smooth structures they are not always smoothable this relation can be elaborated by introducing the category pdiff which contains both diff and pl and is equivalent to pl one way in which pl is better behaved than diff is that one can take cones in pl but not in diff the cone point is acceptable in pl a consequence is that the generalized

the observatory had been established in 1830 by colonel edward joshua cooper 1798 1863 as a private institution on his country estate cooper equipped it with excellent astronomical instruments graham proved an energetic observer at markree graham discovered the asteroid 9 metis from markree on 25 april 1848 while observing with a 3 inch aperture wide field telescope manufactured for comet searching by the german instrument maker ertel only eight minor planets were known before then with the first four having been found in the period 1801 1807 and graham s discovery consequently attracted considerable attention his mathematical abilities allowed him to compute the orbit of the minor planet and to predict its apparent position into the future including the gravitational effects of planets on its orbit around the sun graham later worked on the markree catalogue which consisted of observations of about sixty thousand stars along the ecliptic taken between 8 august 1848 and 27 march 1856 and was published in four volumes in the years 1851 1853 1854 and 1856 respectively whilst working on this he developed the square bar micrometer which greatly increased the efficiency of determining positions right ascension and declination of celestial objects graham calculated

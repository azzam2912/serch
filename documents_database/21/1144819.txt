these enzymes have also been referred to in the literature as acyl coa hydrolases acyl coa thioester hydrolases and palmitoyl coa hydrolases the reaction carried out by these enzymes is as follows coa ester ho free acid coenzyme a these enzymes use the same substrates as long chain acyl coa synthetases but have a unique purpose in that they generate the free acid and coa as opposed to long chain acyl coa synthetases which ligate fatty acids to coa to produce the coa ester the role of the acot family of enzymes is not well understood however it has been suggested that they play a crucial role in regulating the intracellular levels of coa esters coenzyme a and free fatty acids recent studies have shown that acyl coa esters have many more functions than simply an energy source these functions include allosteric regulation of enzymes such as acetyl coa carboxylase hexokinase iv and the citrate condensing enzyme long chain acyl coas also regulate opening of atp sensitive potassium channels and activation of calcium atpases thereby regulating insulin secretion a number of other cellular events are also mediated via acyl coas for example signal transduction through protein kinase c inhibition of

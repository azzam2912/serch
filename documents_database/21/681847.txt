proteins containing pdz domains play a key role in anchoring receptor proteins in the membrane to cytoskeletal components proteins with these domains help hold together and organize signaling complexes at cellular membranes these domains play a key role in the formation and function of signal transduction complexes pdz domains also play a highly significant role in the anchoring of cell surface receptors such as cftr and fzd7 to the actin cytoskeleton via mediators like nherf and ezrin pdz is an initialism combining the first letters of the first three proteins discovered to share the domain post synaptic density protein psd95 drosophila disc large tumor suppressor dlg1 and zonula occludens 1 protein zo 1 pdz domains have previously been referred to as dhr dlg homologous region or glgf glycine leucine glycine phenylalanine domains in general pdz domains bind to a short region of the c terminus of other specific proteins these short regions bind to the pdz domain by beta sheet augmentation this means that the beta sheet in the pdz domain is extended by the addition of a further beta strand from the tail of the binding partner protein the c terminal carboxylate group is bound by a nest protein

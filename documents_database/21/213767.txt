here space refers to the data storage consumed in performing a given task ram hdd etc and time refers to the time consumed in performing a given task computation time or response time the utility of a given space time tradeoff is affected by related fixed and variable costs of e g cpu speed storage space and is subject to diminishing returns biological usage of time memory tradeoffs can be seen in the earlier stages of animal behavior using stored knowledge or encoding stimuli reactions as instincts in the dna avoids the need for calculation in time critical situations more specific to computers look up tables have been implemented since the very earliest operating systems in 1980 martin hellman first proposed using a time memory tradeoff for cryptanalysis the most common situation is an algorithm involving a lookup table an implementation can include the entire table which reduces computing time but increases the amount of memory needed or it can compute table entries as needed increasing computing time but reducing memory requirements a space time tradeoff can be applied to the problem of data storage if data is stored uncompressed it takes more space but access takes less time than

the chain stretches from the northwest shore of mono lake to the south of mammoth mountain the mono lake volcanic field forms the northernmost part of the chain and consists of two volcanic islands in the lake and one cinder cone volcano on its northwest shore most of the mono craters which make up the bulk of the northern part of the mono inyo chain are phreatic steam explosion volcanoes that have since been either plugged or over topped by rhyolite domes and lava flows the inyo craters form much of the southern part of the chain and consist of phreatic explosion pits and rhyolitic lava flows and domes the southernmost part of the chain consists of fumaroles and explosion pits on mammoth mountain and a set of cinder cones south of the mountain the latter are called the red cones eruptions along the narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of long valley caldera 400 000 to 60 000 years ago mammoth mountain was formed during this period multiple eruptions from 40 000 to 600 years ago created the mono craters and eruptions 5 000 to 500 years ago formed the inyo craters lava flows

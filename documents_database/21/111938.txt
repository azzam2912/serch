this is a generalization of a riemannian manifold in which the requirement of positive definiteness is relaxed every tangent space of a pseudo riemannian manifold is a pseudo euclidean vector space a special case used in general relativity is a four dimensional lorentzian manifold for modeling spacetime where tangent vectors can be classified as timelike null and spacelike in differential geometry a differentiable manifold is a space which is locally similar to a euclidean space in an n dimensional euclidean space any point can be specified by n real numbers these are called the coordinates of the point an n dimensional differentiable manifold is a generalisation of n dimensional euclidean space in a manifold it may only be possible to define coordinates locally this is achieved by defining coordinate patches subsets of the manifold which can be mapped into n dimensional euclidean space see manifold differentiable manifold coordinate patch for more details associated with each point formula 1 in an formula 2 dimensional differentiable manifold formula 3 is a tangent space denoted formula 4 this is an formula 2 dimensional vector space whose elements can be thought of as equivalence classes of curves passing through the point formula 1 a

acting as a synergist to the trapezius the rhomboid major and minor elevate the medial border of the scapula medially and upward working in tandem with the levator scapulae muscle to rotate the scapulae downward while other shoulder muscles are active the rhomboid major and minor stabilize the scapula the nerve supply comes from the dorsal scapular nerve with most of its fibers derived from the c5 nerve root and only minor contribution from c4 or c6 the rhomboid minor gets its arterial blood supply from the dorsal scapular artery it is usually separated from the rhomboid major by a slight interval but the adjacent margins of the two muscles are occasionally united

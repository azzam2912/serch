such life traces can include footprints nests feces and coproliths scientists gain insight about the behavior and diversity of birds by studying such evidence ichnofossils or ichnites are especially important for clarifying the evolution and prehistoric diversity of taxa these cannot usually be associated with a particular genus let alone species of bird as hardly ever they are associated with fossil bones but it is possible to group them into ichnotaxa based on their morphology form in practice the details of shape that reveal the birds behavior or biologic affinity are generally given more weight in ichnologic classification these fossil traces of birds are sometimes hard to interpret correctly especially when they are from the mesozoic when the birds dinosaurian relatives were still in existence nests at least of neornithes are usually quite easy to identify as such due to the unique structures of their eggshells there is some uncertainty as regards the origin of certain mesozoic eggshells which makes nests of this age problematic mesozoic fossil footprints are hardest to attribute proto bird and related theropod feet were very much alike non avian theropod tracks such as the ichnogenus grallator were initially attributed to ratites because in the early

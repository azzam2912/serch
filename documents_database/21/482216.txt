due to the great force necessary to change the height of the boom while a boat is under sail a line based boom vang usually includes some sort of a pulley system hydraulic piston vangs are used on larger sailboats and controlled by manual or electric hydraulic pumps the term kicking strap is normally shortened to kicker whilst sailing e g hard on the kicker when we get to the leeward mark on some sailing boats such as the 49er rather than a set of lines pulling the boom downwards a rigid member is used to push the boom down by controlling leech tension the boom vang is one of the three methods of controlling sail twist on small sailboats and some cruising sailboats a vang may be omitted if a vang is not installed then the sheet has to try to control both horizontal and vertical angles of the boom when the boom is near the centerline the sheet is nearly vertical and can exert downward force on the boom as the sheet is loosened to increase the horizontal angle of the boom and sail the sheet becomes horizontal and exerts less downward force a vang works with the

the only difference is that the value of the energy is negative for the antiparticle the formal way to state this property is that the antiparticle scattering amplitudes are the analytic continuation of particle scattering amplitudes to negative energies the interpretation of this statement is that the antiparticle is in every way a particle going backwards in time murray gell mann and marvin leonard goldberger introduced crossing symmetry in 1954 crossing had already been implicit in the work of richard feynman but came to its own in the 1950s and 1960s as part of the analytic s matrix program consider an amplitude formula 10 we concentrate our attention on one of the incoming particles with momentum p the quantum field formula 11 corresponding to the particle is allowed to be either bosonic or fermionic crossing symmetry states that we can relate the amplitude of this process to the amplitude of a similar process with an outgoing antiparticle formula 12 replacing the incoming particle formula 11 formula 14 in the bosonic case the idea behind crossing symmetry can be understood intuitively using feynman diagrams consider any process involving an incoming particle with momentum p for the particle to give a measurable

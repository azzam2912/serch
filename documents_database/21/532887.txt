the polsten was designed to be simpler and much cheaper to build than the oerlikon without reducing effectiveness when nazi germany invaded poland in 1939 the polish design team escaped to england and resumed work together with czech and british designers the need for the polsten was apparently mooted in june 1941 it went into service in march 1944 alongside the oerlikon both the oerlikon and the polsten used similar 60 round drum magazines however the polsten could also use a simpler box magazine with 30 rounds it remained in service into the 1950s when compared to the oerlikon cannon which was made out of 250 parts the polsten was made out of 119 parts without sacrificing the effectiveness or the reliability of the cannon simplification of the design of the polsten cannon made its production much cheaper the cost of one oerlikon cannon was about 350 while the cost of the polsten was between 60 and 70 in january 1944 the 21st army group decided that only 20 mm polsten guns would be used as a standard light gun in order to simplify logistics the polsten was used as a substitute for the oerlikon in the same roles one

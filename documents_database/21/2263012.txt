a booster stage with solid fuel engines accelerates it to supersonic speeds after which a scramjet motor with liquid fuel deciling in the second stage accelerates it to hypersonic speeds the missile represents a further development of the hela hypersonic experimental flying vehicle developed by npo mashinostroyeniya that was on display at the 1995 maks air show the missile s range is estimated to be at low level and up to in a semi ballistic trajectory average range is around according to state owned media the longest possible range is and for this purpose a new fuel was created zircon can travel at a speed of such high speeds would likely create a cloud of plasma around the missile absorbing any radio waves and making the missile virtually invisible to radars plasma stealth this have led to concerns that it could penetrate existing naval defense systems zircon exchanges information in flight and can be controlled by commands if necessary zircon will be first deployed with the s admiral nakhimov and pyotr velikiy after 2020 the ships will have their p 700 granit anti ship missiles replaced with the 3s 14 universal vls cells capable of carrying the oniks kalibr and

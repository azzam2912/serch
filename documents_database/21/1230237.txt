brian mccabe in a landmark paper describing an autoimmune loss of hearing the disease results in progressive sensorineural hearing loss snhl that acts bilaterally and asymmetrically and sometimes affects an individual s vestibular system aied is used to describe any disorder in which the inner ear is damaged as a result of an autoimmune response some examples of autoimmune disorders that have presented with aied are cogan s syndrome relapsing polychondritis systemic lupus erythematosus granulomatosis with polyangiitis polyarteritis nodosa sjogren s syndrome and lyme disease research has come to the consensus that aied is the result of antibodies or other immune cells that cause damage to structures of the inner ear such as the cochlea and vestibular system of note aied is the only known snhl that responds to medical treatment but withholding treatment for longer than three months may result in permanent hearing loss and the need for cochlear implant installation although aied has been studied extensively over the past 25 years no clear mechanism of pathogenesis has emerged a recent paper performed a literature review of all relevant articles dating back to 1980 and proposed a mechanism of pathogenesis which includes an inflammatory response and immune cell attack

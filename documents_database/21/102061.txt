in mathematics higher order functions are also termed operators or functionals the differential operator in calculus is a common example since it maps a function to its derivative also a function higher order functions should not be confused with other uses of the word functor throughout mathematics see functor disambiguation in the untyped lambda calculus all functions are higher order in a typed lambda calculus from which most functional programming languages are derived higher order functions that take one function as argument are values with types of the form formula 1 the examples are not intended to compare and contrast programming languages but to serve as examples of higher order function syntax in the following examples the higher order function codice 3 takes a function and applies the function to some value twice if codice 3 has to be applied several times for the same codice 5 it preferably should return a function rather than a value this is in line with the don t repeat yourself principle explicitly let add3 x x 3 let twice f x f f x print int twice add3 7 13 one line print int fun f x f f x 3 7 13

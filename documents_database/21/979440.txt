it involved fitting or retrofitting partially water filled compartmentalized sponsons on either side of a ship s hull intended to detonate torpedoes absorb their explosions and contain flooding to damaged areas within the bulges essentially the bulge is a compartmentalized below the waterline sponson isolated from the ship s internal volume it is part air filled and part free flooding in theory a torpedo strike will rupture and flood the bulge s outer air filled component while the inner water filled part dissipates the shock and absorbs explosive fragments leaving the ship s main hull structurally intact transverse bulkheads within the bulge limit flooding to the damaged area of the structure the bulge was developed by the british director of naval construction eustace tennyson d eyncourt who had four old edgar class protected cruisers so fitted in 1914 these ships were used for shore bombardment duties and so were exposed to inshore submarine and torpedo boat attack grafton was torpedoed in 1917 and apart from a few minor splinter holes the damage was confined to the bulge and the ship safely made port edgar was hit in 1918 this time damage to the elderly hull was confined to dented plating

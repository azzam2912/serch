for example a square is fat because its length and width are identical a 2 by 1 rectangle is thinner than a square but it is fat relative to a 10 by 1 rectangle similarly a circle is fatter than a 1 by 10 ellipse and an equilateral triangle is fatter than a very obtuse triangle fat objects are especially important in computational geometry many algorithms in computational geometry can perform much better if their input consists of only fat objects see the applications section below given a constant r 1 an object o is called r fat if its slimness factor is at most r the slimness factor has different definitions in different papers a common definition is where o and the cubes are d dimensional a 2 dimensional cube is a square so the slimness factor of a square is 1 since its smallest enclosing square is the same as its largest enclosed disk the slimness factor of a 10 by 1 rectangle is 10 the slimness factor of a circle is 2 hence by this definition a square is 1 fat but a disk and a 10 1 rectangle are not 1 fat a square is also

like mosses and hornworts they have a gametophyte dominant life cycle in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information it is estimated that there are about 9000 species of liverworts some of the more familiar species grow as a flattened leafless thallus but most species are leafy with a form very much like a flattened moss leafy species can be distinguished from the apparently similar mosses on the basis of a number of features including their single celled rhizoids leafy liverworts also differ from most but not all mosses in that their leaves never have a costa present in many mosses and may bear marginal cilia very rare in mosses other differences are not universal for all mosses and liverworts but the occurrence of leaves arranged in three ranks the presence of deep lobes or segmented leaves or a lack of clearly differentiated stem and leaves all point to the plant being a liverwort liverworts are typically small usually from 2 20 mm wide with individual plants less than 10 cm long and are therefore often overlooked however certain species may cover large patches of ground rocks trees or any other reasonably firm substrate

dp and dp are encoded by two loci hla dpa1 and hla dpb1 that are found in the mhc class ii or hla d region in the human leukocyte antigen complex on human chromosome 6 see protein boxes on right for links less is known about hla dp relative to hla dq and hla dr but the sequencing of dp types and determination of more frequent haplotypes has progressed greatly within the last few years hla dp is an heterodimer cell surface receptor each dp subunit subunit subunit is composed of a helical n terminal domain an igg like sheet a membrane spanning domain and a cytoplasmic domain the helical domain forms the sides of the peptide binding groove the sheet regions form the base of the binding groove and the bulk of the molecule as well as the inter subunit non covalent binding region the name hla dp originally describes a transplantation antigen of mhc class ii category of the major histocompatibility complex of humans however this antigen is an artifact of the era of organ transplantation hla dp functions as a cell surface receptor for foreign or self antigens the immune system surveys antigens for foreign pathogens when

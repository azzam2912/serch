while a positive resistance consumes power from current passing through it a negative resistance produces power under certain conditions it can increase the power of an electrical signal amplifying it negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few nonlinear electronic components in a nonlinear device two types of resistance can be defined static or absolute resistance the ratio of voltage to current formula 1 and differential resistance the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current formula 2 the term negative resistance means negative differential resistance ndr formula 3 in general a negative differential resistance is a two terminal component which can amplify converting dc power applied to its terminals to ac output power to amplify an ac signal applied to the same terminals they are used in electronic oscillators and amplifiers particularly at microwave frequencies most microwave energy is produced with negative differential resistance devices they can also have hysteresis and be bistable and so are used in switching and memory circuits examples of devices with negative differential resistance are tunnel diodes gunn diodes and gas discharge tubes such as neon lamps and fluorescent lights in addition circuits containing amplifying devices such

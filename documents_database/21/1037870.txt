the systematic name of this enzyme class is s alkyl cysteine s oxide alkyl sulfenate lyase 2 aminoacrylate forming other names in common use include alliinase cysteine sulfoxide lyase alkylcysteine sulfoxide lyase s alkylcysteine sulfoxide lyase cysteine sulfoxide lyase s alkyl cysteine sulfoxide lyase and alliin alkyl sulfenate lyase it employs one cofactor pyridoxal phosphate many alliinases contain a novel n terminal epidermal growth factor like domain egf like domain these enzymes are found in plants of the genus allium such as garlic and onions alliinase is responsible for catalyzing chemical reactions that produce the volatile chemicals that give these foods their flavors odors and tear inducing properties alliinases are part of the plant s defense against herbivores alliinase is normally sequestered within a plant cell but when the plant is damaged by a feeding animal the alliinase is released to catalyze the production of the pungent chemicals this tends to have a deterrent effect on the animal the same reaction occurs when onion or garlic is cut with a knife in the kitchen in garlic an alliinase enzyme acts on the chemical alliin converting it into allicin the process involves two stages elimination of 2 propenesulfenic acid from the

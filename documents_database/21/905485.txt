the central goal of glodap is to generate a global climatology of the world ocean s carbon cycle for use in studies of both its natural and anthropogenically forced states glodap is funded by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the u s department of energy and the national science foundation the first glodap release v1 1 was produced from data collected during the 1990s by research cruises on the world ocean circulation experiment joint global ocean flux study and ocean atmosphere exchange study programmes the second glodap release v2 extended the first using data from cruises from 2000 2013 the data are available both as individual bottle data from sample sites and as interpolated fields on a standard longitude latitude depth grid the glodapv1 1 climatology contains analysed fields of present day 1990s dissolved inorganic carbon dic alkalinity carbon 14 c cfc 11 and cfc 12 the fields consist of three dimensional objectively analysed global grids at 1 horizontal resolution interpolated onto 33 standardised vertical intervals from the surface 0 m to the abyssal seafloor 5500 m in terms of temporal resolution the relative scarcity of the source data mean that unlike the world ocean atlas averaged fields are

causes of habitat fragmentation include geological processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment suspected of being one of the major causes of speciation and human activity such as land conversion which can alter the environment much faster and causes the extinction of many species the term habitat fragmentation includes five discrete phenomena fragmentation not only causes loss of the amount of habitat but by creating small isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat van den berg et al 2001 habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon and patch level process thus meaning it covers the patch areas edge effects and patch shape complexity in scientific literature there is some debate whether the term habitat fragmentation applies in cases of habitat loss or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area scientists who use the stricter definition of habitat fragmentation per se would refer to loss of habitat area as habitat loss and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat evidence of habitat destruction through natural

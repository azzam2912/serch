a tsf keeps the timers for all stations in the same basic service set bss synchronized all stations shall maintain a local tsf timer each mobile host maintains a tsf timer with modulus 2 counting in increments of microseconds the tsf is based on a 1 mhz clock and ticks in microseconds on a commercial level industry vendors assume the 802 11 tsf s synchronization to be within 25 microseconds timing synchronization is achieved by stations periodically exchanging timing information through beacon frames in infra bss the ap sends the tsf information in the beacons in independent basic service set ibss ad hoc each station competes to send the beacon each station maintains a tsf timer counting in increments of microseconds s stations adopt a received timing if it is later than the station s own tsf timer all stations in the ibss adopt a common value abeaconperiod that defines the length of beacon intervals or periods this value established by the station that initiates the ibss defines a series of target beacon transmission times tbtts exactly abeaconperiod time units apart time zero is defined to be a tbtt all stations in the ibss compete for beacon transmission every abeaconperiod

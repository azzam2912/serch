constructing cities changes the physical environment and alters energy moisture and motion regimes near the surface most of these alterations can be traced to causal factors such as air pollution anthropogenic sources of heat surface waterproofing thermal properties of the surface materials and morphology of the surface and its specific three dimensional geometry building spacing height orientation vegetative layering and the overall dimensions and geography of these elements other factors are relief proximity to water bodies size of the city population density and land use distributions several factors influence the urban climate including city size the morphology of the city land use configuration and the geographic setting such as relief elevation and regional climate some of the differences between urban and rural climates include air quality wind patterns and changes in rainfall patterns but one of the most studied is the urban heat island effect urban environments are typically warmer than their surroundings as documented over a century ago by howard urban areas are islands or spots on the broader scale compared with more rural surrounding land the spatial distribution of temperatures occurs in tandem with temporal changes which are both causally related to anthropogenic sources the urban environment has

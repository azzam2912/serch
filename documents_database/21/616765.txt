in fatty acid synthesis it has been reported to bind in equimolar ratio to b keto acyl acp synthase one of the seven moieties of fatty acid synthase blocking the interaction of malonyl coa it also has the related activity of stimulating fatty acid oxidation through the activation of cpt1 another enzyme normally inhibited by malonyl coa inhibition involves covalent thioacylation that permanently inactivates the enzymes these two behaviors may increase the availability of energy in the form of atp perhaps sensed by ampk in the hypothalamus in sterol synthesis cerulenin inhibits hmg coa synthetase activity it was also reported that cerulenin specifically inhibited fatty acid biosynthesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae without having an effect on sterol formation but in general conclusion cerulenin has inhibitory effects on sterol synthesis cerulenin causes a dose dependent decrease in her2 neu protein levels in breast cancer cells from 14 at 1 25 to 78 at 10 milligrams per liter and targeting of fatty acid synthase by related drugs has been suggested as a possible treatment antiproliferative and pro apoptotic effects have been shown in colon cells as well at an intraperitoneal dose of 30 milligrams per kilogram it has been shown to inhibit feeding

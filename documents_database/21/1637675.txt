kois come from a master list of 150 000 stars which itself is generated from the kepler input catalog kic a koi shows a periodic dimming indicative of an unseen planet passing between the star and earth eclipsing part of the star however such an observed dimming is not a guarantee of a transiting planet because other astronomical objects such as an eclipsing binary in the background can mimic a transit signal for this reason the majority of kois are as yet not confirmed transiting planet systems the first public release of a list of kois was on 15 june 2010 and contained 306 stars suspected of hosting exoplanets based on observations taken between 2 may 2009 and 16 september 2009 it was also announced that an additional 400 kois had been discovered but would not be immediately released to the public this was done in order for follow up observations to be performed by kepler team members on february 1 2011 a second release of observations made during the same time frame contained improved date reduction and listed 1235 transit signals around 997 stars stars observed by kepler that are considered candidates for transit events are given the designation

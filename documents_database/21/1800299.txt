it was originally developed by thine electronics inc in 2007 for high definition televisions but since 2010 v by one hs has been widely adopted in various markets such as document processing automotive infotainment systems industrial cameras and machine vision robotics and amusement equipments while high definition televisions had generally used lvds to transmit pixel data timing skew problems among conductors appeared by increasing data rate based on requirements of higher resolution and more color depth v by one hs by its serdes and cdr clock recovery technology achieves the high speed of 3 75 gbit s for each pair of conductors decreasing the number of conductors therefore reducing the total costs including cables and connectors this solves skew problems and reduces electromagnetic interference or emi and power consumption v by one hs is succeeded by v by one us which offers 4 times the data signaling rate per lane 16 gb s historically flat panel televisions used lvds as its internal interface to transmit pixel data but in accordance with televisions higher resolution and expansion in color depth televisions had to face problems such as increasing numbers of twisted pair cables and tangible skews problems among cables v by

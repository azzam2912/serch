the most original way of doing 3d content retrieval uses methods to add description text to 3d content files such as the content file name link text and the web page title so that related 3d content can be found through text retrieval because of the inefficiency of manually annotating 3d files researchers have investigated ways to automate the annotation process and provide a unified standard to create text descriptions for 3d contents moreover the increase in 3d content has demanded and inspired more advanced ways to retrieve 3d information thus shape matching methods for 3d content retrieval have become popular shape matching retrieval is based on techniques that compare and contrast similarities between 3d models derive a high level description e g a skeleton and then find matching results this method describes 3d models by using a skeleton the skeleton encodes the geometric and topological information in the form of a skeletal graph and uses graph matching techniques to match the skeletons and compare them however this method requires a 2 manifold input model and it is very sensitive to noise and details many of the existing 3d models are created for visualization purposes while missing the input quality

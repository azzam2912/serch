the term can be applied to a single switch or to an entire device a simple example of holding current is in a spark gap in the most basic of circuits if the current falls below the holding current even briefly the circuit is turned off becomes blocked however complex circuits and devices may have different delays built in between the time the current falls below this level and the time the device turns off whether a device turns on when current is restored is a design issue the current necessary to restore the circuit to the on state called the threshold current see threshold voltage may be much greater than the holding current or only very slightly more nevertheless where the device is designed to turn back on upon restoration of the current and where the device is running at or about the holding current level slight variations in the current can cause flicker as the device cycles off and on if flicker is undesirable it can be reduced by the use of capacitors or other circuits on the other hand flicker can be used to measure small events as in a geiger m ller tube a related term

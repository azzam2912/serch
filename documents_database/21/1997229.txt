both parts communicate with the surface of the body via a single opening called gonopore which is located on the ventral side of the posterior half of the body the male part of the reproductive system in planarians has a set of several testicles distributed throughout the body in two or more rows they are usually concentrated in the anterior two thirds of the body although they can reach close to the posterior end the testicles are connected to a pair of sperm ducts which run posteriorly towards the gonopore in some groups the sperm ducts met in their distal part forming the ejaculatory duct which then opens in a cavity called male atrium in others like land planarians both open in the prostatic vesicle a glandular organ which then runs posteriorly and opens in the male atrium usually through an ejaculatory duct the male atrium is located anteriorly to the gonopore usually associated to the ejaculatory duct there is a structure formed basically by a fold of the walls of the male atrium called penis papilla the penis papilla is a permanent structure that occupies part or the whole male atrium and is protruded during copulation thus also called

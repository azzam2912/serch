this gene is a dosage dependent transcription factor involved in the regulation of proper expression of other genes gbx2 expression occurs during gastrulation and continues to be expressed in the later stages of embryogenesis during these different stages gbx2 is responsible for several important processes in the neural plate stage gbx2 is required in order for the anterior hindbrain precursors to survive and form correctly also at this stage in development gbx2 is required for the proper regulation of different gene expression needed for the early establishment of a p patterning in the neural plate in the early stages of brain morphogenesis gbx2 is required for both the normal development of the anterior hindbrain and the proper formation of the mid hindbrain organizer because of the effects on the mid hindbrain organizer gbx2 is involved in the positioning of the expression domain for isthmic fgf8 since this is a dosage dependent gene the different amounts of gene present in certain location can cause different outcomes fgf8 is affected by the different dosages in the location it is expressed the absence of gbx2 causes fgf8 expression is shifted caudally and over expression of gbx2 causes fgf8 expression to be shifted rostrally

in addition to humans astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species and are classified as genus mammoastrovirus and from avian species such as ducks chickens and turkey poults classified as genus avastrovirus astroviruses are 28 35 nm diameter icosahedral viruses that have a characteristic five or sixpointed star like surface structure when viewed by electron microscopy along with the picornaviridae and the caliciviridae the astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus sense single stranded rna astrovirus has a non segmented single stranded positive sense rna genome within a non enveloped icosahedral capsid human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide members of a relatively new virus family the astroviridae astroviruses are now recognised as a cause of gastroenteritis in children whose immune systems are underdeveloped and elderly adults whose immune systems are generally somewhat compromised presence of viral particles in fecal matter and in epithelial intestinal cells indicate that the virus replicates in the gastrointestinal tract of humans the main symptoms are diarrhoea followed by nausea vomiting fever malaise and abdominal pain some research studies have shown that the

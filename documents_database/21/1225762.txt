these clouds are often ragged or wispy in appearance when caught in the outflow downdraft beneath a thunderstorm scud clouds will often move faster than the storm clouds themselves when in an inflow updraft area scud clouds tend to rise and may exhibit lateral movement ranging from very little to substantial pannus clouds are formed as the warmer and often more moist updraft of a thunderstorm lifts the relatively warm air near the surface these clouds condense as the warm moist air saturates through ascent and is pushed outward from the storm scud clouds are very commonly found on the leading edge of a storm front in this area of a storm scud are commonly associated with shelf clouds pannus clouds may also form when an updraft ingests precipitation cooled air from the downdraft scud forming in this region of the storm if moving laterally will tend to move inward towards the dominant updraft rising scud may condense and organize into a wall cloud pannus clouds can often be mistaken for a developing tornado landspout or waterspout the difference is determinable by observing the presence or absence of rotation not just movement of the scud clouds if rotation is present

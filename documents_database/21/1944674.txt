self gravity self gravitation has important effects in the fields of astronomy physics seismology geology and oceanography self gravity has important impacts in regard to the physical behavior on large scale planet size or larger objects such as the oceans on earth or the rings of saturn the equation to calculate the effects of self gravitation were made exact by lynden bell for the purpose of giving an exact description of models for rotating flattened globular clusters which was a crucial step in understanding how clusters of stars interact with each other self gravity deals with large scale observations in fields outside of astronomy as well self gravity does not typically appear as the central focus of scientific research but understanding it and being able to include its effects mathematically increases the accuracy of models and understanding large scale systems self gravity must be taken into account for astronomers because the bodies being dealt with are large enough to have gravitational effects on each other and within the bodies themselves self gravity affects bodies passing each other in space within the sphere defined by the roche limit because relatively small bodies could be torn apart by differential attraction but typically

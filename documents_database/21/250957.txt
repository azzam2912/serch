it is designed for performance scalability and integrity offering improvements over standard amiga filesystems as well as some special or unique features sfs uses block sizes ranging from 512 2 to 32768 2 bytes with a maximum partition size of 128 gb its good performance better than ffs and lack of need for long validation in case of an error is achieved by grouping multiple directory entries into a single block and by grouping meta data blocks together into clusters a bitmap is used to keep track of free space and file data is kept track of using extents arranged into a b tree structure integrity is maintained by keeping a transaction log of all changes made to metadata over a certain period of time the log is written to disk first into free space and then meta data blocks are overwritten directly should the system crash the next time the filesystem is mounted it will notice the uncompleted operation and roll it back to the last known consistent state for performance reasons only metadata integrity is ensured actual data in files can still be corrupted if a write operation is terminated halfway through unlike the original amiga filesystems ffs

in addition to the significance of his research on molecular biomarkers chemical fossils he was responsible for developing numerous experimental techniques that remain in widespread use one of the first researchers to illustrate the potential of coupled gas chromatography mass spectrometry in organic geochemistry eglinton also pioneered the use of infrared spectroscopy to characterise both inter and intra molecular hydrogen bonding these innovative techniques improved understanding of diverse aspects of the distribution stable isotopic content and provenance of organic compounds in the global environment eglinton was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1976 he won the royal medal in 1997 in recognition of his contribution to our understanding of the way in which chemicals move from the living biosphere to the fossil geosphere in particular the origin genesis maturation and migration of oil which has had great repercussions on the petroleum industry with john m hayes he was awarded the urey medal of the european association of geochemistry in 1997 in 2000 he received the v m goldschmidt award of the geochemical society he was awarded the wollaston medal in 2004 he was a co winner of the dan david prize in 2008 for his studies of

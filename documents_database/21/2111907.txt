microled displays consist of arrays of microscopic leds forming the individual pixel elements when compared with widespread lcd technology microled displays offer better contrast response times and energy efficiency along with oleds microleds are primarily aimed at small low energy devices such as smartwatches and smartphones oled and microled both offer greatly reduced energy requirements when compared to conventional lcd systems while also offering an infinite contrast ratio unlike oled microled is based on conventional gallium nitride gan led technology which offers far higher total brightness than oled produces as much as 30 times as well as higher efficiency in terms of lux w and thus lower power consumption than oled oled also suffers from screen burn in while microled does not but microled displays cannot be made flexible or transparent like oled displays can microled displays have not been mass produced though sony and samsung sell microled video walls and luumii mass produces microled lighting lg tianma playnitride tcl csot and plessey semiconductors ltd have demonstrated prototypes inorganic semiconductor microled led technology was first invented in 2000 by the research group of hongxing jiang and jingyu lin of texas tech university while they were at kansas state university following

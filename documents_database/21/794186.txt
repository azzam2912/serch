since both the voltage and the concentration gradients influence the movement of ions this process is a simplified version of electrodiffusion electrodiffusion is most accurately defined by the nernst planck equation and the ghk flux equation is a solution to the nernst planck equation with the assumptions listed below the american david e goldman of columbia university and the english nobel laureates alan lloyd hodgkin and bernard katz derived this equation several assumptions are made in deriving the ghk flux equation hille 2001 p 445 the ghk flux equation for an ion s hille 2001 p 445 where the reversal potential is shown to be contained in the ghk flux equation flax 2008 the proof is replicated from the reference flax 2008 here we wish to show that when the flux is zero the transmembrane potential is not zero formally it is written formula 3 which is equivalent to writing formula 4 which states that when the transmembrane potential is zero the flux is not zero however due to the form of the ghk flux equation when formula 5 formula 6 this is a problem as the value of formula 7 is indeterminate we turn to l h pital s

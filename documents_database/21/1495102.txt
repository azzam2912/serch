numerous measurements of stream discharge are made over a range of stream stages the rating curve is usually plotted as discharge on x axis versus stage surface elevation on y axis the development of a rating curve involves two steps in the first step the relationship between stage and discharge is established by measuring the stage and corresponding discharge in the river and in the second part stage of river is measured and discharge is calculated by using the relationship established in the first part stage is measured by reading a gauge installed in the river if the stage discharge relationship does not change with time it is called permanent control if the relationship does change it is called shifting control shifting control is usually due to erosion or deposition of sediment at the stage measurement site bedrock bottomed parts of rivers or concrete metal weirs or structures are often though not always permanent controls if g represents stage for discharge q then the relationship between g and q can possibly be approximated with an equation where formula 2 and formula 3 are rating curve constants and formula 4 is a constant which represents the gauge reading corresponding to zero

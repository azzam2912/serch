while many perform the same or similar biological roles some isoforms have unique functions a set of protein isoforms may be formed from alternative splicings variable promoter usage or other post transcriptional modifications of a single gene post translational modifications are generally not considered through rna splicing mechanisms mrna has the ability to select different protein coding segments exons of a gene or even different parts of exons from rna to form different mrna sequences each unique sequence produces a specific form of a protein the discovery of isoforms could explain the discrepancy between the small number of protein coding regions genes revealed by the human genome project and the large diversity of proteins seen in an organism different proteins encoded by the same gene could increase the diversity of the proteome isoforms at the rna level are readily characterized by cdna transcript studies many human genes possess confirmed alternative splicing isoforms it has been estimated that 100 000 expressed sequence tags ests can be identified in humans isoforms at the protein level can manifest in the deletion of whole domains or shorter loops usually located on the surface of the protein one single gene has the ability to produce

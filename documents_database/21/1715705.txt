its function is in osmoregulation responding to changes in environmental osmolality by regulating the expression of the outer membrane porins ompf and ompc envz is a histidine kinase which also possesses a cytoplasmic osmosensory domain and ompr is its corresponding response regulator protein envz is a sensor transmitter that spans the inner cytoplasmic membrane and has historically been divided into two domains the sensory and the transmitter domain the protein is composed of a short n terminal tail in the periplasm two transmembrane regions with an intervening periplasmic loop and a cytoplasmic domain containing the autophosphorylated histidine residue which is located in a dimeric four helix bundle variations in osmolality trigger conformational changes in envz which have been localized to the cytoplasmic four helix bundle and which effects phosphoryl transfer to ompr upon phosphorylation ompr becomes an active dimer that exhibits enhanced dna binding ability specific for both the ompc and ompf genes the signaling cascade can be elucidated as follows it is important to note that ompf and ompc are expressed at all times at constant levels however the individual porins ompf and ompc are present in various relative abundances based on medium osmolarity also the amount of ompf

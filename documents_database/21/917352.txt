it regulates neuronal morphology through cytoplasmic signaling and controlling gene expression the cdkl5 protein acts as a kinase which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms a phosphate group at specific positions researchers are currently working to determine which proteins are targeted by the cdkl5 protein cdkl5 deficiency had been thought of as a variant of rett s syndrome due to some similarities in the clinical presentation but it is now known to be an independent clinical entity caused by mutations in a distinct x linked gene and is considered separate to rett syndrome rather than a variant of it while cdkl5 is primarily associated with girls it has been seen in boys as well this disorder includes many of the features of classic rett syndrome including developmental problems loss of language skills and repeated hand wringing or hand washing movements but also causes recurrent seizures beginning in infancy some cdkl5 mutations change a single protein building block amino acid in a region of the cdkl5 protein that is critical for its kinase function other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short nonfunctional version of the

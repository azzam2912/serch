it was published from 1952 to 1959 and was edited by peter hamilton a young scot who was able to take advantage of spare capacity at his parents printing company crownpoint to launch the magazine because hamilton could only print nebula when crownpoint had no other work the schedule was initially erratic in 1955 he moved the printing to a dublin based firm and the schedule became a little more regular with a steady monthly run beginning in 1958 that lasted into the following year nebula s circulation was international with only a quarter of the sales in the united kingdom this led to disaster when south africa and australia imposed import controls on foreign periodicals at the end of the 1950s excise duties imposed in the uk added to hamilton s financial burdens and he was rapidly forced to close the magazine the last issue was dated june 1959 the magazine was popular with writers partly because hamilton went to great lengths to encourage new writers and partly because he paid better rates per word than much of his competition initially he could not compete with the american market but he offered a bonus for the most popular story

it is a generalization of ordinary graph coloring in a traditional graph coloring each vertex in a graph is assigned some color and adjacent vertices those connected by edges must be assigned different colors in a fractional coloring however a set of colors is assigned to each vertex of a graph the requirement about adjacent vertices still holds so if two vertices are joined by an edge they must have no colors in common fractional graph coloring can be viewed as the linear programming relaxation of traditional graph coloring indeed fractional coloring problems are much more amenable to a linear programming approach than traditional coloring problems a b fold coloring of a graph g is an assignment of sets of size b to vertices of a graph such that adjacent vertices receive disjoint sets an a b coloring is a b fold coloring out of a available colors equivalently it can be defined as a homomorphism to the kneser graph the b fold chromatic number g is the least a such that an a b coloring exists the fractional chromatic number g is defined to be note that the limit exists because g is subadditive meaning g g g the

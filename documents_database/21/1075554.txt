contrary to the word s implication a road s design speed is not necessarily its maximum safe speed that can be higher or lower the design speed chosen for a highway is a major factor in choosing superelevation rates and radii of curves sight distance and the lengths of crest and sag vertical curves roads with higher travel speeds require sweeping curves steeper curve banking longer sight distances and more gentle hill crests and valleys lower speed roads can have sharper curves less banking less sight distance and sharper hill crests and valleys while a road s design speed is sometimes used to determine an initial speed limit it is an imperfect measure of the maximum speed at which a motor vehicle can be operated for reasons including recognizing the limitations on the use of the design speed for speed limit determination operating speeds and even posted speed limits can be higher than design speeds without necessarily compromising safety the concept of design speed is evolving the definition in the 1994 edition of the aashto green book was the maximum safe speed that can be maintained over a specified section of highway when conditions are so favorable that the design

it results from interlacing wefts joining adjacent warp sections woven at different times successive rows of turnarounds of discontinuous wefts create a diagonal line which in pile rugs is best seen from the back side and from the front side only if the pile is heavily worn a lazy line is created when the weaver does not finish a rug line by line from one side to the other but sequentially finishes one area after the other section lines are frequently observed in antique oriental carpets especially in anatolian rugs of village or rural production as well as in traditional navajo weaving a smaller rug can be woven continuously by fitting in one line of pile knots around the longitudinal warp threads followed by the introduction of one or more threads of the weft or filling yarn which then span the entire width of the loom when working on a broader loom the weaver may decide to build up the area within easy reach first and then move sidewards and complete the rest the wefts are wound back around single warps at the borders of the respective area if the weft is always turned around the same warp a slit

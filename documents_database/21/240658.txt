in the business domain or domain of discourse in the relational model of data a natural key is a candidate key and is therefore a functional determinant for all attributes in a relation a natural key is sometimes called domain key a natural key serves two complementary purposes it provides a means of identification for data and it imposes a rule specifically a uniqueness constraint to ensure that data remains unique within an information system the uniqueness constraint assures uniqueness of data within a certain technical context e g a set of values in a table file or relation variable by rejecting input of any data that would otherwise violate the constraint this means that the user can rely on a guaranteed correspondence between facts identified by key values recorded in a system and the external domain of discourse a single version of the truth examples of natural keys could include the presence of a key guarantees uniqueness within an information system but it is not always necessary that the key values be unique or immutable within some wider population of objects or concepts outside that system for example a key on a city attribute means that the set of

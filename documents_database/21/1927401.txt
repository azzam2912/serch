it is readily isolated from soil and dung containing keratin rich tissues that have been separated from their animal hosts this organism distributed worldwide is most commonly found in areas of temperate climate in keeping with its optimal growth temperature of while a fulvescens is recognized as a geophilic fungal species it is also a facultative opportunistic pathogen although it is not a dermatophyte a fulvescens has occasionally been shown to cause onychomycosis infections in humans its recognition in the laboratory is clinically important for correct diagnosis and treatment of human dermal infections aphanoascus fulvescens has faced many discrepancies and challenges for proper taxonomic placement the naming and classification of a fulvescens has been subject to taxonomic confusion since the original discovery of the species the genus aphanoascus to which a fulvescens belongs was first described in 1890 by hugo zukal after isolating it from alligator dung in vienna zukal named this fungus aphanoascus cinnabarinus the same fungus however had already been isolated earlier in 1875 under the name badhamia fulvescens by cooke the genus aphanoascus was then further reviewed by apinis in 1968 who deemed a fulvescens as the type species while most mycologists accept this title others argue

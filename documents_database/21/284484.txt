the substrate of an electrophilic addition reaction must have a double bond or triple bond the driving force for this reaction is the formation of an electrophile x that forms a covalent bond with an electron rich unsaturated c c bond the positive charge on x is transferred to the carbon carbon bond forming a carbocation during the formation of the c x bond in step 2 of an electrophilic addition the positively charged intermediate combines with y that is electron rich and usually an anion to form the second covalent bond step 2 is the same nucleophilic attack process found in an s1 reaction the exact nature of the electrophile and the nature of the positively charged intermediate are not always clear and depend on reactants and reaction conditions in all asymmetric addition reactions to carbon regioselectivity is important and often determined by markovnikov s rule organoborane compounds give anti markovnikov additions electrophilic attack to an aromatic system results in electrophilic aromatic substitution rather than an addition reaction in electrophilic addition the electrophile with the positive charge effects the formation of the total structure which thus bears a positive charge as well to make up for the new addition

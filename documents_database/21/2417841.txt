it is mostly of interest for the study of infinite groups special cases of groups with finiteness properties are finitely generated and finitely presented groups given an integer formula 1 a group formula 2 is said to be of type f if there exists an aspherical cw complex whose fundamental group is isomorphic to formula 2 a classifying space for formula 2 and whose formula 5 skeleton is finite a group is said to be of type f if it is of type f for every formula 5 it is of type f if there exists a finite aspherical cw complex of which it is the fundamental group for small values of formula 5 these conditions have more classical interpretations it is known that for every formula 1 there are groups of type f which are not of type f finite groups are of type f but not of type f a reformulation of the f property is that a group has it if and only if it acts properly discontinuously freely and cocompactly on a cw complex whose homotopy groups formula 9 vanish another finiteness property can be formulated by replacing homotopy with homology a group is said to

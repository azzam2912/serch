memory storage and network connectivity of the virtual machine are transferred from the original guest machine to the destination two techniques for moving the virtual machine s memory state from the source to the destination are pre copy memory migration and post copy memory migration in pre copy memory migration the hypervisor typically copies all the memory pages from source to destination while the vm is still running on the source if some memory pages change become dirty during this process they will be re copied until the rate of re copied pages is greater than the page dirtying rate after the warm up phase the vm will be stopped on the original host the remaining dirty pages will be copied to the destination and the vm will be resumed on the destination host the time between stopping the vm on the original host and resuming it on destination is called down time and ranges from a few milliseconds to seconds according to the size of memory and applications running on the vm there are some techniques to reduce live migration down time such as using probability density function of memory change post copy vm migration is initiated by suspending

in physics temporal paradoxes fall into two broad groups consistency paradoxes exemplified by the grandfather paradox and causal loops other paradoxes associated with time travel are a variation of the fermi paradox and paradoxes of free will that stem from causal loops such as newcomb s paradox a causal loop is a paradox of time travel that occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event which in turn is the cause of the future event both events then exist in spacetime but their origin cannot be determined a causal loop may involve an event a person or object or information the terms boot strap paradox predestination paradox or ontological paradox are sometimes used in fiction to refer to a causal loop the consistency paradox or grandfather paradox occurs when the past is changed in any way thus creating a contradiction if one were ever to go back in time and kill one s grandfather in his childhood it would result in the time traveler s parents and ergo the time traveler not being born if the time traveler weren t born then he never went back in time to kill his grandfather in the first place

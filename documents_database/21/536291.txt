mdr was designed specifically to identify nonadditive interactions among discrete variables that influence a binary outcome and is considered a nonparametric and model free alternative to traditional statistical methods such as logistic regression the basis of the mdr method is a constructive induction or feature engineering algorithm that converts two or more variables or attributes to a single attribute this process of constructing a new attribute changes the representation space of the data the end goal is to create or discover a representation that facilitates the detection of nonlinear or nonadditive interactions among the attributes such that prediction of the class variable is improved over that of the original representation of the data consider the following simple example using the exclusive or xor function xor is a logical operator that is commonly used in data mining and machine learning as an example of a function that is not linearly separable the table below represents a simple dataset where the relationship between the attributes x1 and x2 and the class variable y is defined by the xor function such that y x1 xor x2 table 1 a machine learning algorithm would need to discover or approximate the xor function in order

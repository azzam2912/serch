it contains 9 whorls the 2 whorls of the protoconch are nearly smooth regular convex and chestnut colored the subsequent whorls are shouldered strongly convex in the middle but with a smooth concave band below the suture corresponding to the posterior notch in the outer lip the whorls are crossed below the subsutural band by about 16 strong prominent rounded somewhat oblique ribs most prominent on the middle of the whorl but not angulated on the body whorl these ribs become very oblique below the middle and follow the curve of the edge of the lip nearly fading out anteriorly the surface between the ribs is marked by faint growth lines and by fine unequal slightly raised revolving lines which pass over the ribs without interruption they become more evident on the lower part of the body whorl and are very faint on the subsutural band which is more decidedly marked by receding strongly curved growth lines the aperture is rather broad above elongated blow suboval the outer lip is very thin sharp prominent above separated from the preceding whorl by a wide and very deep sinus extending back for about one fifth of the circumference of the whorl the

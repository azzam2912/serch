the unification is based on there being four quark color charges dubbed red green blue and violet or lilac instead of the conventional three with the new violet quark being identified with the leptons the model also has left right symmetry and predicts the existence of a high energy right handed weak interaction with heavy w and z bosons originally the fourth color was labelled lilac to alliterate with lepton pati salam is a mainstream theory and a viable alternative to the georgi glashow unification it can be embedded within an unification model as can the pati salam model states that the gauge group is either or and the fermions form three families each consisting of the representations and this needs some explanation the center of is the in the quotient refers to the two element subgroup generated by the element of the center corresponding to the two element of and the 1 elements of and this includes the right handed neutrino which is now likely believed to exist see neutrino oscillations there is also a and or a scalar field called the higgs field which acquires a vev this results in a spontaneous symmetry breaking from to or from

it is composed primarily of water with small amounts of minerals salts ions nutrients and proteins in solution in whole blood red blood cells leukocytes and platelets are suspended within the plasma plasma contains a large variety of proteins including albumin immunoglobulins and clotting proteins such as fibrinogen albumin constitutes about 60 of the total protein in plasma and is present at concentrations between 35 and 55 mg ml it is the main contributor to osmotic pressure of the blood and it functions as a carrier molecule for molecules with low water solubility such as lipid soluble hormones enzymes fatty acids metal ions and pharmaceutical compounds albumin is structurally stable due to its seventeen disulfide bonds and unique in that it has the highest water solubility and the lowest isoelectric point pi of the plasma proteins due to the structural integrity of albumin it remains stable under conditions where most other proteins denature many of the proteins in plasma have important therapeutic uses albumin is commonly used to replenish and maintain blood volume after traumatic injury during surgery and during plasma exchange since albumin is the most abundant protein in the plasma its use may be the most well known

the contarini rosselli map was designed by giovanni matteo contarini and engraved by francesco rosselli it is a copper engraved map and was published in venice or florence in 1506 the only surviving copy is in the british library there had been many voyages of discovery in the immediately preceding years although there had been maps created after these voyages such as juan de la cosa s map of the world in 1500 based on columbus second voyage and the cantino world map circa 1502 the information on these maps was closely guarded these maps were commissioned by the portuguese and spanish governments which wanted to create trade monopolies over the regions they depicted the royal powers worried that leaked information about geography could make it easier for other nations to challenge their supremacy often a limited number of copies was made to be held under lock and key this situation changed drastically from 1506 to 1507 when three separate efforts to produce world maps were published the contarini rosselli map of 1506 now in the british library and martin waldseem ller s map of the world and globe of 1507 were influential but not very widely published there is

the term is also sometimes used in a similar way to describe the shell of a cephalopod mollusk in gastropods the body whorl or last whorl is the most recently formed and largest whorl or revolution of a spiral or helical shell terminating in the aperture it is called the body whorl because most of the body of the soft parts of the animal fits into this whorl the proportional size of the body whorl in gastropod shells differs greatly according to the actual shell morphology for shells in which the rate of whorl expansion of each revolution around the axis is very high the aperture and the body whorl are large and the shell tends to be low spired the shell of the abalone is a good example of this kind of shell the opposite tendency can sometimes create a high spire with very little whorl increase per revolution in these instances e g in the shell of turritella species both the body whorl and the aperture are relatively small in mollusc shells where there is no elevation at all to the spire and only moderate whorl expansion the body whorl can sometimes still represent a large part of

the gene product contains a coiled coil domain that interacts with stathmin a cytosolic phosphoprotein implicated in tumorigenesis the protein may play a role in cell growth and differentiation and act as a negative growth regulator in vitro steady state expression of this tumor susceptibility gene appears to be important for maintenance of genomic stability and cell cycle regulation mutations and alternative splicing in this gene occur in high frequency in breast cancer and suggest that defects occur during breast cancer tumorigenesis and or progression the main role of escrt i is to recognise ubiquitinated cargo via the uev protein domain of the vps23 tsg101 subunit the assembly of the escrt i complex is directed by the c terminal steadiness box sb of vps23 the n terminal half of vps28 and the c terminal half of vps37 the structure is primarily composed of three long parallel helical hairpins each corresponding to a different subunit the additional domains and motifs extending beyond the core serve as gripping tools for escrt i critical functions tsg101 seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of hiv in uninfected cells tsg101 functions in the biogenesis of the multivesicular body mvb which suggests that

it is particularly common in birds but there are examples of this occurrence in reptiles invertebrates fish amphibians and mammals social monogamy in mammals is defined as a long term or sequential living arrangement between an adult male and an adult female heterogeneous pair it should not be confused with genetic monogamy which refers to two individuals who only reproduce with one another social monogamy does not describe the sexual interactions or patterns of reproduction between monogamous pairs rather it strictly refers to the patterns of their living conditions this arrangement consists of but is not limited to sharing the same territory obtaining food resources and raising offspring together a unique characteristic of monogamy is that unlike in polygamous species parents share parenting tasks even though their tasks are shared monogamy does not define the degree of paternal investment in the breeding of the young only 3 5 of all mammalian species are socially monogamous including some species that mate for life and ones that mate for an extended period of time lifelong monogamy is very rare however it is exemplified by species such as the prairie vole microtus ochrogaster a vast majority of monogamous mammals practice sequential social monogamy

it is used in certain macroeconomic models formally where formula 2 is the vector of lagged factors of the variables in the formula 3 matrix formula 4 t is the number of observations and n is the number of variables formula 5 are the factor loadings and formula 6 is the factor error diffusion indexes were originally designed to help identify business cycle turning points a diffusion index of monthly employment levels across industries measures the degree to which a growth in employment levels in a population is made up of growth in all industries versus sharp growth in just a few industries in one published data series on that design the diffusion index is computed from a panel of discrete time series by assigning a value of 0 to an observation if it is lower than its analog in the previous month 50 if it is at the same level and 100 if it has increased the average of these component values for a given period over the time period is a diffusion index relative to the equation above the underlying factors formula 7 are drawn from the values 0 50 100 based on employment changes and the diffusion

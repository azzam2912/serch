1 it can be due to interaction between electrostatic fields and net charge or electric polarization effects the beam like structure element is generally cantilevered fix at one of its ends in nanomaterials carbon nanotubes cnts are typical ones for electrostatic deflections mechanisms of electric deflection due to electric polarization can be understood as follows as shown in fig 2 when a material is brought into an electric field e the field tends to shift the positive charge in red and the negative charge in blue in opposite directions thus induced dipoles are created fig 3 shows a beam like structure element in an electric field the interaction between the molecular dipole moment and the electric field results an induced torque t then this torque tends to align the beam toward the direction of field in case of a cantilevered cnt fig 1 it would be bent to the field direction meanwhile the electrically induced torque and stiffness of the cnt compete against each other this deformation has been observed in experiments this property is an important characteristic for cnts promising nanoelectromechanical systems applications as well as for their fabrication separation and electromanipulation recently several nanoelectromechanical systems based on cantilevered

first proposed by george hammond in 1955 the postulate states that if two states as for example a transition state and an unstable intermediate occur consecutively during a reaction process and have nearly the same energy content their interconversion will involve only a small reorganization of the molecular structures therefore the geometric structure of a state can be predicted by comparing its energy to the species neighboring it along the reaction coordinate for example in an exothermic reaction the transition state is closer in energy to the reactants than to the products therefore the transition state will be more geometrically similar to the reactants than to the products in contrast however in an endothermic reaction the transition state is closer in energy to the products than to the reactants so according to hammond s postulate the structure of the transition state would resemble the products more than the reactants this type of comparison is especially useful because most transition states cannot be characterized experimentally hammond s postulate also helps to explain and rationalize the bell evans polanyi principle namely this principle describes the experimental observation that the rate of a reaction and therefore its activation energy is affected by the

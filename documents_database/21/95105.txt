settling and anaerobic processes reduce solids and organics but the treatment efficiency is only moderate referred to as primary treatment septic tank systems are a type of simple onsite sewage facility ossf they can be used in areas that are not connected to a sewerage system such as rural areas the treated liquid effluent is commonly disposed in a septic drain field which provides further treatment nonetheless groundwater pollution may occur and can be a problem the term septic refers to the anaerobic bacterial environment that develops in the tank that decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank septic tanks can be coupled with other onsite wastewater treatment units such as biofilters or aerobic systems involving artificially forced aeration the rate of accumulation of sludge also called septage or fecal sludge is faster than the rate of decomposition therefore the accumulated fecal sludge must be periodically removed which is commonly done with a vacuum truck a septic tank consists of one or more concrete or plastic tanks of between 4000 and 7500 liters 1 000 and 2 000 gallons one end is connected to an inlet wastewater pipe and the other to a septic drain field generally these

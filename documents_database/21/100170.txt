the movement or displacement of such mobile defects is thermally activated and thus limited by the rate of atomic diffusion deformation is often described as strain the concept of deformation is also linked to the study of the stability of an elastic material by using the method of incremental deformations based on a superposed small deformation on an equilibrium solution as deformation occurs internal inter molecular forces arise that oppose the applied force if the applied force is not too great these forces may be sufficient to completely resist the applied force and allow the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original state when the load is removed a larger applied force may lead to a permanent deformation of the object or even to its structural failure in the figure it can be seen that the compressive loading indicated by the arrow has caused deformation in the cylinder so that the original shape dashed lines has changed deformed into one with bulging sides the sides bulge because the material although strong enough to not crack or otherwise fail is not strong enough to support the load without change as a result the material is

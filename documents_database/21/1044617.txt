the following three conditions are necessary for formula 1 to have the desired prime producing property bunyakovsky s conjecture is that these conditions are sufficient if formula 1 satisfies 1 3 then formula 7 is prime for infinitely many positive integers formula 8 we need the first condition because if the leading coefficient is negative then formula 9 for all large formula 10 and thus formula 7 is not a positive prime number for large positive integers formula 8 this merely satisfies the sign convention that primes are positive we need the second condition because if formula 13 where the polynomials formula 14 and formula 15 have integer coefficients then we have formula 16 for all integers formula 8 but formula 14 and formula 15 take the values 0 and formula 20 only finitely many times so formula 7 is composite for all large formula 8 the third condition that the numbers formula 7 have gcd 1 is obviously necessary but is somewhat subtle and is best understood by a counterexample consider formula 24 which has positive leading coefficient and is irreducible and the coefficients are relatively prime however formula 7 is even for all integers formula 8 and so

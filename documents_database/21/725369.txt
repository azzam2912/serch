if the finite projective plane has order q there are q 1 points on any line then for a maximal arc k the number of points of the arc is the maximum possible qd d q with the property that no d 1 points of the arc lie on the same line let formula 1 be a finite projective plane of order q not necessarily desarguesian maximal arcs of degree d 2 d q 1 are k d arcs in formula 1 where k is maximal with respect to the parameter d in other words k qd d q equivalently one can define maximal arcs of degree d in formula 1 as non empty sets of points k such that every line intersects the set either in 0 or d points some authors permit the degree of a maximal arc to be 1 q or even q 1 letting k be a maximal k d arc in a projective plane of order q if all of these cases are considered to be trivial examples of maximal arcs existing in any type of projective plane for any value of q when 2 d q 1 the maximal arc is called non

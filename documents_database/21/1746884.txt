not all logical consequences are tautological consequences a proposition formula 1 is said to be a tautological consequence of one or more other propositions formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 in a proof with respect to some logical system if one is validly able to introduce the proposition onto a line of the proof within the rules of the system and in all cases when each of those one or more other propositions formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 are true the proposition formula 1 also is true another way to express this preservation of tautologousness is by using truth tables a proposition formula 1 is said to be a tautological consequence of one or more other propositions formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 if and only if in every row of a joint truth table that assigns t to all propositions formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 the truth table also assigns t to formula 1 socrates is a man the conclusion of this argument is a logical consequence of the premises because it is impossible for all the premises to be true while the conclusion false reviewing the truth table it turns out the conclusion of the argument

though the song was never released as a single the song is very popular among cooper s fans often favourite above all others by some guitar player joe satriani makes a guest appearance on the track the track is the first confirmed appearance of fictional character alter ego steven in more than 15 years in the song we learn that he is imprisoned in a lunatic hospital and that his only friends are the insects rats and his toys on the floor this tells us that he still has the mind of a small child obviously it upset steven to become an adult the song possibly suggests something happened that forced him to be like an adult before he was ready for it it might be that his parents rejected him steven feels that he never had the chance to be a young boy and that he grew up too fast because of this he acts like a child and probably thinks that he still is one it is also hinted that steven still is haunted by the nightmare from cooper s 1975 album welcome to my nightmare and possibly also the curator from the album after the song ends

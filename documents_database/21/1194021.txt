it was a national historic landmark the tunnel was completed in 1936 at a cost of 36 266 000 because of its high speed and bernoulli s principle the pressure in the test section is much lower than that in the rest of the tunnel this required a structure that could withstand an inward force due to the pressure difference instead of steel construction it was built from reinforced concrete with walls up to 1 ft 0 3 m thick this resulted in an igloo like structure at the test section the wind tunnel was designed as a single return tunnel capable of moving air at speeds up to a mach number up to 0 75 it was powered by an electric motor it was repowered to to give mach number 1 capability in 1945 in 1947 the speed was increased to a mach number of 1 2 with the installation of a contoured nozzle in 1950 a slotted throat test section was installed and it was repowered to because it was the first continuous flow high speed tunnel this tunnel was a landmark in wind tunnel design this meant it could operate almost indefinitely to produce a high speed

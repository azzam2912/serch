it is most generally applied to a pollinator attempting to copulate with a flower some flowers mimic a potential female mate visually but the key stimuli are often chemical and tactile this form of mimicry in plants is called pouyannian mimicry orchids commonly achieve reproduction in this manner secreting chemicals from glands osmophores in the sepals petals or labellum that are indistinguishable from the insect s natural pheromones the pollinator then has a pollinium attached to its body which it transfers to the stigma of another flower when it attempts another copulation pollinators are often bees and wasps of the order hymenoptera and flies the cost to the pollinating insects might be seen as negligible but study of cryptostylis an australian orchid pollinators shows that they may waste large amounts of sperm by ejaculating onto the flower thus there could be antagonistic coevolution such that pollinators become better at identifying their own species correctly and orchids become better mimics pseudocopulation is also used to describe close physical contact between mating animals which have their eggs externally fertilized frogs provide one such case with the male releasing sperm as the female discharges her eggs a process called amplexus in some species

in photography a light meter is often used to determine the proper exposure for a photograph typically a light meter will include either digital or analog electronic circuit which allows the photographer to determine which shutter speed and f number should be selected for an optimum exposure given a certain lighting situation and film speed light meters are also used in the fields of cinematography and scenic design in order to determine the optimum light level for a scene they are used in the general field of architectural lighting design to verify proper installation and performance of a building lighting system and in assessing the light levels for growing plants the earliest type of light meters were called extinction meters and contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density the photographer would position the meter in front of his subject and note the filter with the greatest density that still allowed incident light to pass through the letter or number corresponding to the filter was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed extinction meters suffered from the problem that they depended on the

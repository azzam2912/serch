they are considered early primitive ungulates it is now largely considered to be a wastebasket taxon having served as a dumping ground for classifying ungulates which had not been clearly established as part of either perissodactyla or cetartiodactyla being composed thus of several unrelated lineages condylarthra always was a problematic group when condylarthra was first described by phenacodontidae was the type and only family therein however raised condylarthra to an order and included a wide range of diverse placentals with generalized dentitions and postcranial skeletons more recent researchers i e post ww2 have been more restrictive either including only a limited number of taxa or proposing that the term should be abandoned altogether due to their primitive characteristics condylarths have been considered ancestral to several ungulate orders including the living artiodactyla cetacea perissodactyla hyracoidea sirenia and proboscidea as well as the extinct desmostylia embrithopoda litopterna notoungulata and astrapotheria the disappearance of the dinosaurs opened up an ecological niche for large mammalian herbivores some condylarths evolved to fill the niche while others remained insectivorous this may explain in part the tremendous evolutionary radiation of the condylarths that we can observe throughout the paleocene resulting in the different groups of ungulates or

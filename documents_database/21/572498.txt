it was firstly synthesised by charles lauth a variety of salts are known including the chloride and acetate called respectively thionine chloride and thionine acetate the dye is structurally related to methylene blue which also features a phenothiazine core the dye s name is frequently misspelled with omission of the e the ine ending indicates that the compound is an amine thionine is a strongly staining metachromatic dye which is widely used for biological staining thionine can also be used in place of schiff reagent in quantitative feulgen staining of dna it can also be used to mediate electron transfer in microbial fuel cells thionine is a ph dependent redox indicator with e 0 06 at ph 7 0 its reduced form leuco thionine is colorless when both the amines are dimethylated the product tetramethyl thionine is the famous methylene blue and the intermediates are azure c monomethyl thionine azure a when one of the amines is dimethylated and the other remains a primary amine and azure b trimethyl thionine when methylene blue is polychromed by ripening oxidized in solution or metabolized by fungal contamination as originally noted in the thesis of dr d l romanowski in 1890s it forms

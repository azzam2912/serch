while the term skew lattice can be used to refer to any non commutative generalization of a lattice since 1989 it has been used primarily as follows a skew lattice is a set s equipped with two associative idempotent binary operations formula 1 and formula 2 called meet and join that validate the following dual pair of absorption laws formula 3 formula 4 given that formula 5 and formula 6 are associative and idempotent these identities are equivalent to validating the following dual pair of statements formula 7 if formula 8 formula 9 if formula 10 for over 60 years noncommutative variations of lattices have been studied with differing motivations for some the motivation has been an interest in the conceptual boundaries of lattice theory for others it was a search for noncommutative forms of logic and boolean algebra and for others it has been the behavior of idempotents in rings a noncommutative lattice generally speaking is an algebra formula 11 where formula 6 and formula 5 are associative idempotent binary operations connected by absorption identities guaranteeing that formula 6 in some way dualizes formula 5 the precise identities chosen depends upon the underlying motivation with differing choices producing distinct

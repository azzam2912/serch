an example would be that quantum mechanics is ultimately incomplete and that a complete theory would provide descriptive categories to account for all observable behavior and thus avoid any indeterminism in another version the hidden variables are inaccessible to us and thus in principle not detectable the existence of indeterminacy for some measurements is a characteristic of prevalent interpretations of quantum mechanics moreover bounds for indeterminacy can be expressed in a quantitative form by the heisenberg uncertainty principle albert einstein objected to the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and famously declared i am convinced god does not play dice einstein podolsky and rosen argued that quantum mechanics is an incomplete description of reality bell s theorem would later suggest that local hidden variables a way for finding a complete description of reality of certain types are impossible or that they evolve non locally a famous non local theory is the de broglie bohm theory under the copenhagen interpretation quantum mechanics is non deterministic meaning that it generally does not predict the outcome of any measurement with certainty instead it indicates what the probabilities of the outcomes are with the indeterminism of observable quantities constrained by the uncertainty principle the

very often ce refers to capillary zone electrophoresis cze but other electrophoretic techniques including capillary gel electrophoresis cge capillary isoelectric focusing cief capillary isotachophoresis and micellar electrokinetic chromatography mekc belong also to this class of methods in ce methods analytes migrate through electrolyte solutions under the influence of an electric field analytes can be separated according to ionic mobility and or partitioning into an alternate phase via non covalent interactions additionally analytes may be concentrated or focused by means of gradients in conductivity and ph the instrumentation needed to perform capillary electrophoresis is relatively simple a basic schematic of a capillary electrophoresis system is shown in figure 1 the system s main components are a sample vial source and destination vials a capillary electrodes a high voltage power supply a detector and a data output and handling device the source vial destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution to introduce the sample the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action pressure siphoning or electrokinetically and the capillary is then returned to the source vial the migration of the analytes is

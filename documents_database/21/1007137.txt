behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses behind the nasal cavity air next passes through the pharynx shared with the digestive system and then into the rest of the respiratory system in humans the nose is located centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory passage especially during suckling for infants acting as the first interface between the external environment and an animal s delicate internal lungs a nose conditions incoming air both as a function of thermal regulation and filtration during respiration as well as enabling the sensory perception of smell hair inside nostrils filter incoming air as a first line of defense against dust particles smoke and other potential obstructions that would otherwise inhibit respiration and as a kind of filter against airborne illness in addition to acting as a filter mucus produced within the nose supplements the body s effort to maintain temperature as well as contributes moisture to integral components of the respiratory system capillary structures of the nose warm and humidify air entering the body later this role in retaining moisture enables conditions for alveoli to properly exchange o for co i e respiration within the lungs during exhalation the

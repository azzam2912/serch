957 was a tamil ruler of the chola mandalam he was the third son of parantaka i and the younger brother of gandaraditya chola whom he is thought to have succeeded in about 956 his mother was the daughter of a kerala prince called paluvettaraiyar arinjaya seems to have ruled for a very short time arinjaya is also referred to by the names arikulakesari arikesari or arindama his name is mentioned in some of gandaraditya s inscriptions as alvar arikulakesarideva there is some confusion regarding whether arinjaya actually succeeded gandaraditya some historians doubt whether arinjaya ruled on his own right there is little epigraphic evidence available to give us any concrete information on arinjaya s rule what we know now is partly speculative and partly informed extrapolations of known facts gandaraditya probably made his younger brother co regent very early in his rule it is also very probable that gandaraditya did not have any heir until very late in his life as a result he must have made arinjaya heir apparent and paved the way for arinjaya s heirs to the line of succession to the chola crown we can gather a good deal information from the epigraphs left behind

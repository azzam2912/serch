since the sample does not include all members of the population statistics on the sample such as means and quartiles generally differ from the characteristics of the entire population which are known as parameters for example if one measures the height of a thousand individuals from a country of one million the average height of the thousand is typically not the same as the average height of all one million people in the country since sampling is typically done to determine the characteristics of a whole population the difference between the sample and population values is considered an error exact measurement of sampling error is generally not feasible since the true population values are unknown in statistics sampling error is the error caused by observing a sample instead of the whole population the sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter and the actual but unknown value of the parameter an estimate of a quantity of interest such as an average or percentage will generally be subject to sample to sample variation these variations in the possible sample values of a statistic can theoretically be expressed as sampling errors although in practice the

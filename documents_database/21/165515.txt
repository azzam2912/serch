organelles in the microbody family include peroxisomes glyoxysomes glycosomes and hydrogenosomes in vertebrates microbodies are especially prevalent in the liver and kidney microbodies are different type of bodies present in the cytosol also known as cytosomes a microbody is usually a vesicle with a spherical shape ranging from 0 2 1 5 micrometers in diameter microbodies are found in the cytoplasm of a cell but they are only visible with the use of an electron microscope they are surrounded by a single phospholipid bilayer membrane and they contain a matrix of intracellular material including enzymes and other proteins but they do not seem to contain any genetic material to allow them to self replicate microbodies contain enzymes that participate in the preparatory or intermediate stages of biochemical reactions within the cell this facilitates the breakdown of fats alcohols and amino acids generally microbodies are involved in detoxification of peroxides and in photo respiration in plants different types of microbodies have different functions a peroxisome is a type of microbody that functions to help the body break down large molecules and detoxify hazardous substances it contains enzymes like oxidase react hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct of its enzymatic reactions within the

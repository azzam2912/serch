it lies to the west of the large walled plain landau and to the northeast of the crater charlier to the north northwest is the smaller gullstrand this is an unusual formation that forms part of a chain of connected craters the western two thirds of perrine is overlain by the slightly smaller perrine s so that perrine is crescent shaped the western rim of perrine s is overlain by the still smaller perrine t perrine s has a worn outer rim and a small central peak in the middle of the floor the surviving rim of perrine is worn and eroded with the overlapping pair perrine e and perrine g intruding slightly into the eastern rim a smaller crater has disrupted the southwest end of the outer rim and a pair of small craters are attached to the northern rim only a small portion of the interior floor of perrine still survives forming a crescent shaped surface between the outer rampart of perrine s and the inner wall of perrine it is marked by a pair of tiny craterlets in the northern half by convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side

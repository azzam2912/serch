such a program is very simple in most programming languages and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language it is often the first program written by people learning to code a hello world program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language hello world is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed and that the operator understands how to use it while small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers the tradition of using the phrase hello world as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book the c programming language the example program in that book prints and was inherited from a 1974 bell laboratories internal memorandum by brian kernighan programming in c a tutorial the c language version was preceded by kernighan s own 1972 a tutorial introduction to the language b where the first known version of the program is found in an example used to illustrate external variables the program prints on the terminal including a newline character the phrase is divided into multiple variables because in b a

it has the bayer designation b draconis while 39 draconis is the flamsteed designation this system is visible to the naked eye as a dim white hued point of light with an apparent visual magnitude of 5 0 parallax measurements made by the hipparcos spacecraft put it at a distance of 184 light years or 56 parsecs away from the sun the system is moving closer to the earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of 24 5 km s the two components of 39 draconis have an angular separation of and take almost 4 000 years to orbit each other the primary star is an early a type main sequence star having 2 12 times the mass of the sun with a visual magnitude of 5 06 the secondary is a magnitude 8 07 f type main sequence star and has 1 18 times the mass of the sun the 8th magnitude star hd 238865 is listed in double star catalogues as component c it is separated from the other two stars by and lies at about the same distance it is itself a spectroscopic binary with an f8 primary and a red dwarf secondary orbiting every 2 7 days

it has a gray color with a greenish tint in reflected light w stite crystallizes in the isometric hexoctahedral crystal system in opaque to translucent metallic grains it has a mohs hardness of 5 to 5 5 and a specific gravity of 5 88 w stite is a typical example of a non stoichiometric compound w stite was named for fritz w st 1860 1938 a german metallurgist and founding director of the kaiser wilhelm institut f r eisenforschung presently max planck institute for iron research gmbh in addition to the type locality in germany it has been reported from disko island greenland the jharia coalfield jharkhand india and as inclusions in diamonds in a number of kimberlite pipes it also is reported from deep sea manganese nodules its presence indicates a highly reducing environment w stite in geochemistry defines a redox buffer of oxidation within rocks at which point the rock is so reduced that fe and thus hematite is absent as the redox state of a rock is further reduced magnetite is converted to w stite this occurs by conversion of the fe ions in magnetite to fe ions an example reaction is presented below the formula for

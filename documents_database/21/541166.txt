it organizes elements according to an idealized orbital filling instead of valence for example the elements sc to zn are shown as a 3d block implying orbital occupancy ar 4s 3d although it is now known that cr actually has orbital occupancy ar 4s 3d and cu has ar 4s 3d compared to the common layout the left step table has these changes in the result the order is still consistently by atomic number z 1 120 in theodor benfey s periodic table the elements form a two dimensional spiral starting from hydrogen and folding their way around two peninsulas the transition metals and lanthanides and actinides a superactinide island is already slotted in paul gigu re s 3 d periodic table consists of four connected billboards with the elements written on the front and the back the first billboard has the group 1 elements on the front and the group 2 elements at the back with hydrogen and helium omitted altogether at a 90 angle the second billboard contains the groups 13 to 18 front and back two more billboards each making 90 angles contain the other elements timothy stowe s physicist s periodic table is three dimensional with

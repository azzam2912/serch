incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are described as thermal treatment incineration of waste materials converts the waste into ash flue gas and heat the ash is mostly formed by the inorganic constituents of the waste and may take the form of solid lumps or particulates carried by the flue gas the flue gases must be cleaned of gaseous and particulate pollutants before they are dispersed into the atmosphere in some cases the heat generated by incineration can be used to generate electric power incineration with energy recovery is one of several waste to energy technologies such as gasification pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion while incineration and gasification technologies are similar in principle the energy produced from incineration is high temperature heat whereas combustible gas is often the main energy product from gasification incineration and gasification may also be implemented without energy and materials recovery in several countries there are still concerns from experts and local communities about the environmental effect of incinerators see arguments against incineration in some countries incinerators built just a few decades ago often did not include a materials separation to remove hazardous bulky or recyclable materials before combustion these facilities tended to risk the

m keck observatory in 2010 the planet is found in an m type dwarf star catalogued as hip 79431 and is located within the scorpius constellation approximately 47 light years away from the earth its orbital period lasts about 111 7 days and has an orbital eccentricity of 0 29 the planet is the 6th giant planet to be detected in the doppler surveys of m dwarfs and is considered to be one of the most massive planets found around m dwarf stars hip 79431 b is located in orbit around a star whose metallicity had been challenging to be assessed due to the uncertainties within the molecular data line however it has not been typical for m dwarfs to have strong emissions from the core data lines this led to the inclusion of the hip 79431 star to the keck program in april 2009 as part of the exoplanet studies for low mass stars during this study 13 doppler measurements of the star were done over a 6 month period using the high resolution echelle spectrometer hires the exposure times used in its observation was 600 seconds which yielded a signal to noise ratio of just under 100 each

it is named for the telescope that discovered it a nasa spacecraft named kepler that is designed to detect earth like planets by measuring small dips in the brightness of their host stars as the planets cross in front this process known as the transit method was used to note the presence of six planets in orbit around kepler 11 of which kepler 11d is the third from its star kepler 11d orbits kepler 11 well within the orbit of mercury approximately every 23 days the planet is approximately six times more massive than the earth and has a radius that is three and a half times larger than that of earth s it is however far hotter than earth is its low density comparable to that of saturn suggests that kepler 11d has a large hydrogen helium atmosphere kepler 11d was announced with its five sister planets on february 2 2011 after extensive follow up studies as with all exoplanets kepler 11d is named first for its host star kepler 11 because kepler 11d was announced at the same time as the five other planets in the system their names are sorted by their distances from the host star

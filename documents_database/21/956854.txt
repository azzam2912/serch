journal rankings are intended to reflect the place of a journal within its field the relative difficulty of being published in that journal and the prestige associated with it they have been introduced as official research evaluation tools in several countries traditionally journal ranking measures or evaluations have been provided simply through institutional lists established by academic leaders or through committee vote these approaches have been notoriously politicized and inaccurate reflections of actual prestige and quality as they would often reflect the biases and personal career objectives of those involved in ranking the journals also causing the problem of highly disparate evaluations across institutions consequently many institutions have required external sources of evaluation of journal quality the traditional approach here has been through surveys of leading academics in a given field but this approach too has potential for bias though not as profound as that seen with institution generated lists consequently governments institutions and leaders in scientometric research have turned to a litany of observed bibliometric measures on the journal level that can be used as surrogates for quality and thus eliminate the need for subjective assessment consequently several journal level metrics have been proposed most citation based negative consequences

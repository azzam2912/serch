these expressions are the maclaurin series expansions of the trigonometric sine cosine and arctangent functions and the special case of the power series expansion of the arctangent function yielding a formula for computing the power series expansions of sine and cosine functions are respectively called madhava s sine series and madhava s cosine series the power series expansion of the arctangent function is sometimes called madhava gregory series or gregory madhava series these power series are also collectively called taylor madhava series the formula for is referred to as madhava newton series or madhava leibniz series or leibniz formula for pi or leibnitz gregory madhava series these further names for the various series are reflective of the names of the western discoverers or popularizers of the respective series the derivations use many calculus related concepts such as summation rate of change and interpolation which suggests that indian mathematicians had a solid understanding of the concept of limit and the basics of calculus long before they were developed in europe other evidence from indian mathematics up to this point such as interest in infinite series and the use of a base ten decimal system also suggest that it was possible for

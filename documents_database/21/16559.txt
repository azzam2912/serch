it is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is reflected at an interface the reflectance spectrum or spectral reflectance curve is the plot of the reflectance as a function of wavelength the hemispherical reflectance of a surface denoted r is defined as where the spectral hemispherical reflectance in frequency and spectral hemispherical reflectance in wavelength of a surface denoted r and r respectively are defined as where the directional reflectance of a surface denoted r is defined as where the spectral directional reflectance in frequency and spectral directional reflectance in wavelength of a surface denoted r and r respectively are defined as where for homogeneous and semi infinite see halfspace materials reflectivity is the same as reflectance reflectivity is the square of the magnitude of the fresnel reflection coefficient which is the ratio of the reflected to incident electric field as such the reflection coefficient can be expressed as a complex number as determined by the fresnel equations for a single layer whereas the reflectance is always a positive real number for layered and finite media according to the cie reflectivity is distinguished from reflectance by the fact that reflectivity is a value that applies to thick reflecting objects

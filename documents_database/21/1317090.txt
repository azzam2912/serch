this method enables scientists to separate different cells with different sizes since cell size is correlated with cell cycle stages this method also allows the separation of cells at different stages of the cell cycle the key concept is that larger cells tend to stay within the flowing buffer solution while smaller cells will be washed away follow the buffer solution different sedimentation property within the buffer solution and cells will have different sedimentation properties in different cell cycle stages the basic principle of separating the cells inside cce is the balance between centripetal and the counter flow drag force when the cells enter the elutriation chamber all the cells will stay at the outer edge of the chamber due to centrifugal force then when the flow rate of the buffer solution increases the solution tends to push the cells towards the middle of the cce when the counter flow drag force outweighs the centripetal force particles will be driven by the net force and leave the chamber smaller particles are able to leave the chamber at lower flow rates in contrast larger particles will stay within the elutriation chamber therefore buffer flow rate can be used to control size

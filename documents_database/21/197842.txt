from beside the nose which abducts depresses and internally rotates the eye it is the only extraocular muscle innervated by the trochlear nerve the fourth cranial nerve the superior oblique muscle loops through a pulley like structure the trochlea of superior oblique and inserts into the sclera on the posterotemporal surface of the eyeball it is the pulley system that gives superior oblique its actions causing depression of the eyeball despite being inserted on the superior surface the superior oblique arises immediately above the margin of the optic foramen superior and medial to the origin of the superior rectus and passing forward ends in a rounded tendon which plays in a fibrocartilaginous ring or pulley attached to the trochlear fossa of the frontal bone the contiguous surfaces of the tendon and ring are lined by a delicate mucous sheath and enclosed in a thin fibrous investment the tendon is reflected caudally laterally and inferiorly beneath the superior rectus to the lateral part of the bulb of the eye and is inserted onto the scleral surface behind the equator of the eyeball the insertion of the muscle lying between the superior rectus and lateral rectus the primary main action of the

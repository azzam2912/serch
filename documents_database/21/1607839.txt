polymorphism is appearance of forms or morphs differing in colour and number of attributes within a single species in lepidoptera polymorphism can be seen not only between individuals in a population but also between the sexes as sexual dimorphism between geographically separated populations in geographical polymorphism and also between generations flying at different seasons of the year seasonal polymorphism it also includes the phenomenon of mimicry when mimetic morphs fly alongside non mimetic morphs in a population of a particular species polymorphism occurs both at specific level with heritable variation in the overall morphological design of individuals as well as in certain specific morphological or physiological traits within a species genetic polymorphism occurs when the morphs are a result of genetic determination only the extreme case of genetic polymorphism is that of the papilionid great mormon papilio memnon where four male forms and many as twenty six female forms are reported this species and others in its genus have been extensively studied for understanding the genetic basis for polymorphism and batesian mimicry in the case of the scarlet tiger moth callimorpha panaxia dominula family arctiidae which is a diurnal moth occurs in continental europe western asia and southern england three

it is based on the interaction of an external field with the electric dipole moment of the sample often expressed by permittivity it is also an experimental method of characterizing electrochemical systems this technique measures the impedance of a system over a range of frequencies and therefore the frequency response of the system including the energy storage and dissipation properties is revealed often data obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is expressed graphically in a bode plot or a nyquist plot impedance is the opposition to the flow of alternating current ac in a complex system a passive complex electrical system comprises both energy dissipater resistor and energy storage capacitor elements if the system is purely resistive then the opposition to ac or direct current dc is simply resistance materials or systems exhibiting multiple phases such as composites or heterogeneous materials commonly show a universal dielectric response whereby dielectric spectroscopy reveals a power law relationship between the impedance or the inverse term admittance and the frequency of the applied ac field almost any physico chemical system such as electrochemical cells mass beam oscillators and even biological tissue possesses energy storage and dissipation properties eis examines them this technique has grown

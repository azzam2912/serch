facilitations can be categorized as mutualisms in which both species benefit or commensalisms in which one species benefits and the other is unaffected much of classic ecological theory e g natural selection niche separation metapopulation dynamics has focused on negative interactions such as predation and competition but positive interactions facilitation are receiving increasing focus in ecological research this article addresses both the mechanisms of facilitation and the increasing information available concerning the impacts of facilitation on community ecology there are two basic categories of facilitative interactions strict categorization however is not possible for some complex species interactions for example seed germination and survival in harsh environments is often higher under so called nurse plants than on open ground a nurse plant is one with an established canopy beneath which germination and survival are more likely due to increased shade soil moisture and nutrients thus the relationship between seedlings and their nurse plants is commensal however as the seedlings grow into established plants they are likely to compete with their former benefactors for resources the beneficial effects of species on one another are realized in various ways including refuge from physical stress predation and competition improved resource availability and transport facilitation

every quasinormal operator on a finite dimensional hilbert space is normal let a be a bounded operator on a hilbert space h then a is said to be quasinormal if a commutes with a a i e a normal operator is necessarily quasinormal let a up be the polar decomposition of a if a is quasinormal then up pu to see this notice that the positive factor p in the polar decomposition is of the form a a the unique positive square root of a a quasinormality means a commutes with a a as a consequence of the continuous functional calculus for self adjoint operators a commutes with p a a also i e so up pu on the range of p on the other hand if h h lies in kernel of p clearly up h 0 but pu h 0 as well because u is a partial isometry whose initial space is closure of range p finally the self adjointness of p implies that h is the direct sum of its range and kernel thus the argument given proves up pu on all of h on the other hand one can readily verify that if up pu then

maryanoff and coworkers during the late 1970s 1980s the structure is a pyrroloisoquinoline core with an overlaid benzhydryl motif incorporating the pyrrolidino ring onto the tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffolding markedly improves potency although this only works for one of the available stereoisomers jnj 7925476 is a racemic preparation of the more potent diastereomer of these enantiomers the eutomer is the 6 r 10b s stereoisomer known as jnj 39836966 and the distomer 6 s 10b r is jnj 39836732 there is some confusion over the nomenclature and cis trans isomeric relationship at the piperidine ring the compounds as depicted have the carbon of the pyrrolidine carbon and the phenyl cis but maryanoff and coworkers are of the opinion that the compound is trans see abstract the reason for this is not known because it was referred to as cis in earlier reports and then later reassigned ki values nm for jnj 7925476 and its constituent enantiomers jnj 39836966 and jnj 39836732 in vitro jnj 7925476 is 18 fold selective for the hsert 0 9 nm over the hnet 16 6 nm ex vivo transporter occupancy of jnj 7925476 in rat brain followed the ordering priority net sert dat this is consistent with

david gilmour stated there was a wonderful moment of optimism when the wall came down the release of eastern europe from the non democratic side of the socialist system but what they have now doesn t seem to be much better again i m fairly pessimistic about it all i sort of wish and live in hope but i tend to think that history moves at a much slower pace than we think it does i feel that real change takes a long long time despite gilmour s statements to the contrary the lyrics have often been read as a reflection on the bitter and estranged partnership gilmour had with former bandmate roger waters who was the driving force behind the band s album the wall by this interpretation the great day for freedom would be the day waters left the band giving the other members freedom to determine the band s future direction gilmour commented on this reading i m quite happy for people to interpret the division bell any way they like but maybe a note of caution should be sounded because you can read too much into it a great day for freedom for example has got

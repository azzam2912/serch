3rd century ad was a greek philosopher from alexandria who was often referred to as one of the founders of neoplatonism he is mainly known as the teacher of plotinus whom he taught for eleven years from 232 to 243 he was undoubtedly the biggest influence on plotinus in his development of neoplatonism although little is known about his own philosophical views later christian writers stated that ammonius was a christian but it is now generally assumed that there was a different ammonius of alexandria who wrote biblical texts while many scholars have interpreted the cognomen sakkas as indicating he was a porter in his youth others have asserted that this is a misreading of sakkas for sakkophoros porter which is grammatically incorrect and or have connected the moniker with the kyas an ancient ruling clan of india and thus have claimed that ammonius saccas was of indian origin this latter view has both been subsequently contested and supported by more recent scholarship some scholars supporting the view of the indian origins of ammonius saccas have also contended that said ancestry is consistent with the passion of his foremost student plotinus for india and helps to explain the philosophical similarities

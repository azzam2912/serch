water the first chemical compound in this series contains one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms and is the most common compound on the earth s surface the most important series including water has the chemical formula hx with x representing any chalcogen they are therefore triatomic they take on a bent structure and as such are polar molecules water is an essential compound to life on earth today covering 70 9 of the planet s surface the other hydrogen chalcogenides are usually extremely toxic and have strong unpleasant scents usually resembling rotting eggs or vegetables hydrogen sulfide is a common product of decomposition in oxygen poor environments and as such is one chemical responsible for the smell of flatulence it is also a volcanic gas despite its toxicity the human body intentionally produces it in small enough doses for use as a signaling molecule water can dissolve the other hydrogen chalcogenides at least those up to hydrogen telluride forming acidic solutions known as hydrochalcogenic acids although these are weaker acids than the hydrohalic acids they follow a similar trend of acid strength increasing with heavier chalcogens and also form in a similar way turning the water into a hydronium

i did it on purpose to see if i could come up with anything raitt said in 1991 in case i won i wanted to make sure that i had done some writing and didn t feel that nick of time was a fluke i didn t want to win just cause i quit drinking and spent twenty years not making any money you know there wasn t enough so i basically forced myself to go to songwriting boot camp there were three of four days when it didn t happen but because i didn t have alcohol or unhappiness or anything to get in the way it started to open up and i started three of the four songs of mine that are on this album and then it didn t matter if i won or not because i had proved to myself that it was okay the album surpassed nick of time s commercial success having sold seven million copies in the united states alone by 2010 and was supported by a 180 date tour from 1991 to 1993 it replicated much of her u s success overseas as well selling two million in france and italy it

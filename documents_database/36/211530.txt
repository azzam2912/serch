a machine that exploits wave power is a wave energy converter wec wave power is distinct from tidal power which captures the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon waves and tides are also distinct from ocean currents which are caused by other forces including breaking waves wind the coriolis effect cabbeling and differences in temperature and salinity wave power generation is not a widely employed commercial technology compared to other established renewable energy sources such as wind wind turbine and solar photovoltaic however there have been attempts to use this source of energy since at least 1890 mainly due to its high power density as a comparison the power density of the photovoltaic panels is 1 kw m at peak solar insolation and the power density of the wind is 1 kw m at 12 m s for a general electric ge 1 5 mw machine whereas the average annual power density of the waves at e g san francisco coast is 25 kw m in 2000 the world s first commercial wave power device the islay limpet was installed on the coast of islay in scotland and connected to the national

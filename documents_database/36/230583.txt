originally a part of the ancient continent of gondwana australia remained connected to india and antarctica until approximately when india broke away and began moving north australia and antarctica began rifting and completely separated roughly the australian plate later fused with the adjacent indian plate beneath the indian ocean to form a single indo australian plate however recent studies suggest that the two plates have once again split apart and have been separate plates for at least 3 million years and likely longer the australian plate includes the continent of australia including tasmania as well portions of new guinea new zealand and the indian ocean basin the northeasterly side is a complex but generally convergent boundary with the pacific plate the pacific plate is subducting under the australian plate which forms the tonga and kermadec trenches and the parallel tonga and kermadec island arcs it has also uplifted the eastern parts of new zealand s north island the continent of zealandia which separated from australia 85 million years ago and stretches from new caledonia in the north to new zealand s subantarctic islands in the south is now being torn apart along the transform boundary marked by the alpine fault

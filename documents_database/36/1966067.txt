however in some sense the condition is optimal littlewood showed that if c is any unbounded sequence then there is a series with a c n which is divergent but abel summable described his discovery of the proof of his tauberian theorem alfred tauber s original theorem was similar to littlewoods but with the stronger hypothesis that a o 1 n hardy had proved a similar theorem for ces ro summation with the weaker hypothesis a o 1 n and suggested to littlewood that the same weaker hypothesis might also be enough for tauber s theorem in spite of the fact that the hypothesis in littlewood s theorem seems only slightly weaker than the hypothesis in tauber s theorem littlewood s proof was far harder than tauber s though jovan karamata later found an easier proof littlewood s theorem follows from the later hardy littlewood tauberian theorem which is in turn a special case of wiener s tauberian theorem which itself is a special case of various abstract tauberian theorems about banach algebras

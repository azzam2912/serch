therefore it has an important function wh1 domains are found on wasp proteins which are often involved in actin polymerization hence wh1 is important for all cellular processes involving actin this includes cell motility cell trafficking cell division and cytokinesis cell signalling and the establishment and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape the wasp protein family control actin polymerization by activating the arp2 3 complex wasp is defective in wiskott aldrich syndrome was whereby in most patient cases the majority of point mutations occur within the n terminal wh1 domain the metabotropic glutamate receptors mglur1alpha and mglur5 bind a protein called homer which is a wh1 domain homologue a subset of wh1 domains has been termed the evh1 domain and appear to bind a polyproline motif the evh1 wh1 ranbp1 wasp domain is found in multi domain proteins implicated in a diverse range of signalling nuclear transport and cytoskeletal events this domain of around 115 amino acids is present in species ranging from yeast to mammals many evh1 containing proteins associate with actin based structures and play a role in cytoskeletal organisation evh1 domains recognise and bind the proline rich motif fpppp with low affinity further interactions then form

the natural instincts of each species lead towards antagonistic interactions though individual animals can have non aggressive relationships with each other particularly under conditions where humans have socialized non aggressive behaviors the generally aggressive interactions between the species have been noted in cultural expressions in domestic homes where dog and cat are reared and trained properly they tend to relate well with each other especially when their owner is taking good care of them the signals and behaviors that cats and dogs use to communicate are different and can lead to signals of aggression fear dominance friendship or territoriality being misinterpreted by the other species dogs have a natural instinct to chase smaller animals that flee an instinct common among cats most cats flee from a dog while others take actions such as hissing arching their backs and swiping at the dog after being scratched by a cat some dogs can become fearful of cats if appropriately socialized cats and dogs may have relationships that are not antagonistic and dogs raised with cats may prefer the presence of cats to other dogs even cats and dogs that have got along together in the same household may revert to aggressive reactions

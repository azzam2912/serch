during the middle ages gold and silver coins saw widespread use as currency in europe and facilitated trade with the middle east and asia the shortage of these metals therefore become a problem for european economies many causes for the famine have been proposed such as the hundred years war 1337 1453 depopulation and poor agricultural output due to the aftermath of the black death 1346 1353 and an outflow of silver to the east unmatched by mining output the late middle ages particularly saw a deficit in silver rather than gold numerous factors may have caused the great bullion famine in the 14th century the black death ravaged europe killing over half of its population and leaving many areas heavily depopulated and unable to meet previous levels of economic production in addition europe had a long running precious metal deficit in its trade with the middle east and asia ever since the days of the roman empire this is due to the fact that products from china and india such as spices silks and cotton were very rare or completely unavailable in europe and thus highly valued but europe lacked as many goods to trade back to the east

in particular for formula 2 a random r regular graph of large size is asymptotically almost surely r connected in other words although r regular graphs with connectivity less than r exist the probability of selecting such a graph tends to 0 as n increases if formula 3 0 is a positive constant and d is the least integer satisfying formula 4 then asymptotically almost surely a random r regular graph has diameter at most d there is also a more complex lower bound on the diameter of r regular graphs so that almost all r regular graphs of the same size have almost the same diameter the distribution of the number of short cycles is also known for fixed m 3 let y y y be the number of cycles of lengths up to m then the y are asymptotically independent poisson random variables with means formula 5 it is non trivial to implement the random selection of r regular graphs efficiently and in an unbiased way since most graphs are not regular the pairing model also configuration model is a method which takes nr points and partitions them into n buckets with r points in each of them

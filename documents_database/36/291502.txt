these machines are ruled out in most models of computation more formally a zeno machine is a turing machine that takes 2 units of time to perform its n th step thus the first step takes 0 5 units of time the second takes 0 25 the third 0 125 and so on so that after one unit of time a countably infinite i e number of steps will have been performed the idea of zeno machines was first discussed by hermann weyl in 1927 the name refers to zeno s paradoxes attributed to the ancient greek philosopher zeno of elea zeno machines play a crucial role in some theories the theory of the omega point devised by physicist frank j tipler for instance can only be valid if zeno machines are possible zeno machines would allow some functions to be computed that are not turing computable for example the halting problem for turing machines can be solved by a zeno machine using the following pseudocode algorithm computing of this kind that goes beyond the turing limit is called hypercomputation in this case hypercomputation through a supertask see there for further discussion and literature

ruts can be formed by wear as from studded snow tires common in cold climate areas or they can form through the deformation of the asphalt concrete pavement or subbase material the main reason is heavy loaded truck acts more pressure than assumed during the construction of roads these heavy loaded trucks will imprint the tire impression on roads causing ruts ruts prevent rainwater from flowing to the side of the road into ditches or gutters rainwater trapped in ruts is a common contributing factor to hydroplaning crashes severe ruts can impede steering if a vehicle has difficulty steering out of the rut if it proves impossible to steer out of a rut though forward and backward progress can be made by the vehicle it is referred to as being stuck in the rut ruts in gravel roads can be removed by grading the road surface ruts in asphalt pavement can be filled with asphalt then overlaid with another layer of asphalt but better results can usually be achieved by grinding off the surface to restore the proper cross slope then resurfacing if the ruts are formed due to deformation of the subbase below the pavement the only long term

although the term can be used in the context of physical training it most often occurs in the academic world most high schools colleges and universities run final exams at the end of a particular academic term typically a quarter or semester or more traditionally at the end of a complete degree course the purpose of the test is to make a final review of the topics covered and assessment of each student s knowledge of the subject a final is technically just a greater form of a unit test they have the same purpose finals are simply larger not all courses or curricula culminate in a final exam instructors may assign a term paper or final project in some courses the weighting of the final exam also varies it may be the largest or only factor in the student s course grade in other cases it may carry the same weight as a midterm exam or the student may be exempted not all finals need be cumulative however as some simply cover the material presented since the last exam for example a microbiology course might only cover fungi and parasites on the final exam if this were the policy

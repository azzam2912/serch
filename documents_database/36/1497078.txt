conductometry has notable application in analytical chemistry where conductometric titration is a standard technique in usual analytical chemistry practice the term conductometry is used as a synonym of conductometric titration while the term conductimetry is used to describe non titrative applications conductometry is often applied to determine the total conductance of a solution or to analyze the end point of titrations that include ions conductive measurements began as early as the 18th century when andreas baumgartner noticed that salt and mineral waters from bad gastein in austria conducted electricity as such using conductometry to determine water purity which is often used today to test the effectiveness of water purification systems began in 1776 friedrich kohlrausch further developed conductometry in the 1860s when he applied alternating current to water acids and other solutions it was also around this time when willis whitney who was studying the interactions of sulfuric acid and chromium sulfate complexes found the first conductometric endpoint these finding culminated into potentiometric titrations and the first instrument for volumetric analysis by robert behrend in 1883 while titrating chloride and bromide with hgno3 this development allowed for testing the solubility of salts and hydrogen ion concentration as well as acid

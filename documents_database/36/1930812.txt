it has the formula nbse it was the first reported example of one dimensional compound to exhibit the phenomenon of sliding charge density waves due to its many studies and exhibited phenomena in quantum mechanics niobium triselenide has become the model system for quasi 1 d charge density waves niobium triselenide has a highly anisotropic structure the nb centers are bound within trigonal prisms defined by six se ligands the nbse prisms form infinite chains lined up in parallel although the prisms share the same coordination the cell consists of three chain types repeated twice where each chain is defined by its se se bond length the se se bond lengths are 2 37 2 48 2 91 angstroms the compound is prepared by the solid state reaction by heating niobium and selenium at 600 to 700 c the resulting black crystals can contain nbse impurities samples can be purified by chemical vapor transport cvt between 650 and 700 c the lower limit of cvt was determined by the temperature at which nbse is no longer stable measurements on nbse provided significant evidence for charge density wave cdw transport cdw pinning magnetism shubnikov de hass oscillations and the aharonov bohm

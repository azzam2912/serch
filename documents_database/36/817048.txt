receptor ligand binding kinetics also involves the on and off rates of binding a main goal of receptor ligand kinetics is to determine the concentrations of the various kinetic species i e the states of the receptor and ligand at all times from a given set of initial concentrations and a given set of rate constants in a few cases an analytical solution of the rate equations may be determined but this is relatively rare however most rate equations can be integrated numerically or approximately using the steady state approximation a less ambitious goal is to determine the final equilibrium concentrations of the kinetic species which is adequate for the interpretation of equilibrium binding data a converse goal of receptor ligand kinetics is to estimate the rate constants and or dissociation constants of the receptors and ligands from experimental kinetic or equilibrium data the total concentrations of receptor and ligands are sometimes varied systematically to estimate these constants the binding constant is a special case of the equilibrium constant formula 1 it is associated with the binding and unbinding reaction of receptor r and ligand l molecules which is formalized as the reaction is characterized by the on rate constant

it uses computer vision technology to recognize and track planar images and 3d objects in real time this image registration capability enables developers to position and orient virtual objects such as 3d models and other media in relation to real world objects when they are viewed through the camera of a mobile device the virtual object then tracks the position and orientation of the image in real time so that the viewer s perspective on the object corresponds with the perspective on the target it thus appears that the virtual object is a part of the real world scene the vuforia sdk supports a variety of 2d and 3d target types including markerless image targets 3d model target and a form of addressable fiducial marker known as a vumark additional features of the sdk include 6 degrees of freedom device localization in space localized occlusion detection using virtual buttons runtime image target selection and the ability to create and reconfigure target sets programmatically at runtime vuforia provides application programming interfaces api in c java objective c and the net languages through an extension to the unity game engine in this way the sdk supports both native development for ios android

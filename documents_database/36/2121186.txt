according to harvard university the main externalities of driving are local and global pollution oil dependence traffic congestion and traffic accidents while according to a meta study conducted by the delft university these externalities are congestion and scarcity costs accident costs air pollution costs noise costs climate change costs costs for nature and landscape costs for water pollution costs for soil pollution and costs of energy dependency the negative externalities seem to be the most obvious to confirm since the driver does not take into account for example the negative effects of air pollution on third parties when they opt to drive their car the legislators and the regulators shall therefore internalize those external costs either by taxes on fuels for example either by any kind of limitation to car usage such as parking meters or urban tolls nevertheless it seems the drivers in some countries already pay some external costs with taxes road taxes in the netherlands for instance have a relatively high yearly value which covers the maintenance of the infrastructures nevertheless in the majority of western nations the external costs of driving are not covered totally either by taxes or by any kind of car usage limitation

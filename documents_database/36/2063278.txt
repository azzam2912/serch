a global optimization problem requires to minimize a function called objective function subject to a set of constraints both the objective function and the constraints might be nonlinear and nonconvex for solving these problems couenne uses a reformulation procedure and provides a linear programming approximation of any nonconvex optimization problem couenne is an implementation of a branch and bound where every subproblem is solved by constructing a linear programming relaxation to obtain a lower bound branching may occur at both continuous and integer variables which is necessary in global optimization problems it requires the input to be specified in a mathematical programming language ampl nl format so as to be used from ampl and writes as an output a file sol containing the best solution found until that moment if the optimization is interrupted or the global optimum if it completes without interruption the development of couenne began in 2006 within a collaboration between ibm and carnegie mellon university it is open source software and is currently released under the eclipse public license v1 0 the source code is available for download in the computational infrastructure for operations research coin or repository and on github couenne uses other packages both

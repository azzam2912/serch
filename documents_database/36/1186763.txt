it allows one to design one s own statistical or simulation models perform monte carlo simulations and bayesian inference through markov chain monte carlo simulations the latest version allow the use of simulated tempering mcmc simulations gnu mcsim is a simulation and statistical inference tool for algebraic or differential equation systems optimized for performing monte carlo analysis the software comprises a model generator and a simulation engine internally the software uses the gnu scientific library for some of its numerical calculations the project began in 1991 in berkeley when don maszle and frederic y bois translated in c and reorganized a program that bois had developed at harvard for his phd thesis the primary motivation for the work was to be able to quickly develop and easily maintain pbpk models however the syntax was defined with enough generality that many algebraic and first order ordinary differential equations can be solved the capability to perform efficient monte carlo simulations was added early on for the research needs of the group the code was made freely available from a server at uc berkeley discussions with stuart beal at ucsf school of pharmacy led the team to investigate the use of markov chain

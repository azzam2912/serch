turn and bank indicator and the turn coordinator tc variant are essentially two aircraft flight instruments in one device one indicates the rate of turn or the rate of change in the aircraft s heading the other part indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight showing the slip or skid of the turn the slip indicator is actually an inclinometer that at rest displays the angle of the aircraft s transverse axis with respect to horizontal and in motion displays this angle as modified by the acceleration of the aircraft the most commonly used units are degrees per second deg s or minutes per turn min tr the turn and slip indicator can be referred to as the turn and bank indicator although the instrument does not respond directly to bank angle neither does the turn coordinator but it does respond to roll rate which enables it to respond more quickly to the start of a turn the turn indicator is a gyroscopic instrument that works on the principle of precession the gyro is mounted in a gimbal the gyro s rotational axis is in line with the transverse pitch axis of the aircraft while the gimbal has limited

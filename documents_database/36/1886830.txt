with other atoms fluorine forms either polar covalent bonds or ionic bonds most frequently covalent bonds involving fluorine atoms are single bonds although at least two examples of a higher order bond exist fluoride may act as a bridging ligand between two metals in some complex molecules molecules containing fluorine may also exhibit hydrogen bonding a weaker bridging link to certain nonmetals fluorine s chemistry includes inorganic compounds formed with hydrogen metals nonmetals and even noble gases as well as a diverse set of organic compounds for many elements but not all the highest known oxidation state can be achieved in a fluoride for some elements this is achieved exclusively in a fluoride for others exclusively in an oxide and for still others elements in certain groups the highest oxidation states of oxides and fluorides are always equal while an individual fluorine atom has one unpaired electron molecular fluorine f has all the electrons paired this makes it diamagnetic slightly repelled by magnets with the magnetic susceptibility of 1 2 10 si which is close to theoretical predictions in contrast the diatomic molecules of the neighboring element oxygen with two unpaired electrons per molecule are paramagnetic attracted to magnets the

in some cases salt lakes have a higher concentration of salt than sea water such lakes can also be termed hypersaline lakes an alkalic salt lake that has a high content of carbonate is sometimes termed a soda lake saline lake classification salt lakes form when the water flowing into the lake containing salt or minerals cannot leave because the lake is endorheic terminal the water then evaporates leaving behind any dissolved salts and thus increasing its salinity making a salt lake an excellent place for salt production high salinity will also lead to a unique halophilic flora and fauna in the lake in question sometimes in fact the result may be an absence or near absence of life near the salt lake if the amount of water flowing into a lake is less than the amount evaporated the lake will eventually disappear and leave a dry lake also called playa or salt flat brine lakes consist of water that has reached salt saturation or near saturation brine and may also be heavily saturated with other materials most brine lakes develop as a result of high evaporation rates in an arid climate with a lack of an outlet to the

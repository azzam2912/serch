the ftte architecture allows for many media choices from the te to the work area it may be balanced twisted pair copper multi mode optical fiber or even wireless if an access point is installed in or near the te depending on the user s needs ftte can be deployed in low density or high density configurations a low density system might use one or two inexpensive 8 port ethernet mini switches as an example these switches have eight 10 100 mbit s ethernet copper ports and one 1 gbit s ethernet fiber uplink a high density ftte design might use commonly available 24 or 48 port switches these switches are configured with one 1 gbit s uplink port per twelve 100base tx user ports this relatively high work area to backbone port ratio provides better performance than is typically provided to enterprise users both low and high density ftte architectures provide excellent performance in terms of bandwidth delivered to the work area

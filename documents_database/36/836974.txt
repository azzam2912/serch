the camera is known for its high quality optics and effective optical image stabilization system many professional reviews commended it for its excellent pictures at iso 100 however it has a reputation for excessively smeary noise reduction at higher iso settings which can be ameliorated by using the raw capture mode it uses proprietary lithium ion batteries no storage is built into the camera an mmc sd or sdhc memory card is required high speed sd cards up to 2 gb and sdhc cards up to 32gb are supported the camera has many slr like handling features dual control wheels for aperture and shutter speed manual focus focus by wire zoom rings and a flash hot shoe it is among the largest non slr cameras and is positioned at the high end of the bridge camera market zooming while recording movies is supported since the zoom is manual the camera also includes an extended optical zoom system providing greater optical zoom ability when shooting at lower resolutions giving up to 19 3 zoom at 3mp essentially this crops the center out of the image in camera but can be useful for metering and framing apertures from 2 8 to 11

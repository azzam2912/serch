it is designed for two persons who propel the boat by sculling with two oars one in each hand racing boats often called shells are long narrow and broadly semi circular in cross section in order to reduce drag to a minimum they usually have a fin towards the rear to help prevent roll and yaw originally made from wood shells are now almost always made from a composite material usually carbon fibre reinforced plastic for strength and weight advantages the riggers in sculling apply the forces symmetrically to each side of the boat double sculls is one of the classes recognized by the international rowing federation and the olympics in contrast to the combination of the coxed pair in which the distribution of the riggers means the forces are staggered alternately along the boat the symmetrical forces in sculling make the boat more efficient and so the double scull is faster than the coxless pair a double sculling skiff has a similar layout to a double scull and is rowed in a similar way but usually has a cox as well as two rowers it is clinker built with fixed seats and thole pins and can be skiffed for

two cuts on each flitch trim the bark from the sides and reduces it to a standard board width with squared edges two more cuts at each end set the length lumber can be quickly flat cut with a side by side set of mechanical saws a slower but sturdier method involves passing the log back and forth over a single saw to reduce buckling that may occur along the middle of flat cut boards the initial cut may be offset from the diameter and resulting sections cut further before cutting the flitches flat sawn wood often exhibits flat or slash grain where the angle between the visible growth rings and the width of the board is 45 or less this makes the wood vulnerable to deformation as it dries or if later exposed to moisture flat sawn wood is less stable than quarter sawn or rift sawn wood but can be produced more quickly and at lower cost the face of the board may show curved grain sometimes with intricate patterns

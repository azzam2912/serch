it exists in two versions biomedical and plant depending on the species of the underlying microarray and rnaseq data it was started in january 2004 by scientists from eth zurich and is currently developed and commercialized by nebion ag researchers and scientists from academia and industry use it to identify characterize and validate novel drug targets and biomarkers identify appropriate research models and in general to understand how gene expression changes with different treatments the genevestigator database comprises transciptomic data from numerous public repositories including geo array express and renowned cancer research projects as tcga depending on the license agreement it may also contain data from private gene expression studies all data are manually curated quality controlled and enriched for sample and experiment descriptions derived from corresponding scientific publications the number of species from where the samples are derived is constantly increasing currently the biomedical version contains data from human mouse rat monkey fruitfly and other species and used in biomedical research gene expression studies are from various research areas including oncology immunology neurology dermatology and cardiovascular diseases samples comprise tissue biopsies and cell lines the plant version contains both widely used model species such as arabidopsis and medicago as

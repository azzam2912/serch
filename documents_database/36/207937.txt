other kinds of mathematical coincidences such as integers simultaneously satisfying multiple seemingly unrelated criteria or coincidences regarding units of measurement may also be considered in the class of those coincidences that are of a purely mathematical sort some simply result from sometimes very deep mathematical facts while others appear to come out of the blue given the countably infinite number of ways of forming mathematical expressions using a finite number of symbols the number of symbols used and the precision of approximate equality might be the most obvious way to assess mathematical coincidences but there is no standard and the strong law of small numbers is the sort of thing one has to appeal to with no formal opposing mathematical guidance beyond this some sense of mathematical aesthetics could be invoked to adjudicate the value of a mathematical coincidence and there are in fact exceptional cases of true mathematical significance see ramanujan s constant below which made it into print some years ago as a scientific april fools joke all in all though they are generally to be considered for their curiosity value or perhaps to encourage new mathematical learners at an elementary level sometimes simple rational approximations are exceptionally

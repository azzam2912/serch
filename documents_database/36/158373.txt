detectors can measure the particle energy and other attributes such as momentum spin charge particle type in addition to merely registering the presence of the particle many of the detectors invented and used so far are ionization detectors of which gaseous ionization detectors and semiconductor detectors are most typical and scintillation detectors but other completely different principles have also been applied like erenkov light and transition radiation historical examples detectors for radiation protection the following types of particle detector are widely used for radiation protection and are commercially produced in large quantities for general use within the nuclear medical and environmental fields commonly used detectors for particle and nuclear physics modern detectors in particle physics combine several of the above elements in layers much like an onion detectors designed for modern accelerators are huge both in size and in cost the term counter is often used instead of detector when the detector counts the particles but does not resolve its energy or ionization particle detectors can also usually track ionizing radiation high energy photons or even visible light if their main purpose is radiation measurement they are called radiation detectors but as photons are also massless particles the term particle

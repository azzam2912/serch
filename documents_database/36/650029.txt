note that in this context the adversary is itself an algorithm and not a person a cryptographic algorithm is considered secure if no adversary has a non negligible advantage subject to specified bounds on the adversary s computational resources see concrete security negligible usually means within o 2 where p is a security parameter associated with the algorithm for example p might be the number of bits in a block cipher s key let f be an oracle for the function being studied and let g be an oracle for an idealized function of that type the adversary a is a probabilistic algorithm given f or g as input and which outputs 1 or 0 a s job is to distinguish f from g based on making queries to the oracle that it s given we say formula 1 let f be a random instance of the des block cipher this cipher has 64 bit blocks and a 56 bit key the key therefore selects one of a family of 2 permutations on the 2 possible 64 bit blocks a random des instance means our oracle f computes des using some key k which is unknown to the adversary where

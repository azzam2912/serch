the cardinality of a finite set is a natural number the number of elements in the set the transfinite cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets cardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions two sets have the same cardinality if and only if there is a one to one correspondence bijection between the elements of the two sets in the case of finite sets this agrees with the intuitive notion of size in the case of infinite sets the behavior is more complex a fundamental theorem due to georg cantor shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities and in particular the cardinality of the set of real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers it is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets there is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers this sequence starts with the natural numbers including zero finite cardinals which are followed by the aleph numbers infinite cardinals of well ordered sets the aleph numbers are indexed by ordinal numbers under the assumption

like other gasteroid fungi calostoma do not have the spore discharge mechanism associated with typical gilled fungi ballistospory and instead have enclosed spore bearing structures resembling round puffballs with raised brightly colored spore openings osteoles elevated on a thick gelatinous stalks species have been collected in regions of deciduous temperate tropical or subtropical forests their distribution includes eastern north america central america asia and australasia the common name given to some species prettymouth alludes to the brightly colored raised openings osteoles that may somewhat resemble lips other common names include hotlips and puffball in aspic the unusual fruit body structure has historically led mycologists to suggest various classification schemes based on presumed relationships to other puffball or stomach mushrooms phylogenetic analyses performed in the 2000s show the genus to be evolutionarily related to the bolete mushrooms calostoma species are ectomycorrhizal forming symbiotic associations with trees from various families the type species calostoma cinnabarinum is ectomycorrhizal with oak the original genus description based on the type species calostoma cinnabarinum synonymous with cinnabarina was published by french botanist nicaise auguste desvaux in 1809 before the advent of modern genetic analysis the calostoma was considered to be part of the gasteromycetes a grouping

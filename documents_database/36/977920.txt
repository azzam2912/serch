survey observations were commenced in 2005 ukidss consists of five surveys covering a range of areas and depths using various combinations of five near infrared filters ukidss as a large scale near infrared survey follows 2mass and anticipates the vista telescope in the southern hemisphere it aims to cover 7500 square degrees of the northern sky four particular areas of investigation for ukidss are the coolest and nearest brown dwarfs high redshift dusty starburst galaxies elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters at redshifts 1 eso community immediately upon entering the wfcam science archive wsa and are then released to the world 18 months later of the five surveys in ukidss two are directed towards galactic targets and three are optimized for extra galactic observations the surveys are described here in decreasing order of area the letters refer to spectral regions e g jhk is a combination of near infrared filters more or less synonymous with the near infrared the las extra galactic covers an area of 4000 square degrees in yjhk to a depth of k 18 4 this area has previously been covered at optical wavelengths in the sloan digital sky survey while the high galactic latitudes covered by the

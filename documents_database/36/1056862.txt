it was first written down independently by o kobayashi and r schoen and takes its name from h yamabe let formula 1 be a compact smooth manifold without boundary of dimension formula 2 the normalized einstein hilbert functional formula 3 assigns to each riemannian metric formula 4 on formula 1 a real number as follows where formula 7 is the scalar curvature of formula 4 and formula 9 is the volume density associated to the metric formula 4 the exponent in the denominator is chosen so that the functional is scale invariant for every positive real constant formula 11 it satisfies formula 12 we may think of formula 13 as measuring the average scalar curvature of formula 4 over formula 1 it was conjectured by yamabe that every conformal class of metrics contains a metric of constant scalar curvature the so called yamabe problem it was proven by yamabe trudinger aubin and schoen that a minimum value of formula 13 is attained in each conformal class of metrics and in particular this minimum is achieved by a metric of constant scalar curvature we define where the infimum is taken over the smooth real valued functions formula 18 on formula 1

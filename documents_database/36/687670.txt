along with the family thrinaxodontidae and the large clade eucynodontia which includes the mammals it makes up the unranked taxon called epicynodontia galesaurids first appeared in the very latest permian period just a million years or perhaps only a thousand years before the greatest extinction of all time the permian triassic extinction event galesaurids are the most primitive of the epicynodontia they may have resembled the basal cynodonts such as the procynosuchidae and may have descended from a procynosuchid like ancestor but the galesaurids were more advanced than the basal cynodontia it is clear that like many other epicynodontians many galesaurids had a complete secondary palate which allowed them to swallow food while breathing and the dentary bone was enlarged relative to those of their ancestors their temporal fenestrae are much larger than those of the procynosuchids but not as large as in more advanced epicynodontians their snouts are broad rather than tall and they may have walked erect with the legs beneath the body like most other cynodontians galesaurid fossils are found almost worldwide they were among the survivors of the permian triassic extinction event but they became extinct in the middle triassic epoch as did the therocephalians genera

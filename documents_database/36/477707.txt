it is defined as the ratio of magnetomotive force mmf to magnetic flux it represents the opposition to magnetic flux and depends on the geometry and composition of an object magnetic reluctance in a magnetic circuit is analogous to electrical resistance in an electrical circuit in that resistance is a measure of the opposition to the electric current the definition of magnetic reluctance is analogous to ohm s law in this respect however magnetic flux passing through a reluctance does not give rise to dissipation of heat as it does for current through a resistance thus the analogy cannot be used for modelling energy flow in systems where energy crosses between the magnetic and electrical domains an alternative analogy to the reluctance model which does correctly represent energy flows is the gyrator capacitor model magnetic reluctance is a scalar extensive quantity akin to electrical resistance the unit for magnetic reluctance is inverse henry h the term reluctance was coined in may 1888 by oliver heaviside the notion of magnetic resistance was first mentioned by james joule in 1840 the idea for a magnetic flux law similar to ohm s law for closed electric circuits is attributed to henry augustus rowland

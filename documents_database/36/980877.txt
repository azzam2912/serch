normally there is one pair of connectors on a loudspeaker and a single cable two conductors runs from the amplifier output to the terminals at the loudspeaker housing from this point connections are made to the loudspeaker drivers usually through audio crossover networks in bi wiring each loudspeaker has two pairs of connectors and two cables are run from the same amplifier output to the speaker cabinet one for the high frequency or tweeter driver and one for the low frequency driver through two separated crossover filters the purported advantage of this split is that it reduces magnetic interaction in the cable resulting in better sound however technical analysis suggests that while bi wired arrangements may be expected to have differences from single wired ones these differences would normally be so small as to have little significance some audiophiles feel that bi wiring produces an audible improvement over standard single cabling for example john atkinson writing in stereophile states that he observes subtle but important differences particularly in reduction of treble hardness and improvement in bass control in one review critics of bi wiring believe that both ways of making speaker connections are electrically equivalent assuming no difference in speaker

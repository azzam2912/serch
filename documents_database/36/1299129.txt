like several other designs by richard vogt the p 194 featured an asymmetric arrangement the layout was broadly similar to that of the bv 141 the crew and weapons were carried in a large nacelle offset from the main fuselage structure that carried a propeller driven engine in the nose and the empennage at the rear joined together by a common wing however in the p 194 a turbojet was added low down at the rear of the crew nacelle and the thrust from this engine was intended to help balance the thrust from the propeller a powerful cluster of guns was to be located in the nose of the nacelle clear of the propeller and a bombload of up to 500 kg 1 100 lb was to be carried in an internal bomb bay in the fuselage using a high proportion of steel in its structure the design of the p 194 was simplified by using significant number of parts from other projects notably the bv 155 prototype and earlier bv 237 asymmetric stuka proposal

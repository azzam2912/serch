it has been investigated for its effect on ampa receptors chronic cx 614 treatments produce rapid increases in the synthesis of the brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf which has very important effects on synaptic plasticity and may have applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer s disease acute cx 614 treatments activate local mrna translation new protein synthesis within dendrites and this is mediated by a fast upregulation of bdnf release cx 614 dependent release of bdnf rapidly increases translation of proteins that are important for synaptic plasticity such as arc arg3 1 and camkiialpha cx 614 has also been proposed as a treatment for conditions such as depression and schizophrenia but produces receptor downregulation following chronic administration which might limit the potential for extended use however downregulation of ampa receptors with prolonged cx 614 administration can be avoided by designing and using short and intermittent treatment protocols which could still upregulate bdnf protein levels without reducing the levels of ampa receptors importantly such short and intermittent treatment protocols are neuroprotective against neurotoxicity induced with mptp and mpp in cultured midbrain mesencephalic and hippocampal organotypic slices these results uncovered the neuroprotective effects of cx 614 and indicated

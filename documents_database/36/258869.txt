instruction address space is 15 bit 32 kib maximum while data addresses are 8 bit 256 bytes maximum extended via bank switching to allow software bugs to be caught all invalid instruction addresses read as zero which is a trap instruction invalid ram above the stack reads as all ones which is an invalid address the cpu has an 8 bit accumulator and 15 bit pc 16 additional 8 bit registers r0 r15 and an 8 bit program status word are memory mapped there are special instructions to access them but general ram access instructions may also be used the memory map is as follows if ram is not banked then r15 s is just another general purpose register if ram is banked then the low half of the data address space addresses 0x00 7f is directed to a ram bank selected by s the special purpose registers in the high half of the data address space are always visible the data registers at 0xf x can be used to copy data between banks ram banks other than bank 0 have all 128 bytes available the stack addressed via the stack pointer is always on bank 0 no matter how

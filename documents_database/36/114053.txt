g dmt full rate adsl expands the usable bandwidth of existing copper telephone lines delivering high speed data communications at rates up to 8 mbit s downstream and 1 3 mbit s upstream dmt allocates from 2 to 15 bits per channel bin as line conditions change bit swapping allows the modem to swap bits around different channels without retraining as each channel becomes more or less capable if bit swapping is disabled then this does not happen and the modem needs to retrain in order to adapt to changing line conditions there are 2 competing standards for dmt adsl ansi and g dmt ansi t1 413 is a north american standard g 992 1 g dmt is an itu united nations telecom committee standard g dmt is used most commonly today throughout the world but the ansi standard was formerly popular in north america there is a difference in framing between the two and selecting the wrong standard can cause frame alignment errors every 5 or so minutes error correction is done using reed solomon encoding and further protection can be used if trellis encoding is used at both ends interleaving can also increase the robustness of the line

there are other ways to solve the quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula such as factoring completing the square graphing and others the general quadratic equation is here represents an unknown while and are constants with not equal to 0 one can verify that the quadratic formula satisfies the quadratic equation by inserting the former into the latter with the above parameterization the quadratic formula is the plus minus symbol indicates that the quadratic equation has two solutions each of these two solutions is called a root of the quadratic equation geometrically these roots represent the values at which any parabola explicitly given as crosses the axis as well as being a formula that will yield the zeros of any parabola the quadratic formula will give the axis of symmetry of the parabola and it can be used to immediately determine how many real zeros the quadratic equation has the quadratic formula may also be written as which may be simplified to this version of the formula is convenient when complex roots are accepted then the expression outside the square root will be the real part and the square root expression will be the imaginary part the expression

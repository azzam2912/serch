this function is achieved by preventing the formation of the divisome z ring around the poles when initially discovered in e coli minc was believed to form a stable cap by binding with mind at the bacterial caps in a stable and static manner thereby specifying the mid zone of the cell by lower concentration or lack of this complex in that region alleviating inhibition of z ring formation however raskin de boer applied live cell imaging with gfp fusion proteins to reveal a dynamic interaction of the min proteins demonstrating that minc and mind with the essential help of mine actually rapidly oscillate between the two poles in a non static manner minc is found in diverse genera including neisseria bacillus and synechocystis but is absent in an equally wide assortment of genera e g caulobacter mycobacterium many bacteria that lack minc carry alternative proteins that can position their z ring minc is known to dimerize and functions as an ftsz protein inhibitor antagonizing its structure assembly when in a high enough concentration the protein has the ability to disassemble the zapa zapb and zipa proteins which preferentially bind to the ftsz scaffold protein and which are needed to

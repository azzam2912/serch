the human lamp1 gene is located on the long arm q of chromosome 13 at region 3 band 4 13q34 lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 is a glycoprotein from a family of lysosome associated membrane glycoproteins the lamp 1 glycoprotein is a type i transmembrane protein which is expressed at high or medium levels in at least 76 different normal tissue cell types it resides primarily across lysosomal membranes and functions to provide selectins with carbohydrate ligands cd107a has also been shown to be a marker of degranulation on lymphocytes such as cd8 and nk cells and may also play a role in tumor cell differentiation and metastasis residing primarily across lysosomal membranes these glycoproteins consist of a large highly glycosylated end with n linked carbon chains on the luminal side of the membrane and a short c terminal tail exposed to the cytoplasm the extracytoplasmic region contains a hinge like structure which can form disulphide bridges homologous to those observed in human immunoglobulin a other characteristics of the structure of the lamp 1 glycoproteins include lamp1 and lamp2 glycoproteins comprise 50 of all lysosomal membrane proteins and are thought to be responsible in part for maintaining lysosomal integrity ph

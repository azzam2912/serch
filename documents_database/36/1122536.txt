there are two such external tangent lines for any two circles each such pair has a unique intersection point in the extended euclidean plane monge s theorem states that the three such points given by the three pairs of circles always lie in a straight line in the case of two of the circles being of equal size the two external tangent lines are parallel in this case monge s theorem asserts that the other two intersection points must lie on a line parallel to those two external tangents in other words if the two external tangents are considered to intersect at the point at infinity then the other two intersection points must be on a line passing through the same point at infinity so the line between them takes the same angle as the external tangent the simplest proof employs a three dimensional analogy let the three circles correspond to three spheres of the same radii the circles correspond to the equators that result from a plane passing through the centers of the spheres the three spheres can be sandwiched uniquely between two planes each pair of spheres defines a cone that is externally tangent to both spheres and

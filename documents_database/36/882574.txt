advanced users often rely on those counters to conduct low level performance analysis or tuning the number of available hardware counters in a processor is limited while each cpu model might have a lot of different events that a developer might like to measure each counter can be programmed with the index of an event type to be monitored like a l1 cache miss or a branch misprediction one of the first processors to implement such counter and an associated instruction codice 1 to access it was the intel pentium but they were not documented until terje mathisen wrote an article about reverse engineering them in byte july 1994 the following table shows some examples of cpus and the number of available hardware counters compared to software profilers hardware counters provide low overhead access to a wealth of detailed performance information related to cpu s functional units caches and main memory etc another benefit of using them is that no source code modifications are needed in general however the types and meanings of hardware counters vary from one kind of architecture to another due to the variation in hardware organizations there can be difficulties correlating the low level performance metrics

the term synchronous refers here to the fact that the rotor and magnetic field rotate with the same speed because the magnetic field is generated through a shaft mounted permanent magnet mechanism and current is induced into the stationary armature synchronous generators are the majority source of commercial electrical energy they are commonly used to convert the mechanical power output of steam turbines gas turbines reciprocating engines and hydro turbines into electrical power for the grid some designs of wind turbines also use this generator type in the majority of designs the rotating assembly in the center of the generator the rotor contains the magnet and the stator is the stationary armature that is electrically connected to a load as shown in the diagram the perpendicular component of the stator field affects the torque while the parallel component affects the voltage the load supplied by the generator determines the voltage if the load is inductive then the angle between the rotor and stator fields will be greater than 90 degrees which corresponds to an increased generator voltage this is known as an overexcited generator the opposite is true for a generator supplying a capacitive load which is known as an

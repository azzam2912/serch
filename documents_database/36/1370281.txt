the condition involves the hardening of a lymph vessel connected to a vein in the penis it can look like a thick cord and can feel like a hardened almost calcified or fibrous vein it tends to not share the common blue tint with a vein however it can be felt as a hardened lump or vein even when the penis is flaccid and is even more prominent during an erection this disorder is fairly common and most often occurs after vigorous sexual activity and resolves spontaneously etiology of sclerosing lymphangitis is unknown but has been postulated to be secondary to thrombosis of lymphatic vessels in most cases it tends to go away if given rest and more gentle care for example by use of lubricants even without rest or gentle care in some cases it will simply disappear after a few weeks on its own spontaneous recovery can occur anywhere within a couple weeks to several months although it is commonly recommended the patient abstain from sexual activity during recovery there is no evidence that this expedites resolution or that engaging in sexual activity worsens the condition

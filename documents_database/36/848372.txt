it is a combined pci and isa slot it was developed to provide a cost efficient solution to a complete multimedia system using media bus cards for building a system reduced slot requirements and compatibility problems expansion cards supporting this interface were only manufactured by asus for a very limited time this bus is now obsolete while similar to pci x in appearance the extension contains 4 additional pins 2 on each side for a total of 68 the divider between the pci slot and media bus extension is too wide to support a properly keyed pci x card despite the very short lifespan there were at least two revisions of asus media bus revision 1 2 and 2 0 the difference between them is that the latter revision has 72 pins instead of 68 so it does not have to use any pci slot signals reserved for pci cards and pci slot shared with the media bus slot becomes standards compliant the gap between pci slot and media bus extension is 0 32 in for revision 1 2 pictured and 0 4 in for revision 2 0 so expansion cards designed for two revisions are mutually incompatible expansion cards

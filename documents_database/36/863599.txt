one method of disproof is the use of scherk surfaces as used by harold rosenberg and pascal collin 2006 let formula 1 be the complex plane considered as a riemannian manifold with its usual flat riemannian metric let formula 2 denote the hyperbolic plane i e the unit disc endowed with the hyperbolic metric e heinz proved in 1952 that there can exist no harmonic diffeomorphism in light of this theorem schoen conjectured that there exists no harmonic diffeomorphism it is not clear how yau s name became associated with the conjecture in unpublished correspondence with harold rosenberg both schoen and yau identify schoen as having postulated the conjecture the schoen yau conjecture has since been disproved the emphasis is on the existence or non existence of an harmonic diffeomorphism and that this property is a one way property in more detail suppose that we consider two riemannian manifolds m and n with their respective metrics and write if there exists a diffeomorphism from m onto n in the usual terminology m and n are diffeomorphic write if there exists an harmonic diffeomorphism from m onto n it is not difficult to show that formula 9 being diffeomorphic is an

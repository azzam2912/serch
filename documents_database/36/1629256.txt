the aim is to make foreign constructions salient and transparent to learners and in many cases spare them the technical jargon of grammatical analysis it differs from literal translation and interlinear text as used in the past since it takes the progress learners have made into account and only focuses upon one specific structure at a time as a didactic device it can only be used to the extent that it remains intelligible to the learner unless it is combined with a normal idiomatic translation compounds can be broken down into their component parts to help learners understand their logic for example in german so loanword is originally an exact copy of the german compound or calque the term mother tongue mirroring can itself be regarded as a calque from german because it is originally a translation of muttersprachliche spiegelung over and above knowing what idioms actually mean in order to use them properly learners want to know how they come to mean what they mean in another example from german in french in turkish in armenian in german mother tongue mirroring is most helpful for discovering the hidden anatomy of foreign grammars especially of non related languages in mandarin

motion detection can be achieved by either mechanical or electronic methods when motion detection is accomplished by natural organisms it is called motion perception motion can be detected by the most basic form of mechanical motion detection is in the form of a switch or trigger for example the keys of a typewriter employ a mechanical method of detecting motion each key is a manual switch that is either off or on each letter that appears is a result of motion on that corresponding key and the switch being turned on the principal methods by which motion can be electronically identified are optical detection and acoustic detection infrared light or laser technology may be used for optical detection motion detection devices such as pir motion detectors have a sensor that detects a disturbance in the infrared spectrum once detected a signal can activate an alarm or a camera that can capture an image or video of the motioner the chief applications for such detection are detection of unauthorized entry detection of cessation of occupancy of an area to extinguish lighting and detection of a moving object which triggers a camera to record subsequent events a simple algorithm for motion detection

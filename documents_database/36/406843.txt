the insert is purified in order to isolate it from other dna molecules a common purification method is gel isolation the number of copies of the gene is then amplified using polymerase chain reaction pcr simultaneously the same restriction enzymes are used to digest cut the destination the idea behind using the same restriction enzymes is to create complementary sticky ends which will facilitate ligation later on a phosphatase commonly calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ciap is also added to prevent self ligation of the destination vector the digested destination vector is isolated purified the insert and the destination vector are then mixed together with dna ligase a typical molar ratio of insert genes to destination vectors is 3 1 by increasing the insert concentration self ligation is further decreased after letting the reaction mixture sit for a set amount of time at a specific temperature dependent upon the size of the strands being ligated for more information see dna ligase the insert should become successfully incorporated into the destination plasmid the plasmid is often transformed into a bacterium like e coli ideally when the bacterium divides the plasmid should also be replicated in the best case scenario each bacterial cell

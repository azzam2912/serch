the systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl coa 3 methyl 2 oxobutanoate c acetyltransferase thioester hydrolysing carboxymethyl forming other names in common use include 3 carboxy 3 hydroxy 4 methylpentanoate 3 methyl 2 oxobutanoate lyase coa acetylating alpha isopropylmalate synthetase alpha isopropylmalate synthase alpha isopropylmalic synthetase isopropylmalate synthase and isopropylmalate synthetase this enzyme participates in biosynthesis of leucine and pyruvate metabolism monovalent and divalent cation activation have been reported for enzymes from different sources mycobacterium tuberculosis isopropylmalate synthase requires a divalent metal ion of which mg and mn give highest activity and a monovalent cation with k as the best activator zn was shown to be an inhibitor contrary to what was assumed from the structural data in addition to the complex requirements for a divalent metal and further activation by k m tuberculosis isopropylmalate synthase follows a random kinetic mechanism for catalysis another feature of the m tuberculosis homolog is that leucine the feedback inhibitor inhibits the enzyme in a time dependent fashion this was the first demonstration of a feedback inhibitor that displays slow onset inhibition as of late 2007 only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes with the pdb accession code

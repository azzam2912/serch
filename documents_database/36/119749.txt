they are very common due to their low cost but high durability greater than 1 million cycles and up to 10 million cycles for heavy duty models this durability is a natural consequence of the design the defining feature of micro switches is that a relatively small movement at the actuator button produces a relatively large movement at the electrical contacts which occurs at high speed regardless of the speed of actuation most successful designs also exhibit hysteresis meaning that a small reversal of the actuator is insufficient to reverse the contacts there must be a significant movement in the opposite direction both of these characteristics help to achieve a clean and reliable interruption to the switched circuit the first micro switch was invented by phillip kenneth mcgall in 1932 in freeport illinois patent 1 960 020 mcgall was an employee of the burgess battery company at the time in 1937 w b schulte mcgall s employer started the company micro switch the company and the micro switch trademark has been owned by honeywell sensing and control since 1950 the name has become a generic trademark for any snap action switch companies other than honeywell now manufacture miniature snap action

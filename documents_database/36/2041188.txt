they can function as principal spillways emergency spillways or both they can be located on the dam itself or on a natural grade in the vicinity of the dam chute spillways carry supercritical flow through the steep slope of an open channel there are four main components of a chute spillway the elements of a spillway are the inlet the vertical curve section ogee curve the steep sloped channel and the outlet in order to avoid a hydraulic jump the slope of the spillway must be steep enough for the flow to remain supercritical proper spillways help with flood control prevent erosion at the ends of terraces outlets and waterways reduce runoff over drainage ditch banks and are simple to construct however they can only be constructed at sites with natural drainage and moderate temperature variation and have a shorter life expectancy than other spillways stepped spillways are used to dissipate energy along the chute of the channel the steps of the spillway greatly reduce the kinetic energy of the flow and therefore reduce flow velocity roller compacted concrete rcc stepped spillways have become increasingly popular because of their use in rehabilitating aged flood control dams design guidelines for these

the higher the fill power the more air a certain weight of the down can trap and thus the more insulating ability the down will have fill power ranges from about 300 in oz or 175 cm g or lorch 75 mm 30g for feathers to around 900 in oz or 520 cm g or lorch 225 mm 30g for the highest quality goose down the rare and relatively expensive down of certain wild waterfowl species such as the muscovy duck or common eider can have higher fill powers than goose down higher fill powers are associated with a larger percentage of down clusters and a larger average down cluster size fill power is the most frequently used measure of down quality it involves measurements taken of a 20g or one ounce sample of down in a plexiglas cylinder with a weighted piston compressing the down the test requires controlled temperature humidity and preparation of the sample all other things being equal bedding or garments made with high fill power down is lighter and more compressible than an equally warm one made with lower quality down fill power can be expressed as cubic inches per ounce in oz for down

thus rel contains its opposite and is self dual the involution represented by taking the converse relation provides the dagger to make rel a dagger category the category has two functors into itself given by the hom functor a binary relation r a b and its transpose r b a may be composed either as r r or as r r the first composition results in a homogeneous relation on a and the second is on b since the images of these hom functors are in rel itself in this case hom is an internal hom functor with its internal hom functor rel is a closed category and furthermore a dagger compact category the category rel can be obtained from the category set as the kleisli category for the monad whose functor corresponds to power set interpreted as a covariant functor perhaps a bit surprising at first sight is the fact that product in rel is given by the disjoint union rather than the cartesian product as it is in set and so is the coproduct rel is monoidal closed with both the monoidal product a b and the internal hom a b given by cartesian product of sets the

of course the embedding is surely possible set theoretically but the emphasis is on the effectiveness of the functions manipulating such representations of sequences the operations on sequences accessing individual members concatenation can be implemented using total recursive functions and in fact by primitive recursive functions it is usually used to build sequential data types in the realm of arithmetic based formalizations of some fundamental notions of mathematics it is a specific case of the more general idea of g del numbering for example recursive function theory can be regarded as a formalization of the notion of an algorithm and if we regard it as a programming language we can mimic lists by encoding a sequence of natural numbers in a single natural number to achieve this we can use various number theoretic ideas using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is a straightforward way but there are also more economic approaches such as using the pairing function combined with the chinese remainder theorem in a sophisticated way besides using g del numbering to encode unique sequences of symbols into unique natural numbers i e place numbers into mutually exclusive or one to one correspondence with the sequences we can use

such language forms usually consist of special data types like vector matrix color and normal due to the variety of target markets for 3d computer graphics different shading languages have been developed shading languages used in offline rendering produce maximum image quality material properties are totally abstracted little programming skill and no hardware knowledge is required these kind of shaders are often developed by artists to get the right look just as texture mapping lighting and other facets of their work processing such shaders is time consuming the computational power required can be expensive because of their ability to produce photorealistic results most of the time production rendering is run on large computer clusters the renderman shading language often referenced as rsl or sl for short which is defined in the renderman interface specification is the most common shading language for production quality rendering it is also one of the first shading languages ever implemented the language defines six major shader types houdini vex vector expressions shading language often abbreviated to vex is closely modeled after renderman however its integration into a complete 3d package means that the shader writer can access the information inside the shader a feature that

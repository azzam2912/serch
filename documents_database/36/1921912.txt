this gene produces 2 isoforms through alternative splicing phactr1 is a member of the phosphatase and actin regulator family and contains 4 rpel repeats three of which reside at the c terminal and bind three actin monomers phactr1 binds actin and pp1 in the region containing these rpel repeats as a phactr protein phactr1 differs from other pp1 binding proteins in that it is missing the r k r k hydrophobic x f w consensus sequence indicating that it binds pp1 at a different site phactr1 is also predicted to contain 8 pka phosphorylation sites and 7 pkc phosphorylation sites found near the rpel repeats phactr1 is a pp1 binding protein which is reported to be highly expressed in brain and which controls pp1 activity and f actin remodeling phactr1 can be induced by nrp and vegf through nrp 1 and vegf r1 receptors to control tubulogenesis actin polymerization and lamellipodial dynamics through this function phactr1 is suggested to play a role in cell motility and vascular morphogenesis meanwhile suppression of phactr1 increases expression of death cell receptors leading to extrinsic apoptosis the phactr1 locus is commonly identified in multiple genome wide association studies investigating coronary artery disease and myocardial

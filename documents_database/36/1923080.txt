chemical chaperones are a broad and diverse group of molecules and they can influence protein stability and polypeptide organization through a variety of mechanisms chemical chaperones are used for a range of applications from production of recombinant proteins to treatment of protein misfolding in vivo there are many different small molecules that can function to enhance protein stability and folding many of them can be broadly grouped into large classes based both on their structure and their proposed mechanism of action the parameters that define these groups are not strictly defined and many small molecules that exert a chemical chaperoning effect do not readily fall into one of these categories for example the free amino acid arginine is not classically defined as a chemical chaperone but it has a well documented anti aggregation effect cellular osmolytes are polar small molecules that are synthesized or taken up by cells to maintain the integrity of cellular components during periods of osmotic or other forms of stress osmolytes are diverse in chemical structure and include polyols sugars methylamines and free amino acids and their derivatives examples of these include glycerol trehalose trimethylamine n oxide tmao and glycine despite being most active at relatively

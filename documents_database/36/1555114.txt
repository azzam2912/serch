they occur as secondary metabolites primarily in genera of the nightshade family for example in the tomatillo structurally withanolides consist of a steroid backbone bound to a lactone or one of its derivatives they are produced via oxidation of steroids it remains unknown to what end withanolides are produced they may act as a deterrent for feeding insect larvae and other herbivores in the laboratory many withanolides have exhibited medicinally interesting properties genera within the nightshade family that have been found to produce withanolides include acnistus datura dunalia iochroma lycium nicandra physalis salpichroa solanum withania and jaborosa this class of steroidal lactones involves an ergostane type framework in which c 22 and c 26 are appropriately oxidised to form a delta lactone ring they are subdivided into nine groups withanolides withaphysalins physalins nicandrenones jaborols ixocarpalactones perulactones acnistins and miscellaneous withasteroids withaferin a the first withanolide to be isolated was found in winter cherry withania somnifera also known as ashwagandha in ayurvedic medicine the anti inflammatory effects of a few dozen known withanolides have been demonstrated in animal experiments withaferin a acts as an anti angiogenic compound by inhibiting transcription factors sp1 and nf b withaferin a down regulates angiogenic switch

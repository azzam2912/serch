in this model the wing vorticity is modelled by a bound vortex of constant circulation travelling with the wing and two trailing wingtip vortices therefore having a shape vaguely reminiscent of a horseshoe a starting vortex is shed as the wing begins to move through the fluid which dissipates under the action of viscosity as do the trailing vortices far behind the aircraft the trailing wingtip vortices are responsible for the component of the downwash which creates induced drag the horseshoe vortex model is unrealistic in that it implies uniform circulation and hence according to the kutta joukowski theorem uniform lift at all sections on the wingspan in a more realistic model the lifting line theory the vortex strength varies along the wingspan and the loss in vortex strength is shed as a vortex sheet all along the trailing edge rather than as a single trail at the wing tips nevertheless the simpler horseshoe vortex model used with a reduced effective wingspan but same mid plane circulation provides an adequate model for the flows induced far from the aircraft the term horseshoe vortex is also used in wind engineering to describe the flow pattern created by strong winds around the

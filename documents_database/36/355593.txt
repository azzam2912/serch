1 kelvin pot is a cryogenic device used to attain temperatures down to approximately 1 kelvin the 1 k pot is a small vessel in a cryogenic system that is filled with liquid helium usually it is a few cubic centimeters in size with a pickup tube extending into the primary liquid helium bath of the dewar when a vessel containing liquid helium is connected to a vacuum pump the vapor pressure above the liquid surface drops thereby allowing the more energetic helium molecules to evaporate out of the liquid as the particles evaporate and are pumped away from the liquid they carry heat energy with them so the remaining fluid tends to cool this technique is known as evaporative cooling at atmospheric pressure he the more abundant isotope of helium liquefies at 4 2 k by employing evaporative cooling temperatures down to 1 k can be easily produced while this technique is fairly simple to operate it is inefficient for large helium baths because about 50 of the liquid helium must evaporate to attain to the lowest temperatures if only a small volume needs to be cooled to 1 k the 1 k pot is used only the surface

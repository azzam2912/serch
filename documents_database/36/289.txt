it was first described in 1837 as the successor to babbage s difference engine a design for a simpler mechanical computer the analytical engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops and integrated memory making it the first design for a general purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as turing complete in other words the logical structure of the analytical engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era the analytical engine is one of the most successful achievements of charles babbage babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding it was not until 1941 that the first general purpose computer z3 was actually built more than a century after babbage had proposed the pioneering analytical engine in 1837 babbage s first attempt at a mechanical computing device the difference engine was a special purpose machine designed to tabulate logarithms and trigonometric functions by evaluating finite differences to create approximating polynomials construction of this machine was never completed babbage had conflicts with his chief engineer joseph clement and

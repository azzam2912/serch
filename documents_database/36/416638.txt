it is found on n linked glycans on the mammalian insect and plant cell surface fucose is the fundamental sub unit of the seaweed polysaccharide fucoidan the 1 3 linked core of fucose is a suspected carbohydrate antigen for ige mediated allergy two structural features distinguish fucose from other six carbon sugars present in mammals the lack of a hydroxyl group on the carbon at the 6 position c 6 thereby making it a deoxy sugar and the configuration it is equivalent to 6 deoxy galactose in the fucose containing glycan structures fucosylated glycans fucose can exist as a terminal modification or serve as an attachment point for adding other sugars in human n linked glycans fucose is most commonly linked 1 6 to the reducing terminal n acetylglucosamine however fucose at the non reducing termini linked 1 2 to galactose forms the h antigen the substructure of the a and b blood group antigens fucose is released from fucose containing polymers by an enzyme called fucosidase found in lysosomes fucose has several potential applications in cosmetics pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements fucosylation of antibodies has been established to reduce binding to the fc receptor of natural killer cells and thereby

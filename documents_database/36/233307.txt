especially ncl is the most powerful ligation method for synthesizing native backbone proteins or modified proteins of moderate size i e small proteinsthiol group of an n terminal cysteine residue of an unprotected peptide 2 attacks the c terminal thioester of a second unprotected peptide 1 in an aqueous buffer at ph 7 0 20 cacyl shift that results in the formation of a native amide peptide bond 4 at the ligation site scheme 1 remarks ncl reaction is catalyzed by in situ transthioesterification with thiol additives the most common thiol catalysts to date have been either a mixture of thiophenyl 4 mercaptophenylacetic acid mpaa or 2 mercaptoethanesulfonate mesna ref the main property of the ncl method is the reversibility of the first step the thiol ate thioester exchange reaction native chemical ligation is exquisitely regioselective because that thiol ate thioester exchange step is freely reversible in the presence of an exogenous thiol added as catalyst the high yields of final ligation product obtained even in the presence of internal cys residues in either both segments is the result of the irreversibility under the reaction conditions used of the second s to n acyl shift amide forming step no side

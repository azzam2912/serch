the source is located between the constellations pisces and aries a direction in which no stars are observed within 1000 light years from earth it is also a very weak signal the frequency of the signal has a rapid drift changing by between 8 and 37 hertz per second if the cause is doppler shift it would indicate emission from a planet rotating nearly 40 times faster on its axis than the earth each time the signal was detected it was again at about 1420 mhz the original frequency before any drift there are a number of potential explanations for this signal seti home has denied media reports of a likely extraterrestrial intelligence signal it could be an artifact of random chance cosmic noise or even a glitch in the technology the region is unusually devoid of any nearby stars the closest star systems in the approximate region of the signal include the binary star g 73 11a and b which are 106 1 light years from the sun although the unrelated star g 73 10 is only 108 7 light years away less than three light years from g 73 11a and b all of these stars are red

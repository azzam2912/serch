polymer physics and polymer chemistry are also related with the field of polymer science where this is considered the applicative part of polymers polymers are large molecules and thus are very complicated for solving using a deterministic method yet statistical approaches can yield results and are often pertinent since large polymers i e polymers with many monomers are describable efficiently in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many monomers although the actual size is clearly finite thermal fluctuations continuously affect the shape of polymers in liquid solutions and modeling their effect requires using principles from statistical mechanics and dynamics as a corollary temperature strongly affects the physical behavior of polymers in solution causing phase transitions melts and so on the statistical approach for polymer physics is based on an analogy between a polymer and either a brownian motion or other type of a random walk the self avoiding walk the simplest possible polymer model is presented by the ideal chain corresponding to a simple random walk experimental approaches for characterizing polymers are also common using polymer characterization methods such as size exclusion chromatography viscometry dynamic light scattering and automatic continuous online monitoring of polymerization reactions acomp for determining the chemical physical

by classical physics there is almost no possibility for protons to fuse by crossing each other s coulomb barrier at temperatures commonly observed to cause fusion such as those found in the sun when george gamow instead applied quantum mechanics to the problem he found that there was a significant chance for the fusion due to tunneling the probability of two nuclear particles overcoming their electrostatic barriers is given by the following equation where formula 2 is the gamow energy here formula 4 is the reduced mass of the two particles the constant formula 5 is the fine structure constant formula 6 is the speed of light and formula 7 and formula 8 are the respective atomic numbers of each particle while the probability of overcoming the coulomb barrier increases rapidly with increasing particle energy for a given temperature the probability of a particle having such an energy falls off very fast as described by the maxwell boltzmann distribution gamow found that taken together these effects mean that for any given temperature the particles that fuse are mostly in a temperature dependent narrow range of energies known as the gamow window gamow first solved the one dimensional case of quantum

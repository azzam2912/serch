lorentz in the 1950s are generalisations of the more familiar formula 1 spaces the lorentz spaces are denoted by formula 2 like the formula 1 spaces they are characterized by a norm technically a quasinorm that encodes information about the size of a function just as the formula 1 norm does the two basic qualitative notions of size of a function are how tall is the graph of the function and how spread out is it the lorentz norms provide tighter control over both qualities than the formula 1 norms by exponentially rescaling the measure in both the range formula 6 and the domain formula 7 the lorentz norms like the formula 1 norms are invariant under arbitrary rearrangements of the values of a function the lorentz space on a measure space formula 9 is the space of complex valued measurable functions formula 10 on x such that the following quasinorm is finite where formula 12 and formula 13 thus when formula 14 and when formula 16 it is also conventional to set formula 18 the quasinorm is invariant under rearranging the values of the function formula 10 essentially by definition in particular given a complex valued measurable function formula

currently manufactured by thalesraytheonsystems the system is a long range version of weapon locating radar designed to detect and track incoming artillery and rocket fire to determine the point of origin for counter battery fire it is currently in service at brigade and higher levels in the united states army and by other countries the radar is trailer mounted and towed by a 2 ton truck a typical an tpq 37 system consists of the antenna transceiver group command shelter and 60 kw generator the an tpq 37 is an electronically steered radar meaning the radar does not actually move while in operation the radar scans a 90 degree sector for incoming rocket artillery and mortar fire upon detecting a possible incoming round the system verifies the contact before initiating a track sequence continuing to search for new targets the incoming round rocket is tracked during its initial upward launch trajectory i e the linear portion of its flight path prior to reaching apogee a computer program analyzes the track data and then extrapolates the round s point of origin this calculated point of origin is then reported to the operator with map coordinates thus allowing friendly artillery to direct

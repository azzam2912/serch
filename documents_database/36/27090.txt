blood plasma hemolysis may occur in vivo or in vitro inside or outside the body one cause of hemolysis is the action of hemolysins toxins that are produced by certain pathogenic bacteria or fungi another cause is intense physical exercise hemolysins damage the red blood cell s cytoplasmic membrane causing lysis and eventually cell death hemolysis inside the body can be caused by a large number of medical conditions including many gram positive bacteria e g streptococcus enterococcus and staphylococcus some parasites e g plasmodium some autoimmune disorders e g drug induced hemolytic anemia some genetic disorders e g sickle cell disease or g6pd deficiency or blood with too low a solute concentration hypotonic to cells hemolysis can lead to hemoglobinemia due to hemoglobin released into the blood plasma which plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and can lead to increased risk of infection due to its inhibitory effects on the innate immune system many species of the genus streptococcus cause hemolysis streptococcal bacteria species are classified according to their hemolytic properties note that these hemolytic properties are not necessarily present in vivo the genus enterococcus includes lactic acid bacteria formerly classified as gamma hemolytic group d

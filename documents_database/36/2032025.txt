the sequence of strata from both periods consists of a variety of sandstones mudstones siltstones and limestones these sediments were deposited within the hampshire and weald basins erosion subsequent to large scale but gentle folding associated with the alpine orogeny has resulted in the present outcrop pattern across the county dominated by the north facing chalk scarp of the south downs the bedrock is overlain by a suite of quaternary deposits of varied origin parts of both the bedrock and these superficial deposits have been worked for a variety of minerals for use in construction industry and agriculture a sequence of sedimentary rocks of jurassic age has been proved to underlie the cretaceous succession but nowhere within the county does it appear at the surface beneath these again boreholes have proven devonian and carboniferous rocks and possible permo triassic strata the lower cretaceous comprises a sequence of stratigraphic groups from the purbeck group through the wealden and lower greensand groups to the selborne group the lowermost earliest of these are present at depth but do not outcrop at the surface the oldest strata to outcrop at the surface within west sussex are the sandstones and siltstones of the ashdown formation

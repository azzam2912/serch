the layer of the atmosphere in which they exist is known as the junge layer or simply the stratospheric aerosol layer these particles consist of a mixture of sulfuric acid and water they are created naturally such as by photochemical decomposition of sulfur containing gases e g carbonyl sulfide when present in high levels e g after a strong volcanic eruption such as mount pinatubo they produce a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight and by modifying clouds as they fall out of the stratosphere this cooling may persist for a few years before the particles fall out an aerosol is a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in a gas the sulfate particles or sulfuric acid droplets in the atmosphere are about 0 1 to 1 0 micrometer a millionth of a meter in diameter sulfur aerosols are common in the troposphere as a result of pollution with sulfur dioxide from burning coal and from natural processes volcanos are a major source of particles in the stratosphere as the force of the volcanic eruption propels sulfur containing gases into the stratosphere the relative influence of volcanoes on the junge layer varies considerably according to the number and size

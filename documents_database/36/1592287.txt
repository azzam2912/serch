roshek professor of physics applied physics and bioengineering at the california institute of technology caltech roukes earned b a degrees in physics and chemistry double majors in 1978 at university of california santa cruz with highest honors in both majors he received his ph d in physics from cornell university in 1985 his graduate advisor at cornell was nobel laureate robert coleman richardson roukes thesis research at cornell elucidated the electron phonon bottleneck at ultra low temperatures the hot electron effect that is now recapitulated in texts on solid state transport physics stated in simplest terms when electrons carry current in normal conductors they heat up at low temperatures and now in nanoscale devices at ordinary temperatures their ability to dissipate this heat can be significantly impaired this has generic implications for the operation of powered nanodevices after earning his ph d roukes spent seven years as a member of technical staff principal investigator in the quantum structures research group at bell communications research in new jersey focusing on mesoscopic physics of electron transport in nanostructures roukes left bellcore to become a tenured associate professor of physics at caltech in 1992 rising to full professorship in 1995 and subsequently became

these linkages are rare compared to four bar and six bar linkages but two well known examples are the peaucellier linkage and the linkage designed by theo jansen for his walking machines eight bar linkages are classified by how many binary ternary and quaternary links they have a binary link connects two joints a ternary link connects three joints and a quaternary link connects four joints there are three classes of eight bar linkage denoted 4 4 0 0 5 2 1 0 and 6 0 2 0 distinguished by the count of binary ternary and quaternary links when read from left to right the final zero is traditionally added to the class label though no eight bar linkage has a quintanary link there are sixteen different topologies of eight bar linkages which are distinguished by their non isomorphic linkage graphs of these 16 topologies nine are in class 4 4 0 0 five are in 5 2 1 0 and two in 6 0 2 0 the peaucellier linkage or peaucellier lipkin cell or peaucellier lipkin inversor is an eight bar linkage constructed from hinged joints that traces a pure straight line from a rotary input it is named

therefore a bright red can be represented as r g b 255 0 0 while a dark red may be 40 0 0 in the normalized rgb space or rg space a color is represented by the proportion of red green and blue in the color rather than by the intensity of each since these proportions must always add up to a total of 1 we are able to quote just the red and green proportions of the color and can calculate the blue value if necessary given a color r g b where r g b intensity of red green and blue this can be converted to color formula 1 where formula 2 imply the proportion of red green and blue in the original color formula 3 formula 4 formula 5 formula 6 the sum of rgb will always equal one because of this property the b dimension can be thrown away without causing any loss in information the reverse conversion is not possible with only two dimensions as the intensity information is lost during the conversion to rg chromaticity e g 1 3 1 3 1 3 has equal proportions of each color but it is not possible

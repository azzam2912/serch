however selection of methicillin depended on the outcome of susceptibility testing of the sampled infection and since it is no longer produced it is also not routinely tested for any more it also served a purpose in the laboratory to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of staphylococcus aureus to other penicillins facing lactam resistance this role has now been passed on to other penicillins namely cloxacillin as well as genetic testing for the presence of meca gene by pcr at one time methicillin was used to treat infections caused by certain gram positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus staphylococcus epidermidis streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae methicillin is no longer effective against these organisms due to resistance resistance to methicillin is conferred by activation of a new bacterial penicillin binding protein pbp meca gene this encodes protein pbp2a pbp2a works in a similar manner to other pbps but it binds lactams with very low affinity meaning they do not compete efficiently with the natural substrate of the enzyme and will not inhibit cell wall biosynthesis expression of pbpa2 confers resistance to all lactams these susceptibility data are given on a few medically significant bacteria like other beta lactam antibiotics methicillin acts by inhibiting

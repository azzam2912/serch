it is a bright yellow solid it is widely used as visible light photo catalyst with a narrow band gap of less than 2 4 ev it is a representative of complex inorganic colored pigments or cicps more specifically bismuth vanadate is a mixed metal oxide bismuth vanadate is also known under the colour index international as c i pigment yellow 184 it occurs naturally as the rare minerals pucherite clinobisvanite and dreyerite bismuth vanadate is a bright yellow powder and may have a slight green tint when used as a pigment it contains a high chroma and excellent hiding power in nature bismuth vanadate can be found as the mineral pucherite clinobisvanite and dreyerite depending on the particular polymorph formed its synthesis was first recorded in a pharmaceutical patent in 1924 and began to be used readily as a pigment in the mid 1980s today it is manufactured across the world for pigment use most commercial bismuth vanadate pigments are now based on pure bismuth vanadate with monoclinic clinobisvanite or tetragonal dreyerite structure though in the past two phase systems involving a 4 3 relationship between bismuth vanadate and bismuth molybdate bimoo have been used in the monoclinic phase

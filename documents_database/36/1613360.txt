three proteins that interact with a fragment of the pam cytosolic domain containing signaling switch i and ii the ra1 and ra2ras complex rassf7 the first member of the n terminal rassf family is required for mitosis rassf9 is recently found to be involved in regulation of epidermal homeostasis the mutant proregion encoding pam cooh terminal interactor protein 1 p cip1 is comparable to that of human band 4 1 like tf blood plasma protein as a recycling endosomal pathway in microtubule locations does not bind rasgtp specificity of interaction may all be related to microtubule locations of the endosomal lysosomal system localized within the centrosome with transferrin and different ras proteins or with that one n ras but on the other hand it interacts with three ha ras ki ras and rap residues function blocked by a mutation that affects ras effector function is the critical product of the t 6 11 abnormality associated with some human leukemias phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase make contacts with both 6 11 switch i and ii regions of ras and yeast adenylyl cyclase molecules carrying these mutations are rendered unactivatable by ras in vitro ras interacting residues are appreciably different from that of ralgds

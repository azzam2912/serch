according to the theorem once the spatial distribution of the electrons has been determined by solving the schr dinger equation all the forces in the system can be calculated using classical electrostatics the theorem has been proven independently by many authors including paul g ttinger 1932 wolfgang pauli 1933 hans hellmann 1937 and richard feynman 1939 the theorem states where this proof of the hellmann feynman theorem requires that the wavefunction be an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian under consideration however one can also prove more generally that the theorem holds for non eigenfunction wavefunctions which are stationary partial derivative is zero for all relevant variables such as orbital rotations the hartree fock wavefunction is an important example of an approximate eigenfunction that still satisfies the hellmann feynman theorem notable example of where the hellmann feynman is not applicable is for example finite order m ller plesset perturbation theory which is not variational the proof also employs an identity of normalized wavefunctions that derivatives of the overlap of a wavefunction with itself must be zero using dirac s bra ket notation these two conditions are written as the proof then follows through an application of the derivative product rule to the

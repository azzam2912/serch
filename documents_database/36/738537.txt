such entities correspond to the mathematical notion of a sparse matrix eav is also known as object attribute value model vertical database model and open schema this data representation is analogous to space efficient methods of storing a sparse matrix where only non empty values are stored in an eav data model each attribute value pair is a fact describing an entity and a row in an eav table stores a single fact eav tables are often described as long and skinny long refers to the number of rows skinny to the few columns data is recorded as three columns consider how one would try to represent a general purpose clinical record in a relational database clearly creating a table or a set of tables with thousands of columns is not feasible because the vast majority of columns would be null to complicate things in a longitudinal medical record that follows the patient over time there may be multiple values of the same parameter the height and weight of a child for example change as the child grows finally the universe of clinical findings keeps growing for example diseases emerge and new lab tests are devised this would require constant

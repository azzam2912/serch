it has trucks with traction motors but unlike a b unit it cannot generate power on its own since it lacks a prime mover instead the slug is connected to a powered locomotive called the mother which provides the needed electrical power to operate the traction motors and the motor controls a slug is used to increase adhesive weight allowing full power to be applied at a lower speed thus allowing a higher maximum tractive effort they are often used in low speed operations such as switching operations in yards at low speeds a diesel electric locomotive prime mover is capable of producing more electricity than its traction motors can use effectively extra power would cause the wheels to slip and possibly overheat the traction motors a slug increases the number of traction motors available to the locomotive increasing both the pulling and braking power in addition the load on each traction motor is reduced which helps prevent overheating from excess current slugs typically carry ballast to increase their weight and improve traction large blocks of concrete are frequently used for this purpose substituting for the weight of the now absent prime mover slugs can be built new or converted

in this process steel is heated above the upper critical point above the transformation range and then quenched in a salt oil or lead bath kept at a temperature of 150 300 c the workpiece is held at this temperature above martensite start ms point until the temperature becomes uniform throughout the cross section of workpiece after that it is cooled in air or oil to room temperature the steel is then tempered in this process austenite is transformed to martensite by step quenching at a rate fast enough to avoid the formation of ferrite pearlite or bainite in the martempering process austenitized metal part is immersed in a bath at a temperature just above the martensite start temperature ms by using interrupted quenching the cooling is stopped at a point above the martensite transformation region to ensure sufficient time for the center to cool to the same temperature as the surface the metal part is then removed from the bath and cooled in air to room temperature to permit the austenite to transform to martensite martempering is a method by which the stresses and strains generated during the quenching of a steel component can be controlled in martempering steel

i believe in everything was released as a single in 1971 the b side was my size the song also appears on entwistle s debut solo album smash your head against the wall when entwistle was asked about the song in comparison to the rest of the album he said i ve been saying a lot of stuff that i didn t really believe in i sort of wrote it for the heads really the people thinking ah so that s where entwistle s brain s at he really sort of believes in the devil and hell and all that sort of business so i wrote a number that touches on reincarnation then goes into the absurd with father christmas and the whole bit and right at the end just to prevent the heads from thinking that i did believe in everything like i was saying cause they always seem to believe that you actually believe in your own words i believe in some of them but not all of them so i just wrote the joke in to throw them off and it s done it the song ends with a chorus of rudolph the red nosed reindeer

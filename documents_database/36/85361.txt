large faults within the earth s crust result from the action of plate tectonic forces with the largest forming the boundaries between the plates such as subduction zones or transform faults energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of most earthquakes a fault plane is the plane that represents the fracture surface of a fault a fault trace or fault line is a place where the fault can be seen or mapped on the surface a fault trace is also the line commonly plotted on geologic maps to represent a fault since faults do not usually consist of a single clean fracture geologists use the term fault zone when referring to the zone of complex deformation associated with the fault plane because of friction and the rigidity of the constituent rocks the two sides of a fault cannot always glide or flow past each other easily and so occasionally all movement stops the regions of higher friction along a fault plane where it becomes locked are called asperities when a fault is locked stress builds up and when it reaches a level that exceeds the strength threshold the fault ruptures and the accumulated strain energy

it is most often referenced by its alias ny eso 1 cancer testis antigen 1b is a protein belonging to the family of cancer testis antigens cta that are expressed in a variety of malignant tumours at the mrna and protein levels but also restricted to testicular germ cells in normal adult tissues a clone of ctag gene was originally identified by immunological methods in oesophageal carcinoma using patient serum the aberrant re expression of ctas is induced by molecular mechanisms including dna demethylation histone post translational modification and microrna mediated regulation the effect of dna demethylation is evident by the capability of demethylating agents like 5 aza 2 deoxycytidine to induce ctas re expression in tumour cells but not in normal epithelial cells ctag1b is located on the long arm of chromosome x xq28 containing three exons that are approximately 8 kb in length ctag1b is found to have a neighbouring gene of identical sequence ctag1a the gene encodes a 180 amino acid polypeptide expressed from 18 weeks during embryonic development until birth in human fetal testis it is also strongly expressed in spermatogonia and in primary spermatocytes of adult testis but not in post meiotic cells or testicular

the idea influenced the development of quantum key distribution protocols used in quantum cryptography the idea was put forward in about 1970 by stephen wiesner a graduate student at columbia university though it was rejected by a number of scientific journals meaning that it remained unpublished until 1983 in addition to a unique serial number on each bank note these notes are actually more like cheques since a verification step with the bank is required for each transaction there is a series of isolated two state quantum systems for example photons in one of four polarizations could be used at 0 45 90 and 135 to some axis which is referred to as the vertical each of these is a two state system in one of two bases the horizontal basis has states with polarizations at 0 and 90 to the vertical and the diagonal basis has states at 45 and 135 to the vertical at the bank there is a record of all the polarizations and the corresponding serial numbers on the bank note the serial number is printed but the polarizations are kept secret thus whilst the bank can always verify the polarizations by measuring the polarization of

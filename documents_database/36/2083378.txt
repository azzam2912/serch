a special case of the sitnikov problem was first discovered by the american scientist william duncan macmillan in 1911 but the problem as it currently stands wasn t discovered until 1961 by sitnikov the system consists of two primary bodies with the same mass formula 1 which move in circular or elliptical kepler orbits around their center of mass the third body which is substantially smaller than the primary bodies and whose mass can be set to zero formula 2 moves under the influence of the primary bodies in a plane that is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the primary bodies see figure 1 the origin of the system is at the focus of the primary bodies a combined mass of the primary bodies formula 3 an orbital period of the bodies formula 4 and a radius of the orbit of the bodies formula 5 are used for this system in addition the gravitational constant is 1 in such a system that the third body only moves in one dimension it moves only along the z axis in order to derive the equation of motion in the case of circular orbits for the primary bodies use that the total

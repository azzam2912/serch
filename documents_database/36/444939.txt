the program was a joint effort between nasa s langley research center dryden flight research center at edwards air force base california and northrop grumman the program became at that time 2003 according to supersonic transport the most extensive study on the sonic boom after measuring the 1 300 recordings some taken inside the shock wave by a chase plane the ssbd demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one third several of the flights included nasa dryden s f 15b research testbed aircraft following to measure the f 5e s shock wave signature close up during the flights many shock wave patterns were measured by the f 15b at various distances and orientations from the f 5e an unmodified f 5e flew a few seconds behind the demonstration aircraft to provide a baseline sonic boom measurement to validate the reduced boom produced by the demonstrator a u s air force test pilot school blanik l 23 glider carrying a microphone on the left wingtip and a pressure transducer on the side of the fuselage flew at a lower altitude of under the path of the f 5e which flew at to record sonic booms in the air in addition

he there completed his phd thesis in 1981 in zoology and then graduated as a forest engineer at eth zurich in 1982 after seven years of research in soil physics he was elected as professor on the newly established eth chair of soil protection 1990 he has authored or co authored more than 200 papers in international peer reviewed journals and is co author of a german textbook on soil ecology rainer schulin is married and has a daughter in a model ecosystem experiment schulin and coworkers showed that soil can play a key role in the growth and evapotranspiration responses of young forest vegetation on elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide up to then soil had been neglected as a factor in the response of vegetation to elevated carbon dioxide in another model ecosystem experiment schulin s team found that moderate topsoil pollution by heavy metals significantly reduced evapotranspiration of a young forest vegetation due to reduced root growth in particular during periods of drought stress and that roots compensated for metal toxicity in the topsoil by increasing water extraction from the subsoil it could also be demonstrated that the biodegradable chelant edds can be used to enhance phytoextraction of polluting

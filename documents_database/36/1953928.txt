in this process cells are tagged with magnetic nanoparticles nanoshuttle that are used to render them magnetic once magnetic these cells can be rapidly printed into specific 3d patterns using external magnetic forces that mimic tissue structure and function there are several advantages to using magnetic 3d bioprinting over other 3d printing modalities such as extrusion photolithography and stereolithography this includes the rapid bioprinting process 15 min 1 h compared to the days long processes of others the endogenous synthesis of extracellular matrix ecm without the need of an artificial protein substrate and fine spatial control using this system 3d cell culture models can be rapidly printed from simple spheroids and rings to more complex organotypic models like of the lung aortic valve and fat the first commercially available 3d bioprinting system is being commercialized by nano3d biosciences inc the first application of this system is for high throughput and high content drug screening the cells first need to be incubated in the presence of magnetic nanoparticles to make them more susceptible to manipulation through magnetic fields the system developed by nano3d biosciences uses a nanoshuttle which is a nanoparticle assembly consisting of gold magnetic iron oxide and poly l

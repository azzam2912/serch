it was first isolated from meteorite fragments buried in the sands of a desert near tataouine tunisia the bacterium may exist as two forms cyst and rod its morphology depends on the environment during daytime when the desert environment is extremely hot and dry ramlibacter tataouinensis exist in cyst form in its cyst form ramlibacter tataouinensis is well protected against desiccation remarkably this novel desert bacterium has the highest known average g c content among the beta proteobacterium g c base pairs are known to have stronger hydrogen bonding interactions than a t base pairing thus a higher g c content may prove to be a protective mechanism for life in harsh desert conditions the genome of ramlibacter tataouinensis encodes for numerous light receptors the number of light receptors found in ramlibacter tataouinensis a chemolithotroph is usually seen in phototrophic bacteria a total of six genes encodes for light sensing proteins 2 red infrared sensing and 4 blue light sensing these light sensing proteins would allow ramlibacter tataouinensis to distinguish between night and day a discrete ability to tell time may facilitate the growth pattern of the desert bacterium during cold desert nights dew forms and the availability of water

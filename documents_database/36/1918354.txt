sun wei of mechanical engineering school of inner mongolia university of science and technology imust the main purpose of this experimental uav is to explore feasibility of the application of modular design to aircraft imust modular multifunction uav has a conventional layout with tricycle landing gear system and power is provided by a two blade propeller installed in the nose of the aircraft the empennage is different from ordinary aircraft in that the rudder and tailplanes are in crucifix form however the great difference that distinguishes the uav from all other aircraft is that the fuselage of the uav consists of several interchangeable modules each with its own functions these modules enable the payloads to be rapidly exchanged instead of spending several months back in the factory to refit when mission requirement changes the other benefit is since each module has its own payload performing a specific function and every module has its own built in test diagnose system once the fault is identified the module containing faulty parts can be rapidly replaced specification list of unmanned aerial vehicles of the people s republic of china

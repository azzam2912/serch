it functions in analgesia it is located in the rostral intermediate and caudal regions of the hypothalamus the rostral region aids in the production of both somatostatin and thyroid releasing hormone the intermediate portion aids in production of thyroid releasing hormone somatostatin leptin gastrin and neuropeptide y in humans and primates it also produces gnrh lastly the caudal region aids in sympathetic nervous system regulation and is regarded as the rage center the periventricular nucleus does not have an effective blood brain barrier this nucleus has been shown to affect the release of gnrh gonadotropin releasing hormone in several ways one way is its expression of neuropeptide y which has an impact on the hypothalamic pathway responsible for gnrh secretion the periventricular nucleus has also been shown to have many neurons that express kisspeptin which generates a surge in lh which ultimately leads to the release of gnrh in female rats there is a greater expression of estrogen receptor beta in the periventricular nuclear cells which is thought to lead to different levels of lh secretion in males and females this region has been shown to aid in the production of somatostatin and research shows that neurons releasing somatostatin are

it recognized 16 spoken words and the digits 0 through 9 it was developed by william c dersch in the advanced systems development division laboratory at ibm it was displayed at the ibm pavilion during the 1962 seattle world s fair it was approximately the size and shape of a standard american shoebox it had a display of ten small lamp lights labeled with the digits 0 through 9 and an attached microphone speaking the name of the digit into the microphone would cause the appropriate digit lamp to light inside the box was a power supply three analog audio filters and some presumably diode resistor logic circuitry the design allowed for the recognition of each digit name zero one two nine and its front middle and ending sound sometimes no middle and that each sound was high pitched middle pitched or low pitched example five is high middle high zero is high middle low the microphone was connected to the three audio filters for high middle and low pass the filters latched the logic based decoder and switched one of the ten lamps early development in natural language processing like the ibm shoebox has influenced development in fields such

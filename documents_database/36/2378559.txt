these periodic sequences are generated by internal duplications in both coding and non coding genomic sequences repetitive units of protein tandem repeats are considerably diverse ranging from the repetition of a single amino acid to domains of 100 or more residues tandem repeats are ubiquitous in proteomes and occur in at least 14 of all proteins for example they are present in almost every third human protein and even in every second protein from plasmodium falciparum or dictyostelium discoideum tandem repeats with short repetitive units especially homorepeats are more frequent than others approximately half of the tandem repeat regions has intrinsically disordered conformation being naturally unfolded the other half of the regions with the stable 3d structure has a plethora of shapes and functions depending on the length of the repetitive units their protein structures can be subdivided into five classes some well known examples of proteins with tandem repeats are collagen which plays a key role in the arrangement of the extracellular matrix alpha helical coiled coils having structural and oligomerization functions leucine rich repeat proteins which specifically bind a number of globular proteins by their concave surfaces and zinc finger proteins which regulate the expression of genes by

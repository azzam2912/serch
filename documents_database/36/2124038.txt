the method uses a frequency comb laser combined with a high finesse optical cavity to produce an absorption spectrum in a highly parallel manner the method is also capable of detecting trace gases in very low concentration due to the enhancement effect of the optical resonator on the effective optical path length understanding of the principle of operation of vernier spectroscopy requires an understanding of frequency comb lasers the oscillating electric field of a laser or any time dependent signal can be represented by a sum of sinusoidal signals in the frequency domain using the fourier series the oscillating electric field of a coherent continuous wave cw laser is represented as a single narrow peak in the frequency domain representation if the laser is amplitude modulated to produce a stable train of very short pulses usually through mode locking the equivalent frequency domain representation is a series of narrow frequency peaks centered around the laser s original cw frequency these frequency peaks are separated by the frequency of the time domain pulses this is called the repetition rate of the frequency comb since the sensitivity of absorption spectroscopy depends on the path length of the light in the test sample

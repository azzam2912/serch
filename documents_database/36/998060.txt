a sailmaker typically works on shore in a sail loft the sail loft has other sailmakers large ocean going sailing ships often had sailmakers in the crew the sailmaker maintained and repaired sails this required knowledge of the sailmaker s craft and the tools of the sailmakers loft on shore today one of a sailmaker s important jobs is to teach people how to set and trim their sails to get the most out of them sometimes a sailmaker will accompany the client out on the water and adjust the sails the modern sailmaker uses computer aided design and manufacturing tools computer graphics allow the sailmaker to produce a lines drawing of the sail once the design is complete the sailmaker can now use a low power laser to cut the material to the exact shape sailmakers have recently started using computational fluid dynamics cfd the study of the flow of fluids over or through physical objects in order to create more efficient sail or foil shapes in the design process after cfd analysis is run complex data sets can be rendered graphically to enhance understanding of the design s likely results before sails are ever cut

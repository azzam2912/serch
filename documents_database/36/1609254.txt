john s newfoundland and labrador this basin formed in response to the large scale plate tectonic forces that ripped apart the super continent pangea and also led to sea floor spreading in the north atlantic ocean this basin is one of a series of rift basins that are located on the broad shallow promontory of continental crust known as the grand banks of newfoundland off canada s east coast the basin was named after a purported 20 metres 11 fathom shoal labelled as ste jeanne d arc on out dated bathymetric charts and which was once thought to represent a local exposure of basement rocks similar to the virgin rocks the upper crust beneath the wide shoals of the grand banks region is composed of old precambrian and paleozoic strata that were moderately deformed by compression during the collisions of ancient continental plates during final assembly of the super continent pangea in devonian to carboniferous times later these old basement rocks were subjected to multiple episodes of stretching during the mesozoic and the strain of that extension was expressed in growth of large rips in the rock fabric known as faults the crust was thinned in areas of stretching and

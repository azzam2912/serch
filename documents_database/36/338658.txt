in order to avoid errors during coordinate transmissions the coordinates of this point are 600 000 m e 200 000 m n the 0 0 coordinate is located near bordeaux france though e coordinate is denoted as y and n coordinate x e coordinate is the first axis of this cartesian system namely a point is denoted as y x as an example the observatory is 600 000 200 000 this definition invokes the following effects the ch1903 datum is a refinement and improvement of ch1903 it is based on wgs84 and it was devised for the national land survey of 1995 lv 95 for landesvermessung 1995 the coordinates of its new reference point the zimmerwald observatory should maintain the ch1903 coordinates as far as possible the maximum shift between the two datums is 3 metres on the ground so most map and gps users will not notice any difference the easting and northing is increased by 2 and 1 million respectively resulting in 14 digit rather than 12 digit metre coordinates

the term geochemical tells us that geological and chemical factors are all included the migration of heated and compressed chemical elements and compounds such as silicon aluminium and general alkali metals through the means of subduction and volcanism is known in the geological world as geochemical cycles the geochemical cycle encompasses the natural separation and concentration of elements and heat assisted recombination processes changes may not be apparent over a short term such as with biogeochemical cycles but over a long term changes of great magnitude occur including the evolution of continents and oceans some may use the terms biogeochemical cycle and geochemical cycle interchangeably because both cycles deal with earth s reservoirs however a biogeochemical cycle refers to the chemical interactions in surface reservoirs such as the atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere whereas a geochemical cycle refers to the chemical interactions that exist in crustal and sub crustal reservoirs such as the deep earth and lithosphere the earth as a system is open to radiation from the sun and space but is practically closed with regard to matter as all closed systems it follows the law of conservation of mass which states that matter cannot be created nor destroyed

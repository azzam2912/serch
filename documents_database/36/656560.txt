it was invented by lesley gracey a yorkshire native who was hired by william grant sons to work in new liquid development for some of their products a decade later she was tasked with creating a new super premium gin in addition to the traditional juniper infusion hendrick s uses bulgarian rose and cucumber to add flavour hendrick s gin is bottled in a dark brown apothecary style bottle hendrick s uses a blend of spirits produced from a carter head still constructed in 1948 of which there are only a few in the world and a small pot still built in 1860 by bennett sons shears both have been restored to working order after being bought at auction in the 1960s by the former william grant life president charles gordon the two stills produce strikingly different styles of gin due to their different construction and methods of distillation the pot still is generally referred to as the bennett still the still is quite small which allows most of the botanical flavour characteristics to pass into the spirit the still is filled with neutral spirit and the botanical recipe added with some water this is left to steep for 24

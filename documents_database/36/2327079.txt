the specific epithet lit roughened is due to the bumpy texture of the blades leaf like structures this texture also leads to the common name which evokes the luxurious feel of a towel from a turkish bath the rough papillae strewn blade surface even makes it difficult to measure the temperature using infrared thermometers it is a perennial species like many species in gigartinaceae the appearance of c exasperatus can vary depending upon grown conditions it can be confused with chondracanthus spinosus and gigartina binghamiae and it might take rflp analysis to be sure of the species in addition the names of the species in the genera gigartina and chondracanthus have been adjusted several times since 1961 the leaf margins of the blades are smooth in cooler water and then become toothed and jagged as the temperature increases increased water velocity will cause the blades to change shape the color of the thallus is greenish when exposed to ultraviolet light but when it grows in deeper water it is darker red to purple though it prefers lower water temperatures it can grow at 25 c but ends up dark red to black in color and having flat or cylindrical branch

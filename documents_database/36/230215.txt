they include members of the families elateridae lampyridae phengodidae and rhagophthalmidae among beetles as well as members of the genera arachnocampa keroplatus and orfelia among keroplatid fungus gnats four families of beetles are bioluminescent the wingless larviform females and larvae of these bioluminescent species are usually known as glowworms winged males may or may not also exhibit bioluminescence their light may be emitted as flashes or as a constant glow and usually range in color from green yellow to orange the families are closely related and are all members of the beetle superfamily elateroidea phylogenetic analyses have indicated that bioluminescence may have a single evolutionary origin among the families lampyridae phengodidae and rhagophthalmidae but is likely to have arisen independently among elateridae three genera of fungus gnats are bioluminescent and known as glowworms in their larval stage they produce a blue green light the larvae spin sticky webs to catch food they are found in caves overhangs rock cavities and other sheltered wet areas they are usually classified under the family keroplatidae but this is not universally accepted and some authors place them under mycetophilidae instead despite the similarities in function and appearance the bioluminescent systems of the three genera

unlike reversals however an excursion does not permanently change the large scale orientation of the field but rather represents a dramatic typically short lived change in field intensity with a variation in pole orientation of up to 45 from the previous position these events which typically last a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years often involve declines in field strength to between 0 and 20 of normal excursions unlike reversals are generally not recorded around the entire globe this is partially due to them not being recorded well within the sedimentary record but also because they likely do not extend through the entire geomagnetic field one of the first excursions to be studied was the laschamp event dated at around years ago this event was a complete reversal of polarity however as it later turned out though with the reversed field 5 of the normal strength since this event has also been seen in sites around the globe it is suggested as one of the few examples of a truly global excursion scientific opinion is divided on what causes geomagnetic excursions the dominant theory is that they are an inherent aspect of the dynamo processes that

the key elements of an amino acid are carbon c hydrogen h oxygen o and nitrogen n although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids about 500 naturally occurring amino acids are known though only 20 appear in the genetic code and can be classified in many ways they can be classified according to the core structural functional groups locations as alpha beta gamma or delta amino acids other categories relate to polarity ph level and side chain group type aliphatic acyclic aromatic containing hydroxyl or sulfur etc in the form of proteins amino acid residues form the second largest component water is the largest of human muscles and other tissues beyond their role as residues in proteins amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis in biochemistry amino acids having both the amine and the carboxylic acid groups attached to the first alpha carbon atom have particular importance they are known as 2 alpha or amino acids generic formula hnchrcooh in most cases where r is an organic substituent known as a side chain often the term amino acid is used to refer specifically to these they include

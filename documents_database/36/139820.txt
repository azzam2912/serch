this article will be concerned solely with the three dimensional case there are two approaches to defining the plane at infinity which depend on whether one starts with a projective 3 space or an affine 3 space if a projective 3 space is given the plane at infinity is any distinguished projective plane of the space this point of view emphasizes the fact that this plane is not geometrically different than any other plane on the other hand given an affine 3 space the plane at infinity is a projective plane which is added to the affine 3 space in order to give it closure of incidence properties meaning that the points of the plane at infinity are the points where parallel lines of the affine 3 space will meet and the lines are the lines where parallel planes of the affine 3 space will meet the result of the addition is the projective 3 space formula 1 this point of view emphasizes the internal structure of the plane at infinity but does make it look special in comparison to the other planes of the space if the affine 3 space is real formula 2 then the addition of a

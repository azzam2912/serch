it is a strongly regular graph with parameters srg 27 16 10 8 the intersection graph of the 27 lines on a cubic surface is a locally linear graph that is the complement of the schl fli graph that is two vertices are adjacent in the schl fli graph if and only if the corresponding pair of lines are skew the schl fli graph may also be constructed from the system of eight dimensional vectors and the 24 other vectors obtained by permuting the first six coordinates of these three vectors these 27 vectors correspond to the vertices of the schl fli graph two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding two vectors have 1 as their inner product alternately this graph can be seen as the complement of the collinearity graph of the generalized quadrangle gq 2 4 the neighborhood of any vertex in the schl fli graph forms a 16 vertex subgraph in which each vertex has 10 neighbors the numbers 16 and 10 coming from the parameters of the schl fli graph as a strongly regular graph these subgraphs are all isomorphic to the complement graph of the clebsch graph since the clebsch graph is

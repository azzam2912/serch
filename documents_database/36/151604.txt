the event involves a pair of performers acting out a literary piece or program under certain restraints including not making eye contact with and touching your partner and no props pieces used often include published books movies short stories plays or poems participants may cut anything out of their piece but cannot add any dialogue this event can either be dramatic or humorous like other interpretation events props and costumes are not allowed and the performers rely on things such as pantomime to convey what is happening duo interpretation differs from the other events in the sense that the most important element is how well the duo partners work with each other partners are not allowed to look at each other or touch each other so they must come up with other means to convey two characters talking to each other physically interacting with each other etc like in other interpretation events the competitors will often pick a point on the wall in front of them to look at pretending it is their subject stance is key in duo interpretation where even the slightest shift could indicate a change timing is also crucial when it comes to conveying physical interactions

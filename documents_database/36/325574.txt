it uses the luminosity of the brightest red giant branch stars in a galaxy as a standard candle to gauge the distance to that galaxy it has been used in conjunction with observations from the hubble space telescope to determine the relative motions of the local cluster of galaxies within the local supercluster ground based 8 meter class telescopes like the vlt are also able to measure the trgb distance within reasonable observation times in the local universe the hertzsprung russell diagram hr diagram is a plot of stellar luminosity versus surface temperature for a population of stars during the core hydrogen burning phase of a sun like star s lifetime it will appear on the hr diagram at a position along a diagonal band called the main sequence when the hydrogen at the core is exhausted energy will continue to be generated by hydrogen fusion in a shell around the core the center of the star will accumulate the helium ash from this fusion and the star will migrate along an evolutionary branch of the hr diagram that leads toward the upper right that is the surface temperature will decrease and the total energy output luminosity of the star

the phd finger motif resembles the metal binding ring domain cys his cys and fyve domain it occurs as a single finger but often in clusters of two or three and it also occurs together with other domains such as the chromodomain and the bromodomain the phd finger approximately 50 80 amino acids in length is found in more than 100 human proteins several of the proteins it occurs in are found in the nucleus and are involved in chromatin mediated gene regulation the phd finger occurs in proteins such as the transcriptional co activators p300 and cbp polycomb like protein pcl trithorax group proteins like ash1l ash2l and mll the autoimmune regulator aire mi 2 complex part of histone deacetylase complex the co repressor tif1 the jarid1 family of demethylases and many more the nmr structure of the phd finger from human wstf williams syndrome transcription factor shows that the conserved cysteines and histidine coordinate two zn ions in general the phd finger adopts a globular fold consisting of a two stranded beta sheet and an alpha helix the region consisting of these secondary structures and the residues involved in coordinating the zinc ions are very conserved among species

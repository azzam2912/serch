abstract algebra is primarily the study of specific algebraic structures and their properties algebraic structures may be viewed in different ways however the common starting point of algebra texts is that an algebraic object incorporates one or more sets with one or more binary operations or unary operations satisfying a collection of axioms another branch of mathematics known as universal algebra studies algebraic structures in general from the universal algebra viewpoint most structures can be divided into varieties and quasivarieties depending on the axioms used some axiomatic formal systems that are neither varieties nor quasivarieties called nonvarieties are sometimes included among the algebraic structures by tradition concrete examples of each structure will be found in the articles listed algebraic structures are so numerous today that this article will inevitably be incomplete in addition to this there are sometimes multiple names for the same structure and sometimes one name will be defined by disagreeing axioms by different authors most structures appearing on this page will be common ones which most authors agree on other web lists of algebraic structures organized more or less alphabetically include jipsen and planetmath these lists mention many structures not included below and may present more information

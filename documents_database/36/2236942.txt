senile plaques are extracellular aggregations of amyloid b a protein neurofibrillary tangles are collections of hyperphosphorylated tau protein associated with microtubules found within neurons senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are widespread throughout brain tissue and mirror other pathological changes associated with ad neurons typically remain in g0 a nondividing nonreplicating phase of the cell cycle neurons subject to loss of synaptic connections chronic exposure to oxidative stress or stress hormones like glucocorticoids will exit g0 and reenter into a cell cycle that is abortive and leads to cell death through apoptosis the g0 to g1 transition in neurons is normally only observed for stressed neurons about to undergo apoptosis upon entering g1 these stressed neurons will be arrested at the g1 checkpoint by the absence of cyclin e1 and or the inhibition of the cyclin e1 cdk2 complex by p21 p27 and p53 next the absence of cyclin a1 commits the neuron to division but the cell lacks the ability to re differentiate since the cell is unable to complete the cell cycle it dies via apoptosis meikrantz et al 1995 in the past decade research has shown that neuronal cell cycle reentry plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis

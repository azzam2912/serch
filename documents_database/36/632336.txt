although this sp center disrupts the continuous overlap of p orbitals traditionally thought to be a requirement for aromaticity considerable thermodynamic stability and many of the spectroscopic magnetic and chemical properties associated with aromatic compounds are still observed for such compounds this formal discontinuity is apparently bridged by p orbital overlap maintaining a contiguous cycle of electrons that is responsible for this preserved chemical stability the concept of homoaromaticity was pioneered by saul winstein in 1959 prompted by his studies of the tris homocyclopropenyl cation since the publication of winstein s paper much research has been devoted to understanding and classifying these molecules which represent an additional class of aromatic molecules included under the continuously broadening definition of aromaticity to date homoaromatic compounds are known to exist as cationic and anionic species and some studies support the existence of neutral homoaromatic molecules though these are less common the homotropylium cation ch is perhaps the best studied example of a homoaromatic compound the term homoaromaticity derives from the structural similarity between homoaromatic compounds and the analogous homo conjugated alkenes previously observed in the literature the iupac gold book requires that bis tris etc prefixes be used to describe homoaromatic compounds in

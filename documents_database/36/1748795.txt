the four axle eurolight was designed to have a low axle load for use on cross border operations on non electrified european secondary routes enabling operators to bypass bottlenecks on main corridors the locomotive used components from the 20 22 t axleload vossloh euro locomotive series but with a c175 engine from caterpillar inc 12 or 16 cylinder of 2 3 or 2 8 mw and traction electronics from abb group the cat engines meet european stage iiia emission standards and can be modified to meet 2012 iiib emission standards by replacing the exhaust silencer with a diesel particulate filter mass reduction was achieved by switching to a lighter engine alternator set as well as using lighter weight auxiliary system components the bogie is the design used in the renfe class 334 locomotive with coil spring primary and secondary suspension the abb traction system uses a 6 pole brushless wgx560 synchronous alternator directly coupled to the cat engine the alternator supplies two traction packages abb bordline cc1500 de compact converters each with rectifier to create an intermediate dc supply braking chopper and drive electronics ac800 pec with adhesion anti slip control controlling two traction inverters and one auxiliary inverter per

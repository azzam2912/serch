it is the most significant long lived fission product of uranium fission producing the largest fraction of the total long lived radiation emissions of nuclear waste technetium 99 has a fission product yield of 6 0507 for thermal neutron fission of uranium 235 technetium 99m tc is a short lived half life about 6 hours metastable nuclear isomer used in nuclear medicine produced from molybdenum 99 it decays by isomeric transition to technetium 99 a desirable characteristic since the very long half life and type of decay of technetium 99 imposes little further radiation burden on the body the weak beta emission is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware soft x rays are emitted when the beta particles are stopped but as long as the body is kept more than 30 cm away these should pose no problem the primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust such radioactive contamination in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk due to its high fission yield relatively long half life and mobility in the environment technetium 99 is one of the more significant components of nuclear waste measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel it is the

for example a zinc finger containing arginine at position 1 and aspartic acid at position 2 along its alpha helix will recognise an extended sequence of four nucleotides of the sequence 5 nng g t 3 the hydrogen bond between asp and the n4 of either a cytosine or adenine base paired to the guanine or thymine respectively defines these two nucleotides at the 3 position defining a sequence that overlaps into the subsite of any zinc finger that may be attached n terminally target site overlap limits the modularity of those zinc fingers which exhibit it by restricting the number of situations to which they can be applied if some of the zinc fingers are restricted in this way then a larger repertoire is required to address the situations in which those zinc fingers cannot be used target site overlap may also affect the selection of zinc fingers during by display in cases where amino acids on a non randomised finger and the bases of its associated subsite influence the binding of residues on the adjacent finger which contains the randomised residues indeed attempts to derive zinc finger proteins targeting the 5 a t nn 3 family of sequences

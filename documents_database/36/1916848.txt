it is called paracompact because it has infinite cells and vertex figures with all vertices as ideal points at infinity it has schl fli symbol 3 6 3 being composed of triangular tiling cells each edge of the honeycomb is surrounded by three cells and each vertex is ideal with infinitely many cells meeting there its vertex figure is a hexagonal tiling it has two lower reflective symmetry constructions as an alternated order 6 hexagonal tiling honeycomb and as from which alternates 3 types colors of triangular tilings around every edge in coxeter notation the removal of the 3rd and 4th mirrors 3 6 3 creates a new coxeter group 3 subgroup index 6 the fundamental domain is 6 times larger by coxeter diagram there are 3 copies of the first original mirror in the new fundamental domain it is similar to the 2d hyperbolic infinite order apeirogonal tiling with infinite apeirogonal faces and all vertices are on the ideal surface it is one of 15 regular hyperbolic honeycombs in 3 space 11 of which like this one are paracompact with infinite cells or vertex figures there are nine uniform honeycombs in the 3 6 3 coxeter group family including

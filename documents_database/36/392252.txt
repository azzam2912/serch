coulomb the equation was first suggested for description of plasma by anatoly vlasov in 1938 and later discussed by him in detail in a monograph first vlasov argues that the standard kinetic approach based on the boltzmann equation has difficulties when applied to a description of the plasma with long range coulomb interaction he mentions the following problems arising when applying the kinetic theory based on pair collisions to plasma dynamics vlasov suggests that these difficulties originate from the long range character of coulomb interaction he starts with the collisionless boltzmann equation sometimes called the vlasov equation anachronistically in this context in generalized coordinates explicitly a pde and adapted it to the case of a plasma leading to the systems of equations shown below here is a general distribution function of particles with momentum at coordinates and given time instead of collision based kinetic description for interaction of charged particles in plasma vlasov utilizes a self consistent collective field created by the charged plasma particles such a description uses distribution functions formula 3 and formula 4 for electrons and positive plasma ions the distribution function formula 5 for species describes the number of particles of the species having approximately the

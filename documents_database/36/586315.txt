more precisely for any complete theory t in a language we write i t for the number of models of t up to isomorphism of cardinality the spectrum problem is to describe the possible behaviors of i t as a function of it has been almost completely solved for the case of a countable theory t in this section t is a countable complete theory and is a cardinal the l wenheim skolem theorem shows that if i t is nonzero for one infinite cardinal then it is nonzero for all of them morley s categoricity theorem was the first main step in solving the spectrum problem it states that if i t is 1 for some uncountable then it is 1 for all uncountable robert vaught showed that i t cannot be 2 it is easy to find examples where it is any given non negative integer other than 2 morley proved that if i t is infinite then it must be or or 2 it is not known if it can be if the continuum hypothesis is false this is called the vaught conjecture and is the main remaining open problem in 2005 in the theory of the

they also have applications for embedded hypersurfaces of pseudo riemannian manifolds in the classical differential geometry of surfaces the gauss codazzi mainardi equations consist of a pair of related equations the first equation sometimes called the gauss equation named after carl friedrich gauss relates the intrinsic curvature or gauss curvature of the surface to the derivatives of the gauss map via the second fundamental form this equation is the basis for gauss s theorema egregium the second equation sometimes called the codazzi mainardi equation is a structural condition on the second derivatives of the gauss map it was named for gaspare mainardi 1856 and delfino codazzi 1868 1869 who independently derived the result although it was discovered earlier by karl mikhailovich peterson it incorporates the extrinsic curvature or mean curvature of the surface the equations show that the components of the second fundamental form and its derivatives along the surface completely classify the surface up to a euclidean transformation a theorem of ossian bonnet let formula 1 be an n dimensional embedded submanifold of a riemannian manifold p of dimension formula 2 there is a natural inclusion of the tangent bundle of m into that of p by the pushforward

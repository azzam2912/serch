his discovery of the central dna flap structure in the hiv genome and its role in viral entry into the nucleus of the infected cell grounded the optimization of lentiviral vectors and paved the way to more than 20 years of development in gene therapy and vaccines based on this gene delivery technology charneau has published more than 100 research articles and holds 25 patents in the field of hiv and lentiviral vectors pierre charneau studied at the pierre and marie curie university upmc in paris from which he holds a research doctorate in molecular and cellular biology 1995 after a short time in undergraduate research at the curie institute he pursued his phd thesis in luc montagnier s viral oncology lab at the pasteur institute on reverse transcription nuclear import and mitosis independent integration of hiv genome charneau s research led to the discovery and characterization of the central dna flap structure within the hiv genome and its key function in nuclear import of the lentivirus hiv genome in non dividing cells this discovery enabled the development of lentiviral vectors that can infect non dividing cells contrary to other types of retroviral gene transfer vectors which can only target

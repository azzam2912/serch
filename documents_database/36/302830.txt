it closely resembles the selberg zeta function and is used to relate closed paths to the spectrum of the adjacency matrix the ihara zeta function was first defined by yasutaka ihara in the 1960s in the context of discrete subgroups of the two by two p adic special linear group jean pierre serre suggested in his book trees that ihara s original definition can be reinterpreted graph theoretically it was toshikazu sunada who put this suggestion into practice in 1985 as observed by sunada a regular graph is a ramanujan graph if and only if its ihara zeta function satisfies an analogue of the riemann hypothesis the ihara zeta functions product is taken over all prime closed geodesics formula 1 of the graph formula 2 where a closed geodesic formula 1 on formula 4 is a finite sequence of vertices formula 5 such that the integer formula 8 is the length formula 9 of formula 1 the closed geodesic formula 1 is prime if it cannot be obtained by repeating a closed geodesic formula 12 times for an integer formula 13 this formulation in graph theoretic setting is due to sunada ihara and sunada in the graph theoretic setting showed

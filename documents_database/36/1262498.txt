more generally cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality data integrity authentication and non repudiation are central to modern cryptography modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics computer science electrical engineering communication science and physics applications of cryptography include electronic commerce chip based payment cards digital currencies computer passwords and military communications cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense the originator of an encrypted message shares the decoding technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries the cryptography literature often uses the names alice a for the sender bob b for the intended recipient and eve eavesdropper for the adversary since the development of rotor cipher machines in world war i and the advent of computers in world war ii the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions making such algorithms

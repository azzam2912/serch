it is localized in the lysosome where it remains associated with the lysosomal membrane glucocerebrosidase is 497 amino acids in length and has a molecular weight of 59 700 daltons glucocerebrosidase is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 30 and consists of three distinct domains i iii domain i residues 1 27 and 383 414 forms a three stranded anti parallel sheet this domain contains two disulfide bridges that are necessary for correct folding as well as a glycosylated residue asn19 that is required for catalytic activity in vivo domain ii residues 30 75 and 431 497 consists of two sheets that resemble an immunoglobulin fold domain iii residues 76 381 and 416 430 is homologous to a tim barrel and is a highly conserved domain among glycoside hydrolases domain iii harbors the active site which binds the substrate glucocerebroside in close proximity to the catalytic residues e340 and e235 domains i and iii are tightly associated while domains ii and iii are joined by a disordered linker crystal structures indicate that glucocerebrosidase binds the glucose moiety and adjacent o glycosydic bond of glucocerebroside the two aliphatic chains of glucocerebroside may remain associated with the lysosomal bilayer or interact

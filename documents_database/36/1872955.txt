these systems were deployed as the primary inner zone anti submarine warfare asw sensor on aircraft carrier based helicopters for over five decades companion versions with the aqs 18 designation were exported to various nations around the globe airborne sonar systems provide a light weight mobile detection sensor for locating and tracking submarines although limited in performance compared to larger ship mounted sonars these helicopter borne systems have the advantage of rapid deployment retrieval times and rapid transition between search areas additional advantages over ship sonars include absence of flow noise and engine noise and the elimination of doppler shift induced by a moving signal source deployed from aircraft carriers or other ships these systems enable the aircraft to locate identify and attack submerged targets within the flight radius from the home ship the aqs 13 systems are all primarily active sonar transmitting in the upper end of the medium frequency sonar range these systems offered the additional capabilities of voice communication bathythermography and rudimentary passive sonar helicopter borne active sonar has significant advantages over other sensors and is especially effective in the inner zone where noise from the ships of the carrier battle group can interfere with passive sensors

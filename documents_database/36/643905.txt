the subtropical separates the more saline subtropical waters from the fresher sub antarctic waters a subtropical frontal zone stfz is a large seasonal cycle located on the eastern side of basins it is made up of fronts of multiple weak sea surface temperature sst aligned northwest southeast spread over a large latitudinal span on the far eastern side of basins the subtropical frontal zone becomes narrower and temperature gradients stronger but still much weaker than across the dynamical subtropical frontal zone a dynamical frontal zone sits at the southern limit of the saline subtropical waters on the western sides of basins there are no water mass boundaries or fronts in correlation with the sea surface temperature at the subtropical frontal zone at the surface or beneath the structure of a subtropical frontal zone results in the formation of a positive wind stress curl which is the shear stress exerted by wind on the surface of water the areas of most positive wind stress curl are characterized by very weak sea surface temperature incline and are likely consistent to regions of mode water the northern subtropical front is found in the pacific ocean between 25 and 30 north latitude the north

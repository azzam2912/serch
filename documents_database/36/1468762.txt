thanks to their different geographic location all around the world the emission variations of the pointed source can be monitored 24 hours a day with the observing task moving from east to west as the earth rotates webt observations are often carried out in conjunction with observations at higher frequencies from ultraviolet to gamma rays performed by both space and ground based telescopes in this way information on blazar emission over almost the whole electromagnetic spectrum can be obtained the multi wavelength studies performed by the webt have the purpose of understanding the physical mechanisms that rule the variable emission of these celestial objects this emission mainly comes from a plasma jet pointing closely to the line of sight and originating from a supermassive black hole located in the core of the host galaxy the webt was founded in autumn 1997 by john mattox from the institute of astrophysical research at the boston university as a collaboration among optical observers three years after in 2000 the leadership was committed to massimo villata from the observatory of turin a constitution was issued defining purposes and management of the organization soon after also radio and near infrared observers joined the consortium until

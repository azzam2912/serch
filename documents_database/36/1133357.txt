tpbg is an antagonist of wnt catenin signalling pathway 5t4 is an antigen expressed in a number of carcinomas it is an n glycosylated transmembrane 72 kda glycoprotein containing eight leucine rich repeats 5t4 is often referred to as an oncofetal antigen due to its expression in foetal trophoblast where it was first discovered or trophoblast glycoprotein tpbg 5t4 is found in tumors including the colorectal ovarian and gastric its expression is used as a prognostic aid in these cases it has very limited expression in normal tissue but is widespread in malignant tumours throughout their development one study found that 5t4 was present in 85 of a cohort of 72 colorectal carcinomas and in 81 of a cohort of 27 gastric carcinomas its confined expression appears to give 5t4 the potential to be a target for t cells in cancer immunotherapy there has been extensive research into its role in antibody directed immunotherapy through the use of the high affinity murine monoclonal antibody mab5t4 to deliver response modifiers such as staphylococcus aureus superantigen accurately to a tumor 5t4 is also the target of the cancer vaccine trovax which is in clinical trials for the treatment of a range of

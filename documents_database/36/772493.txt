their origins go back to the ecclesiastical reorganisation carried out under archbishop theodore of canterbury 668 90 and the establishment of a separate northern province in 733 until 1225 the synods were composed entirely of bishops but during the thirteenth century more and more clergy were cited until by 1283 the membership was established as the bishops deans archdeacons and abbots of each province together with one proctor representative from each cathedral chapter and two proctors elected by the clergy of each diocese the main purpose of the convocations was to take counsel for the well being of the church and to approve canonical legislation but in practice much time was spent in discussing the amount of tax to be paid to the crown since the clergy were a separate estate of the realm and refused to be taxed in or through parliament before the end of the nineteenth century the convocation of canterbury which was numerically very much larger played the major role and the activity of the convocation of york was often little more than giving formal approval to the decisions taken by the southern province in 1534 the convocations were subjected to the control of the crown

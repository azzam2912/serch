the species was also described by akiba in japan in 1958 a second species leucocytozoon schufneri was described by prowazek in 1912 also in the chicken this is now considered to be a synonym this species has been classified into the subgenus akiba because of its vector other species in the genus are transmitted by species of the genus simulium the parasite is transmitted by the bite of its vector on infection of a vertebrate host the parasites enter the blood stream and spread through the body they invade the endothelial cells in a number of organs these grow into multinucleated masses megaloschizonts this first round of schizonts give rise to the first generation of merozoites this first generation of merozoites invade new endothelial cells and give rise to a second generation of schizonts after a number of cell divisions these in turn give rise to the second generation of merozoites which in their turn infect erythrocytes and leukocytes within the erythrocytes or leukocytes the merozoites develop into gametocytes once ingested by a vector male and female gametocytes fuse and give rise to a zygote the zygote invades the body of the vector undergoes a series of cell divisions resulting

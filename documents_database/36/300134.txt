the invention of a practical efficient transformer made ac power distribution feasible a system using distribution transformers was demonstrated as early as 1882 if mounted on a utility pole they are called pole mount transformers if the distribution lines are located at ground level or underground distribution transformers are mounted on concrete pads and locked in steel cases thus known as distribution tap pad mount transformers distribution transformers normally have ratings less than 200 kva although some national standards can allow for units up to 5000 kva to be described as distribution transformers since distribution transformers are energized for 24 hours a day even when they don t carry any load reducing iron losses has an important role in their design as they usually don t operate at full load they are designed to have maximum efficiency at lower loads to have a better efficiency voltage regulation in these transformers should be kept to a minimum hence they are designed to have small leakage reactance distribution transformers are classified into different categories based on factors such as distribution transformers are normally located at a service drop where wires run from a utility pole or underground power lines to a customer

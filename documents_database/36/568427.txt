the accident was caused by fracture of the brake rod when a slowly growing fatigue crack reached a critical size and the brake rod parted following a thorough investigation it was found that metal fatigue failure occurred in the braking mechanism used to slow down the cage as it descended the main part of the set up is the winding motor which is driven by the dc motor two double deck cages are attached to the two ends of the winding rope at the start of the winding cycle power applied to winding motor is gradually increased and mechanical brake released the cages accelerate then maintain a speed of until the cages approach the ends of the shaft during deceleration generator voltage driving the winding motor is reduced to produce regenerative braking and it is finally brought to rest by a mechanical brake mechanical brake consists of a pair of brake shoes applied to the underside of the brake paths by the action of the compressed spring nest operating through a system of levers force is transmitted from the spring nest to main lever through a diameter steel rod long this vertical brake rod is always in tension as the

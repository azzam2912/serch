by observing transitions between as many vibrational energy levels as possible for example through electronic or infrared spectroscopy the difference between the energy levels formula 1 can be calculated this sum will have a maximum at formula 2 representing the point of bond dissociation summing over all the differences up to this point gives the total energy required to dissociate the molecule i e to promote it from the ground state to an unbound state this can be written formula 3 where formula 4 is the dissociation energy if a morse potential is assumed plotting formula 5 against formula 6 should give a straight line from which it is easy to extract formula 2 from the intercept with the x axis in practice such plots often give curves because of unaccounted anharmonicity in the potential furthermore the low population of the higher states or the franck condon principle makes it difficult to experimentally obtain data at high values of formula 8 thus the extrapolation can be inaccurate and only an upper limit for the value of the dissociation energy can be obtained this method takes its name from raymond thayer birge and hertha sponer the two physical chemists that developed

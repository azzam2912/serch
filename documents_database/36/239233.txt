until 2018 rubiviruses were classified as part of the family togaviridae but have since been changed to be the sole genus of the family matonaviridae this new family is named after george de maton who in 1814 first distinguished rubella from measles and scarlet fever the molecular basis for the causation of congenital rubella syndrome are not yet completely clear but in vitro studies with cell lines showed that rubella virus has an apoptotic effect on certain cell types there is evidence for a p53 dependent mechanism group ssrna the spherical virus particles virions of matonaviridae have a diameter of 50 to 70 nm and are covered by a lipid membrane viral envelope derived from the host cell membrane there are prominent spikes projections of 6 nm composed of the viral envelope proteins e1 and e2 embedded in the membrane inside the lipid envelope is a capsid of 40 nm in diameter the e1 glycoprotein is considered immunodominant in the humoral response induced against the structural proteins and contains both neutralizing and hemagglutinating determinants the genome has 9 762 nucleotides and encodes 2 nonstructural polypeptides p150 and p90 within its 5 terminal two thirds and 3 structural polypeptides c e2

collins is a canadian structural engineer whose research is concerned with the design and evaluation of reinforced and prestressed concrete buildings bridges nuclear containment structures and offshore oil platforms collins received his be from the university of canterbury in new zealand in 1964 and his phd from the university of new south wales in australia in 1968 he joined the university of toronto in 1969 was appointed to the bahen tanenbaum chair in civil engineering in 1995 and was selected as a university professor in 1999 he is currently working on his doctorate of science collins has concentrated his research effort on understanding how cracked reinforced concrete resists shear stress shear failures can cause concrete structures to collapse without warning and hence accurate analytical models for shear behaviour are critical for public safety unfortunately most traditional shear design procedures rely upon empirical design rules which lack a rigorous theoretical basis and can be dangerous if applied to new situations the compression field theory and subsequently the modified compression field theory developed by professor collins and his colleagues at the university of toronto faculty of applied science and engineering provides a rational basis for shear design and has received worldwide recognition

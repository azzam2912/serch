such information could be the story of recently received data information on the available computational resources or other run time acquired or a priori known information related to the environment in which it operates among the most used adaptive algorithms is the widrow hoff s least mean squares lms which represents a class of stochastic gradient descent algorithms used in adaptive filtering and machine learning in adaptive filtering the lms is used to mimic a desired filter by finding the filter coefficients that relate to producing the least mean square of the error signal difference between the desired and the actual signal for example stable partition using no additional memory is o n lg n but given o n memory it can be o n in time as implemented by the c standard library codice 1 is adaptive and so it acquires as much memory as it can get up to what it would need at most and applies the algorithm using that available memory another example is adaptive sort whose behavior changes upon the presortedness of its input an example of an adaptive algorithm in radar systems is the constant false alarm rate cfar detector in machine learning and

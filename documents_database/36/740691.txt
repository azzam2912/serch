the swc combines features of the wadcutter target bullet and traditional round nosed revolver bullets and is used in both revolver and pistol cartridges for hunting target shooting and plinking full wadcutters frequently have problems feeding from magazines reliably in automatics so swcs may be used when a true wc is desired but cannot be used for this reason the semiwadcutter design consists of a roughly conical nose truncated with a flat point called a meplat sitting on a cylinder a at right the base of the cone is slightly smaller in diameter than the cylinder leaving a sharp shoulder the flat nose punches a clean hole in the target rather than tearing it like a round nose bullet would and the sharp shoulder enlarges the hole neatly allowing easy and accurate scoring of the target the swc design offers better external ballistics than the wadcutter as its conical nose produces less drag than the flat cylinder a typical modification is to alter the conical section to make the sides concave to reduce the bullet mass or convex to increase it b shows a concave sided swc typical of a lightweight 45 acp bullet used in bullseye shooting the concave

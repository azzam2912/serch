the symbol formula 3 is the inner product on h thus we have that eu n is the space of orthonormal n frames in h the group action of u n on this space is the natural one the base space is then and is the set of grassmannian n dimensional subspaces or n planes in h that is so that v is an n dimensional vector space for n 1 one has eu 1 s which is known to be a contractible space the base space is then bu 1 cp the infinite dimensional complex projective space thus the set of isomorphism classes of circle bundles over a manifold m are in one to one correspondence with the homotopy classes of maps from m to cp one also has the relation that that is bu 1 is the infinite dimensional projective unitary group see that article for additional discussion and properties for a torus t which is abstractly isomorphic to u 1 u 1 but need not have a chosen identification one writes b t the topological k theory k b t is given by numerical polynomials more details below let f c be the space of orthonormal families

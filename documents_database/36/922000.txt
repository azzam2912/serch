in human populations generation time typically ranges from 22 to 33 years historians sometimes use this to date events by converting generations into years to obtain rough estimates of time the existing definitions of generation time fall into two categories those that treat generation time as a renewal time of the population and those that focus on the distance between individuals of one generation and the next below are the three most commonly used definitions the net reproductive rate r is the number of offspring an individual is expected to produce during its lifetime a net reproductive rate of 1 means that the population is at its demographic equilibrium this definition envisions the generation time as a renewal time of the population it justifies the very simple definition used in microbiology the time it takes for the population to double or doubling time since one can consider that during the exponential phase of bacterial growth mortality is very low and as a result a bacterium is expected to be replaced by two bacteria in the next generation the mother cell and the daughter cell if the population dynamic is exponential with a growth rate r i e n t e

it is lighter in color than nimbostratus and darker than high cirrostratus the sun can be seen through thin altostratus but thicker layers can be quite opaque altostratus is formed by the lifting of a large mostly stable air mass that causes invisible water vapor to condense into cloud it can produce light precipitation often in the form of virga if the precipitation increases in persistence and intensity the altostratus cloud may thicken into nimbostratus altostratus most often takes the form of a featureless sheet of cloud but can be wavy undulatus as a result of wind shear through the cloud it can also be fragmented fibratus with clear sky visible which often precedes the approach of a weakened or upper level warm front altostratus can be composed of ice crystals in some ice crystal altostratus very thin rapidly disappearing horizontal sheets of water droplets appear at random the sizes of the ice crystals in the cloud tended to increase as altitude decreased however close to the bottom of the cloud the particles decreased in size again during the sampling of one cloud the scientists noted a halo while flying near the top of the cloud which indicated that the

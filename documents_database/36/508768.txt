then the surface with coordinates x x x is minimal where the x are defined using the real part of a complex integral as follows formula 1 the converse is also true every nonplanar minimal surface defined over a simply connected domain can be given a parametrization of this type for example enneper s surface has z 1 g z z m the weierstrass enneper model defines a minimal surface formula 2 formula 3 on a complex plane formula 4 let formula 5 the complex plane as the formula 6 space we write the jacobian matrix of the surface as a column of complex entries where formula 8 and formula 9 are holomorphic functions of formula 10 the jacobian formula 11 represents the two orthogonal tangent vectors of the surface the surface normal is given by the jacobian formula 11 leads to a number of important properties formula 15 formula 16 formula 17 the proofs can be found in sharma s essay the weierstrass representation always gives a minimal surface the derivatives can be used to construct the first fundamental form matrix and the second fundamental form matrix finally a point formula 20 on the complex plane maps to a

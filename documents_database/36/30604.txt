it is named after the english physicist michael faraday one farad is defined as the capacitance across which when charged with one coulomb there is a potential difference of one volt equally one farad can be described as the capacitance which stores a one coulomb charge across a potential difference of one volt the relationship between capacitance charge and potential difference is linear for example if the potential difference across a capacitor is halved the quantity of charge stored by that capacitor will also be halved for most applications the farad is an impractically large unit of capacitance most electrical and electronic applications are covered by the following si prefixes a farad is represented in terms of si base units as s a m kg it can further be expressed as where hz hertz the term farad was originally coined by latimer clark and charles bright in 1861 in honor of michael faraday for a unit of quantity of charge but by 1873 the farad had become a unit of capacitance in 1881 at the international congress of electricians in paris the name farad was officially used for the unit of electrical capacitance a capacitor generally consists of two conducting

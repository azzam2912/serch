the human sex chromosomes a typical pair of mammal allosomes determine the sex of an individual created in sexual reproduction autosomes differ from allosomes because autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but differ from other pairs in a diploid cell whereas members of an allosome pair may differ from one another and thereby determine sex nettie stevens and edmund beecher wilson both independently discovered sex chromosomes in 1905 however stevens is credited for discovering them earlier than wilson in humans each cell nucleus contains 23 pairs of chromosomes a total of 46 chromosomes the first 22 pairs are called autosomes autosomes are homologous chromosomes i e chromosomes which contain the same genes regions of dna in the same order along their chromosomal arms the chromosomes of the 23rd pair are called allosomes consisting of two x chromosomes in most females and an x chromosome and a y chromosome in most males females therefore have 23 homologous chromosome pairs while males have 22 the x and y chromosomes have small regions of homology called pseudoautosomal regions the x chromosome is always present as the 23rd chromosome in the ovum while either an x or a y chromosome

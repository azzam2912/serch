he was professor emeritus of history and historical theory at staffordshire university he was also visiting professor at the university of chichester his argument is that prior to engaging with the past historians need to acknowledge that the past and history do not share the same ontic and epistemic space he suggests that the past is the time before our perpetual present and history is that range of authored narratives we substitute for it munslow suggests that the consequences of this argument are substantial and not the least among them being the situation that we can only engage with the aesthetics of historying because we cannot access the ontic and epistemic nature of the past the way to avoid that situation is to fuse or as he argues the historian should not con fuse the past with history the past is the before now and the past cannot anticipate the future he accepts that this may seem ironic and happily it is the reason being that history is a singularly unprivileged authorial act undertaken in the perpetual present about the ineffable past he is the author of a number of texts on the philosophy of history including discourse and culture

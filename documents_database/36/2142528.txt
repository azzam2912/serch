the input is a range space formula 1 where formula 2 is a universe of points in formula 3 and formula 4 is a family of subsets of formula 2 called ranges defined by the intersection of formula 2 and geometric shapes such as disks and axis parallel rectangles the goal is to select a minimum size subset formula 7 of ranges such that every point in the universe formula 2 is covered by some range in formula 9 given the same range space formula 10 a closely related problem is the geometric hitting set problem where the goal is to select a minimum size subset formula 11 of points such that every range of formula 4 has nonempty intersection with formula 13 i e is hit by formula 13 in the one dimensional case where formula 2 contains points on the real line and formula 4 is defined by intervals both the geometric set cover and hitting set problems can be solved in polynomial time using a simple greedy algorithm however in higher dimensions they are known to be np complete even for simple shapes i e when formula 4 is induced by unit disks or unit squares the

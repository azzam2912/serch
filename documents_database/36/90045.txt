the pentium m processors had a maximum thermal design power tdp of 5 27 w depending on the model and were intended for use in laptops thus the m suffix standing for mobile they evolved from the core of the last pentium iii branded cpu by adding the front side bus fsb interface of pentium 4 an improved instruction decoding and issuing front end improved branch prediction sse2 support and a much larger cache the first pentium m branded cpu code named banias was followed by dothan the pentium m branded processors were succeeded by the core branded dual core mobile yonah cpu with a modified microarchitecture the pentium m represented a new and radical departure for intel as it was not a low power version of the desktop oriented pentium 4 but instead a heavily modified version of the pentium iii tualatin design itself based on the pentium ii core design which in turn had been a heavily improved evolution of the pentium pro it is optimized for power efficiency a vital characteristic for extending notebook computer battery life running with very low average power consumption and much lower heat output than desktop processors the pentium m runs at

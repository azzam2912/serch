this subfamily of monofunctional glycosylases is involved in the recognition of a variety of base lesions including alkylated and deaminated purines and initiating their repair via the base excision repair pathway to date the human aag haag is the only glycosylase identified that excises alkylation damaged purine bases in human cells dna bases are subject to a large number of anomalies spontaneous alkylation or oxidative deamination it is estimated that 10 mutations appear in a typical human cell per day albeit it seems to be an insignificant amount considering the extension of the dna 10 nucleotides these mutations lead to changes in the structure and coding potential of the dna affecting processes of replication and transcription 3 methyladenine dna glycosilases are able to initiate the base excision repair ber of a wide range of substrate bases that due to their chemical reactivity suffer inevitable modifications resulting in different biological outcomes dna repair mechanisms take on a vital role in maintaining the genomic integrity of cells from different organisms in particular 3 methyladenine dna glycosylases are found in bacteria yeast plants rodents and humans therefore there are different subfamilies of this enzyme such as the human alkyladenine dna glycosylase haag that

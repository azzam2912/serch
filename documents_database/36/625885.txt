originally basic assembly language applied only to an extremely restricted dialect designed to run under control of ibm basic programming support bps 360 on systems with only 8 kb of main memory and only a card reader a card punch and a printer for input output thus the word basic however the full name and the initialism bal almost immediately attached themselves in popular use to all assembly language dialects on the system 360 and its descendants bal for bps 360 was introduced with the system 360 in 1964 assemblers on other system 360 operating systems through system 370 system 390 and system z as well as the univac series 90 mainframes made by sperry corporation and the bs2000 mainframes currently made by fujitsu inherited and extended its syntax the latest derived language is known as the ibm high level assembler hlasm programmers utilizing this family of assemblers also refer to them as alc for assembly language coding or simply assembler bal is also the mnemonic of the branch and link instruction the architecture of ibm mainframes has undergone several extensions over the years including system 360 system 370 system 370 xa esa 370 esa 390 and z architecture each

most fissionable materials need thermal neutrons which move more slowly fast neutron reactors use fast fission to produce energy unlike most nuclear reactors in a conventional reactor a moderator is needed to slow down the neutrons so that they are more likely to fission atoms a fast neutron reactor uses fast neutrons so it does not use a moderator moderators may absorb a lot of neutrons in a thermal reactor and fast fission produces a higher average number of neutrons per fission so fast reactors have better neutron economy making a plutonium breeder reactor possible however a fast neutron reactor must use relatively highly enriched uranium or plutonium so that the neutrons have a better chance of fissioning atoms some atoms notably uranium 238 do not usually undergo fission when struck by slow neutrons but do split when struck with neutrons of high enough energy the fast neutrons produced in a hydrogen bomb by fusion of deuterium and tritium have even higher energy than the fast neutrons produced in a nuclear reactor this makes it possible to increase the yield of any given fusion weapon by the simple expedient of adding layers of cheap natural or even depleted uranium fast

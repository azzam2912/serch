the radiation stresses behave as a second order tensor the radiation stress tensor describes the additional forcing due to the presence of the waves which changes the mean depth integrated horizontal momentum in the fluid layer as a result varying radiation stresses induce changes in the mean surface elevation wave setup and the mean flow wave induced currents for the mean energy density in the oscillatory part of the fluid motion the radiation stress tensor is important for its dynamics in case of an inhomogeneous mean flow field the radiation stress tensor as well as several of its implications on the physics of surface gravity waves and mean flows were formulated in a series of papers by longuet higgins and stewart in 1960 1964 radiation stress derives its name from the analogous effect of radiation pressure for electromagnetic radiation the radiation stress mean excess momentum flux due to the presence of the waves plays an important role in the explanation and modeling of various coastal processes for uni directional wave propagation say in the x coordinate direction the component of the radiation stress tensor of dynamical importance is s it is defined as where p x z t is the

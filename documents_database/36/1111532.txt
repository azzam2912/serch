note these variables are not fully independent e g for a pure material of a fixed grain size at a given pressure temperature and stress the strain rate is given by the flow law associated with the particular mechanism s more than one mechanism may be active under a given set of conditions and some mechanisms cannot operate independently but must act in conjunction with another in order that significant permanent strain can develop in a single deformation episode the dominant mechanism may change with time e g recrystallization to a fine grain size at an early stage may allow diffusive mass transfer processes to become dominant the recognition of the active mechanism s in a material almost always requires the use of microscopic techniques in most cases using a combination of optical microscopy sem and tem using a combination of experimental deformation to find the flow laws under particular conditions and from microscopic examination of the samples afterwards it has been possible to represent the conditions under which individual deformation mechanisms dominate for some materials in the form of deformation mechanism maps five main mechanisms are recognized cataclastic flow dislocation creep recrystallization diffusive mass transfer and grain boundary sliding

the major advantages of the czm over the conventional methods in fracture mechanics like those including lefm linear elastic fracture mechanics ctod crack tip open displacement are another important advantage of czm falls in the conceptual framework for interfaces the cohesive zone model does not represent any physical material but describes the cohesive forces which occur when material elements are being pulled apart as the surfaces known as cohesive surfaces separate traction first increases until a maximum is reached and then subsequently reduces to zero which results in complete separation the variation in traction in relation to displacement is plotted on a curve and is called the traction displacement curve the area under this curve is equal to the energy needed for separation czm maintains continuity conditions mathematically despite physical separation it eliminates singularity of stress and limits it to the cohesive strength of the material the traction displacement curve gives the constitutive behavior of the fracture for each material system guidelines are to be formed and modelling is done individually this is how the czm works the amount of fracture energy dissipated in the work region depends on the shape of the model considered also the ratio between the

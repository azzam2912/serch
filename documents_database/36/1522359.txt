the system was invented and developed by nissan motors and was tested on the nissan patrol in the middle east the system helps reduce body lean while turning for a more comfortable ride utilizing hydraulic cylinders located at the shock absorbers connected via cross piping and two accumulators it adjusts roll stiffness by allowing transfer of fluid between the left and right sides of the vehicle through passive weight transfer during normal driving it also helps reduce bump shock by setting bounce and roll damping forces separately in off road conditions hbmc activates when it senses that a wheel has dropped the hydraulic body motion control system was first available on the new model year 2010 nissan patrol a sport utility vehicle that is sold worldwide and shares a platform with the infiniti qx the system was also introduced in similar form on the 2011 infiniti qx two hydraulic systems connected by cross link hydraulic pipes to the 4 wheel independent suspension s hydraulic cylinders absorb road bumps and help reduce body lean when cornering this helps minimize fluctuation of view of those on board and provides a more comfortable ride unlike other similar systems this does not need a

it allows a qualitative understanding of the corresponding phenomena like time dilation and length contraction without mathematical equations minkowski diagrams are two dimensional graphs that depict events as happening in a universe consisting of one space dimension and one time dimension unlike a regular distance time graph the distance is displayed on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis additionally the time and space units of measurement are chosen in such a way that an object moving at the speed of light is depicted as following a 45 angle to the diagram s axes in this way each object like an observer or a vehicle traces a certain line in the diagram which is called its world line also each point in the diagram represents a certain position in space and time and is called an event regardless of whether anything relevant happens there and then in the study of 1 dimensional kinematics position vs time graphs also called distance vs time graphs or p t graphs provide a useful means to describe motion the specific features of the motion of objects are demonstrated by the shape and the slope of the lines in the accompanying figure the

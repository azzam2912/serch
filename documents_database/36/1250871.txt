the compound was first observed in tokyo japan in 1971 first isolated from the fungus penicillium brefeldianum mizoribine mzb is an imidazole nucleoside that has been used in renal transplantation and in steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome iga nephropathy lupus as well as for adults with rheumatoid arthritis lupus nephritis and other rheumatic diseases mzb exerts its activity through selective inhibition of inosine monophosphate synthetase and guanosine monophosphate synthetase resulting in the complete inhibition of guanine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into nucleotides it arrests dna synthesis in the s phase of cellular division thus mzb has less toxicity than azathioprine another immunosuppressant used for some of the same diseases mizoribine mzb is an imidazole nucleoside that has been used in renal transplantation and in steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome iga nephropathy lupus as well as for adults with rheumatoid arthritis lupus nephritis and other rheumatic diseases mzb exerts its activity through selective inhibition of inosine monophosphate synthetase and guanosine monophosphate synthetase resulting in the complete inhibition of guanine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into nucleotides it arrests dna synthesis in the s phase of cellular division thus mzb has less toxicity than azathioprine another immunosuppressant used for some of the same diseases

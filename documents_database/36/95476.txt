studies in this branch of biology examine such phenomena as adaptation speciation and population structure population genetics was a vital ingredient in the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis its primary founders were sewall wright j b s haldane and ronald fisher who also laid the foundations for the related discipline of quantitative genetics traditionally a highly mathematical discipline modern population genetics encompasses theoretical lab and field work population genetic models are used both for statistical inference from dna sequence data and for proof disproof of concept what sets population genetics apart today from newer more phenotypic approaches to modelling evolution such as evolutionary game theory and adaptive dynamics is its emphasis on genetic phenomena as dominance epistasis and the degree to which genetic recombination breaks up linkage disequilibrium this makes it appropriate for comparison to population genomics data population genetics began as a reconciliation of mendelian inheritance and biostatistics models natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population before the discovery of mendelian genetics one common hypothesis was blending inheritance but with blending inheritance genetic variance would be rapidly lost making evolution by natural or sexual selection implausible the hardy weinberg principle

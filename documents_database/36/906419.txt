this tight regulation is referred to as glucose homeostasis insulin which lowers blood sugar and glucagon which raises it are the most well known of the hormones involved but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process blood sugar levels are regulated by negative feedback in order to keep the body in balance the levels of glucose in the blood are monitored by many tissues but the cells in the pancreatic islets are among the most well understood and important if the blood glucose level falls to dangerous levels as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods the alpha cells of the pancreas release glucagon a hormone whose effects on liver cells act to increase blood glucose levels they convert glycogen into glucose this process is called glycogenolysis the glucose is released into the bloodstream increasing blood sugar hypoglycemia the state of having low blood sugar is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the ingestion or administration of dextrose or carbohydrate foods it is often self diagnosed and self medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals in more severe circumstances it is treated by injection

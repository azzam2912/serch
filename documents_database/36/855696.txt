the differences between the two species are subtle the male tail in c briggsae has a slightly different morphology from c elegans other differences include changes in vulval precursor competence and the placement of the excretory duct opening c briggsae is frequently used to study the differences between it and the more intimately understood c elegans especially at the dna and protein sequence level several mutant strains of c briggsae have also been isolated that facilitate genetic analysis of this organism c briggsae like c elegans is a hermaphrodite the genome sequence for c briggsae was determined in 2003 c briggsae was initially discovered by margaret briggs in 1944 the first individuals were isolated from a pile of leaves found on the palo alto campus of stanford university briggs who was studying for her ms identified the nematodes as an unknown species of the genus rhabditis they were formally described in 1949 by dougherty and nigon and named rhabditis briggsae both c briggsae and c elegans then known as rhabditis elegans were placed into a new subgenus caenorhabditis in 1952 the subgenus was later elevated to a genus in 1955 briggs initial work with the organism looked at its lifecycle

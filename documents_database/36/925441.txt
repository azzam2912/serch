it is in humans encoded by the 2 5 kb aanat gene containing four exons located on chromosome 17q25 the gene is translated into a 23 kda large enzyme it is well conserved through evolution and the human form of the protein is 80 identical to sheep and rat aanat it is an acetyl coa dependent enzyme of the gcn5 related family of n acetyltransferases gnats it may contribute to multifactorial genetic diseases such as altered behavior in sleep wake cycle and research is on going with the aim of developing drugs that regulate aanat function the systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl coa 2 arylethylamine n acetyltransferase other names in common use include the officially accepted name is aralkylamine n acetyltransferase the aanat mrna transcript is mainly expressed in the central nervous system cns it is detectable at low levels in several brain regions including the pituitary gland as well as in the retina it is most highly abundant in the pineal gland which is the site of melatonin synthesis brain and pituitary aanat may be involved in the modulation of serotonin dependent aspects of human behavior and pituitary function in the pinealocyte cells of the pineal

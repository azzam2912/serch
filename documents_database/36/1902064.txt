they were first described by michael goldberg 1902 1990 in 1937 they are defined by three properties each face is either a pentagon or hexagon exactly three faces meet at each vertex and they have rotational icosahedral symmetry they are not necessarily mirror symmetric e g gp 5 3 and gp 3 5 are enantiomorphs of each other a consequence of euler s polyhedron formula is that there will be exactly twelve pentagons icosahedral symmetry ensures that the pentagons are always regular and that there are always 12 of them although many of the hexagons may not be regular typically all of the vertices lie on a sphere but they can also be computed as equilateral it is a dual polyhedron of a geodesic sphere with all triangle faces and 6 triangles per vertex except for 12 vertices with 5 triangles simple examples of goldberg polyhedra include the dodecahedron and truncated icosahedron other forms can be described by taking a chess knight move from one pentagon to the next first take m steps in one direction then turn 60 to the left and take n steps such a polyhedron is denoted gp m n a dodecahedron is gp 1 0

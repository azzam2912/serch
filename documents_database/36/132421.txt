when defined as a walk in a space of dimension greater than one the steps made are in isotropic random directions the term l vy flight was coined by beno t mandelbrot who used this for one specific definition of the distribution of step sizes he used the term cauchy flight for the case where the distribution of step sizes is a cauchy distribution and rayleigh flight for when the distribution is a normal distribution which is not an example of a heavy tailed probability distribution later researchers have extended the use of the term l vy flight to include cases where the random walk takes place on a discrete grid rather than on a continuous space the particular case for which mandelbrot used the term l vy flight is defined by the survivor function commonly known as the survival function of the distribution of step sizes u being here d is a parameter related to the fractal dimension and the distribution is a particular case of the pareto distribution later researchers allow the distribution of step sizes to be any distribution for which the survival function has a power like tail for some k satisfying 1 big o notation

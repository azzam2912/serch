it simplifies calculating accurate values by hand its interest today is chiefly historical but it can be used to quickly estimate these statistics there are other rapid calculation methods which are more suited for computers which also ensure more accurate results than the obvious methods first the mean of the following numbers is sought suppose we start with a plausible initial guess that the mean is about 240 then the deviations from this assumed mean are the following in adding these up one finds that and so on we are left with a sum of 30 the average of these 15 deviations from the assumed mean is therefore 30 15 2 therefore that is what we need to add to the assumed mean to get the correct mean the method depends on estimating the mean and rounding to an easy value to calculate with this value is then subtracted from all the sample values when the samples are classed into equal size ranges a central class is chosen and the count of ranges from that is used in the calculations for example for people s heights a value of 1 75m might be used as the assumed mean for a

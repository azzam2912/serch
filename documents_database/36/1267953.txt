its vertex figure is a birectified 7 simplex this polytope along with the demiocteract can tessellate 8 dimensional space represented by the symbol 1 and coxeter dynkin diagram the 17280 vertices can be defined as sign and location permutations of all sign combinations 32 280 32 8960 vertices half of the sign combinations 128 1 8 56 128 8320 vertices the edge length is 2 in this coordinate set and the polytope radius is 4 it is created by a wythoff construction upon a set of 8 hyperplane mirrors in 8 dimensional space the facet information can be extracted from its coxeter dynkin diagram removing the node on the end of the 2 length branch leaves the 7 demicube 1 removing the node on the end of the 4 length branch leaves the 1 the vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node this makes the birectified 7 simplex 0 seen in a configuration matrix the element counts can be derived by mirror removal and ratios of coxeter group orders orthographic projections are shown for the sub symmetries of e e e b b b b b b b a and a coxeter planes

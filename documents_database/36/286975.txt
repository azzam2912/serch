it was a screw gun design where the barrel could be separated into two parts via a screw joint this allowed for the gun to have a heavier barrel but still be broken into smaller portions for transport by mule teams this was important for a weapon designed to be used in mountainous and rough terrain or where adequate vehicle and horse transport was not readily available the weapon could be carried by six mules or towed the gun was adopted in 1911 and began entering service in 1914 the weapon served primarily with the indian mountain artillery in the northwest portion of british indian territory on what is now the border between pakistan and afghanistan and participated in british led military action in that theatre it also served in mesopotamia and the salonika front during world war i due to its specialised nature the gun was produced in only limited numbers with just 183 manufactured during the war it was superseded at the end of world war i by the qf 3 7 inch mountain howitzer a 2 75 inch mountain gun is on display at the heugh battery museum hartlepool

this is sometimes contrasted with a so called objective test self report test which adopt a structured approach as responses are analyzed according to a presumed universal standard for example a multiple choice exam and are limited to the content of the test the responses to projective tests are content analyzed for meaning rather than being based on presuppositions about meaning as is the case with objective tests projective tests have their origins in psychoanalysis which argues that humans have conscious and unconscious attitudes and motivations that are beyond or hidden from conscious awareness the general theoretical position behind projective tests is that whenever a specific question is asked the response will be consciously formulated and socially determined these responses do not reflect the respondent s unconscious or implicit attitudes or motivations the respondent s deep seated motivations may not be consciously recognized by the respondent or the respondent may not be able to verbally express them in the form and structure demanded by the questioner advocates of projective tests stress that the ambiguity of the stimuli presented within the tests allow subjects to express thoughts that originate on a deeper level than tapped by explicit questions and provide content

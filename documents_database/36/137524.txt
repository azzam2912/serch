it means that a program can be designed to read generate analyze or transform other programs and even modify itself while running in some cases this allows programmers to minimize the number of lines of code to express a solution in turn reducing development time it also allows programs greater flexibility to efficiently handle new situations without recompilation metaprogramming can be used to move computations from run time to compile time to generate code using compile time computations and to enable self modifying code the language in which the metaprogram is written is called the metalanguage the language of the programs that are manipulated is called the attribute oriented programming language the ability of a programming language to be its own metalanguage is called reflection or reflexivity reflection is a valuable language feature to facilitate metaprogramming metaprogramming was popular in the 1970s and 1980s using list processing languages such as lisp lisp hardware machines were popular in the 1980s and enabled applications that could process code they were frequently used for artificial intelligence applications metaprogramming enables developers to write programs and develop code that falls under the generic programming paradigm having the programming language itself as a first class data

it has been shown that kynurenic acid possesses neuroactive activity it acts as an antiexcitotoxic and anticonvulsant most likely through acting as an antagonist at excitatory amino acid receptors because of this activity it may influence important neurophysiological and neuropathological processes as a result kynurenic acid has been considered for use in therapy in certain neurobiological disorders conversely increased levels of kynurenic acid have also been linked to certain pathological conditions kynurenic acid was discovered in 1853 by the german chemist justus von liebig in dog urine which it was apparently named after it is formed from l kynurenine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme kynurenine oxoglutarate transaminase kyna has been proposed to act on four targets high levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in patients suffering from tick borne encephalitis schizophrenia and hiv related illnesses in all these situations increased levels were associated with confusion and psychotic symptoms kynurenic acid acts in the brain as a glycine site nmdar antagonist key in glutamatergic neurotransmission system which is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia a kynurenic acid hypothesis of schizophrenia was proposed in 2007 based on its action on midbrain dopamine activity and

it was first reported in tomatoes in 1935 and primarily affects vegetable crops though it is not generally considered an economically significant plant pathogen depending upon the host tbsv causes stunting of growth leaf mottling and deformed or absent fruit the virus is likely to be soil borne in the natural setting but can also transmitted mechanically for example through contaminated cutting tools tbsv has been used as a model system in virology research on the life cycle of plant viruses particularly in experimental infections of the model host plant nicotiana benthamiana tbsv has a broad host range under experimental conditions and has been reported to infect over 120 plant species spanning 20 families however under natural conditions its range is much narrower and generally comprises crop vegetables and ornamental plants it was first identified in tomato plants and also has been documented to affect apple artichoke cherry grapevine hops and pepper although it causes significant loss of yield in tomato plants it is not considered an economically significant pathogen it is however a very well established model system for the study of plant viruses usually through experimental infection of nicotiana benthamiana or nicotiana clevelandii relatives of tobacco plants in

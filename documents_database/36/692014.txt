the otfc processing system was developed at the canadian astronomy data centre cadc and the space telescope european coordinating facility st ecf and is implemented at both sites and at space telescope science institute stsci the otfc system currently provides data calibration for the wide field and planetary camera 2 wfpc2 and space telescope imaging spectrograph stis in the future the advanced camera for surveys acs and possibly the near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer nicmos will be supported the main goals behind the implementation of the otfc system are to take advantage of better calibration files and the much smaller storage area required if only raw files are kept in the archives the system can also offer more calibration steps than were available when the data was first released and can implement improved pipeline software currently for example hst data are calibrated as they are received at the stsci raw and calibrated data are stored in the hst archive dads frequently users must recalibrate the data at their home sites to take advantage of better calibration files or software a large fraction over 90 of the calibrated data in the hst archive could be improved by recalibration although

parallel to diastolic function the term systolic function is usually referenced in terms of the left ventricular ejection fraction lvef which is the ratio of stroke volume and end diastolic volume due to the epidemic of heart failure particularly the cases determined as diastolic heart failure it is increasingly urgent and crucial to understand the meaning of diastolic function unlike systolic function which can be simply evaluated by lvef there are no established dimensionless parameter for diastolic function assessment hence to further study diastolic function the complicated and speculative physiology must be taken into consideration how the heart works during its filling period still has many misconceptions remaining to better understand diastolic function it is crucial to realize that the left ventricle is a mechanical suction pump at and for a little while after the mitral valve opening in other words when mitral valve opens the atrium does not push blood into the ventricle instead it is the ventricle that mechanically sucks in blood from the atrium the energy that drives the suction process is generated from phase of systole during systole to overcome the peripheral arterial load at ejection ventricle contracts which also compresses elastic tissues internal to and

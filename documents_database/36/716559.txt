this gene encodes a tetrameric mitochondrial flavoprotein which is a member of the acyl coa dehydrogenase family this enzyme catalyzes the initial step of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta oxidation pathway the acads gene associated with short chain acyl coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency the acads gene is approximately 13 kb in length and has 10 exons the coding sequence of this gene is 1239 bp long the encoded protein has 412 amino acids and its size is 44 3 kda human or 44 9 kda mouse the scad enzyme catalyzes the first part of fatty acid beta oxidation by forming a c2 c3 trans double bond in the fatty acid through dehydrogenation of the flavoenzyme scad is specific to short chain fatty acids between c2 and c3 acylcoa the final result of beta oxidation is acetyl coa when there are defects that result in scad being misfolded there is an increased production of reactive oxygen species ros the increased ros forces the mitochondria to undergo fission and the mitochondrial reticulum takes on a grain like structure mutations of the acads gene are associated with deficiency of the short chain acyl coenzyme a dehydrogenase protein scadd this is also known as

the basic spacecraft was built of standardized components and modules for cost reduction the computer had 18 bits of core memory or plated wire memory up to 64 k 18 bits was chosen because it gave more accuracy x4 for data over a 16 bit machine floating point was not supported the nssc 1 was used on the and other missions that were mostly limited to the solar system the hardware was developed by westinghouse and gsfc the machine used diode transistor logic the lowest power parts available at the time on the preferred parts list initially fabricated from 1700 ssi nor gate packages it was later moved to 69 msi medium scale integration chips the nssc 1 had an assembler loader simulator toolset hosted on xerox xds 930 24 bit mainframe an associated simulator ran at 1 1000 of real time the xerox computer was interfaced to a breadboard obp in a rack which of course operated at room temperature ambient conditions later the software development and validation facility sdvf added a flight dynamics simulator hosted on a pdp 11 70 minicomputer a purpose built nssc 1 flight executive was developed and used on the solar maximum mission smm

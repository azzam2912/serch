it is an electronic resource that comprises molecular and biochemical information on enzymes that have been classified by the iubmb every classified enzyme is characterized with respect to its catalyzed biochemical reaction kinetic properties of the corresponding reactants that is substrates and products are described in detail brenda contains enzyme specific data manually extracted from primary scientific literature and additional data derived from automatic information retrieval methods such as text mining it provides a web based user interface that allows a convenient and sophisticated access to the data brenda was founded in 1987 at the former german research centre for biotechnology now the helmholtz centre for infection research in braunschweig and was originally published as a series of books its name was originally an acronym for the braunschweig enzyme database from 1996 to 2007 brenda was located at the university of cologne there brenda developed into a publicly accessible enzyme information system in 2007 brenda returned to braunschweig currently brenda is maintained and further developed at the department of bioinformatics and biochemistry at the tu braunschweig a major update of the data in brenda is performed twice a year besides the upgrade of its content improvements of the user interface

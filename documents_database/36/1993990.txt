another version of the game was released by bit corporation under the name dancing plates which features oriental themed graphics and adds eight game variations dishaster was inspired by the circus tradition of keeping spinning plates suspended on poles the player controls a girl attempting to keep a group of several spinning plates balanced on poles from falling the game received negative reviews criticism focused on the game s repetition and monotony the girl can stabilize wobbling dishes by pressing the button on the controller if a plate falls the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground and a new one appears at the top of the pole the number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level there are six on the easiest setting and ten on the hardest the player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground the reviewer for tv gamer magazine wrote in 1983 dishaster may be enjoyed by very young gamers but it is not sophisticated enough for any battle hardened arcade gamers non contemporary reviews were negative author brett weiss stated that dishaster was as bad as its unfunny title implies

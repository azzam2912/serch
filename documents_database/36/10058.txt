some of these terms are used interchangeably but strictly speaking the suite is the definition of the communication protocols and the stack is the software implementation of them individual protocols within a suite are often designed with a single purpose in mind this modularization simplifies design and evaluation because each protocol module usually communicates with two others they are commonly imagined as layers in a stack of protocols the lowest protocol always deals with low level interaction with the communications hardware each higher layer adds additional capabilities user applications usually deal only with the topmost layers in practical implementation protocol stacks are often divided into three major sections media transport and applications a particular operating system or platform will often have two well defined software interfaces one between the media and transport layers and one between the transport layers and applications the media to transport interface defines how transport protocol software makes use of particular media and hardware types and is associated with a device driver for example this interface level would define how tcp ip transport software would talk to the network interface controller examples of these interfaces include odi and ndis in the microsoft windows and dos environment

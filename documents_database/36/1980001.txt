the human homolog is the nkx2 5 gene tinman is expressed in the precardiac mesoderm and is responsible for the differentiation proliferation and specification of cardiac progenitor cells this gene is named after the character tin woodman who lacks a heart homeobox genes are a group of transcription factors characterized by a homeodomain that initiates gene expression which regulates cell differentiation and development when it binds to a target promoter tinman was first isolated in drosophila and many vertebrate homologs have been discovered since and are considered part of a multigene family in vertebrates the human homolog is nkx2 5 tinman is dependent upon the jak stat signalling of the precardiac mesoderm to differentiate into a more confined growth pattern for development of visceral mesoderm and the heart it contributes to the looping of the heart during fetal cardiac development but has also been found to contribute to the regulation of the heart s electrical system postnatally 4 tinman is expressed very early in drosophila during the development of the embryonic mesoderm and is required for formation of the visceral and cardiac mesoderm it is expressed transiently in the visceral mesoderm but continues to be expressed in the cardiac mesoderm

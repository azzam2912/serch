synaptic plasticity is typically input specific i e homosynaptic plasticity meaning that the activity in a particular neuron alters the efficacy of a synaptic connection between that neuron and its target however in the case of heterosynaptic plasticity the activity of a particular neuron leads to input unspecific changes in the strength of synaptic connections from other unactivated neurons a number of distinct forms of heterosynaptic plasticity have been found in a variety of brain regions and organisms these different forms of heterosynaptic plasticity contribute to a variety of neural processes including associative learning the development of neural circuits and homeostasis of synaptic input heterosynaptic plasticity may play an important homeostatic role in neural plasticity by normalizing or limiting the total change of synaptic input during ongoing hebbian plasticity hebbian plasticity an ubiquitous form of homosynaptic associative plasticity is believed to underlie learning and memory moreover hebbian plasticity is induced by and amplifies correlations in neural circuits which creates a positive feedback loop and renders neural circuits unstable to avoid this instability hebbian plasticity needs to be constrained for instance by the conservation of the total amount of synaptic input this role is believed to be fulfilled by a diversity

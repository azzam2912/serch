the coating turns black in the areas where it is heated producing an image two color direct thermal printers can print both black and an additional color often red by applying heat at two different temperatures thermal transfer printing is a very different method that uses a heat sensitive ribbon instead of heat sensitive paper but uses similar thermal print heads a thermal printer comprises these key components in order to print thermo sensitive paper is inserted between the thermal head and the platen the printer sends an electric current to the heating elements of the thermal head which generate heat the heat activates the thermo sensitive coloring layer of the thermosensitive paper which changes color where heated such a printing mechanism is known as a thermal system or direct system the heating elements are usually arranged as a line of small closely spaced dots the paper is impregnated with a solid state mixture of a dye and a suitable matrix a combination of a fluoran leuco dye and an octadecylphosphonic acid is an example when the matrix is heated above its melting point the dye reacts with the acid shifts to its colored form and the changed form is

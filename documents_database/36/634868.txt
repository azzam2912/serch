a version was developed by ernest f swinney harry ferreira and louis e swinney in the usa in 1962 the gyro monorail was never developed beyond the prototype stage the principal advantage of the monorail cited by shilovsky is the suppression of hunting oscillation a speed limitation encountered by conventional railways at the time also sharper turns are possible compared to the 7 km radius of turn typical of modern high speed trains such as the tgv because the vehicle will bank automatically on bends like an aircraft so that no lateral centrifugal acceleration is experienced on board a major drawback is that many cars including passenger and freight cars not just the locomotive would require a constantly powered gyroscope to stay upright unlike other means of maintaining balance such as lateral shifting of the centre of gravity or the use of reaction wheels the gyroscopic balancing system is statically stable so that the control system serves only to impart dynamic stability the active part of the balancing system is therefore more accurately described as a roll damper the image in the leader section depicts the 22 tonne unladen weight prototype vehicle developed by louis philip brennan cb brennan filed

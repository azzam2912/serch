thermophotonics was first publicly proposed by solar photovoltaic researcher martin green in 2000 however no tpx device is known to have been demonstrated to date apparently because of the stringent requirement on the emitter efficiency a tpx system consists of a light emitting diode led though other types of emitters are conceivable a photovoltaic pv cell an optical coupling between the two and an electronic control circuit the led is heated to a temperature higher than the pv temperature by an external heat source if no power is applied to the led the system functions much like a very inefficient tpv system but if a forward bias is applied at some fraction of the bandgap potential an increased number of electron hole pairs ehps will be thermally excited to the bandgap energy these ehps can then recombine radiatively so that the led emits light at a rate higher than the thermal radiation rate superthermal emission this light is then delivered to the cooler pv cell over the optical coupling and converted to electricity the control circuit presents a load to the pv cell presumably at the maximum power point and converts this voltage to a voltage level that can be

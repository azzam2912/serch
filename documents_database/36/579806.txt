more precisely it is a set of first order formulas in a language l with free variables x x x that are true of a sequence of elements of an l structure formula 1 depending on the context types can be complete or partial and they may use a fixed set of constants a from the structure formula 1 the question of which types represent actual elements of formula 1 leads to the ideas of saturated models and omitting types consider a structure formula 1 for a language l let m be the universe of the structure for every a m let l a be the language obtained from l by adding a constant c for every a a in other words a 1 type of formula 1 over a is a set p x of formulas in l a with at most one free variable x therefore 1 type such that for every finite subset p x p x there is some b m depending on p x with formula 7 i e all formulas in p x are true in formula 1 when x is replaced by b similarly an n type of formula 1 over a is

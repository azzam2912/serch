ranging in displacement from the h family was a modern all aluminum engine with dual overhead cams 24 valves and direct fuel injection it was co developed with mazda and toyota which used a similar design in their 2 0 l kf v6 and the toyota vz engine the h family was introduced in 1994 with the h20 but suzuki toyota and mazda s designs diverged greatly with the former increasing displacement and the latter experimenting with alternative induction technologies and smaller engine sizes the h20a displaces bore and stroke is with a 9 5 1 compression ratio it produces at 6 500 rpm and at 4 000 rpm applications the h25a displaces bore and stroke is and produced when first introduced with a 9 5 1 compression ratio it produced at 6 500 rpm and at 3 500 rpm on its introduction with a 2001 update increasing this to and it is also being considered and used for various ultra light aircraft propulsion systems applications the h27a is a modern version of the h25a a reliable displacing coming from an bore and stroke added vvt in 2006 the engine is tuned to achieve most of its torque at low

ates is applied to provide heating and cooling to buildings storage and recovery of thermal energy is achieved by extraction and injection of groundwater from aquifers using groundwater wells systems commonly operate in a seasonal mode the groundwater that is extracted in summer is used for cooling by transferring heat from the building to the groundwater by means of a heat exchanger subsequently the heated groundwater is injected back into the aquifer which creates a storage of heated groundwater in wintertime the flow direction is reversed such that the heated groundwater is extracted and can be used for heating often in combination with a heat pump therefore operating an ates system uses the subsurface as a temporal storage to buffer seasonal variations in heating and cooling demand when replacing traditional fossil fuel dependent heating and cooling systems ates can serve as a cost effective technology to reduce the primary energy consumption of a building and the associated co2 emissions in 2009 united nations climate change conference in copenhagen denmark many countries and regions have made targets for global climate protection the european union also set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions increase use of sustainable energy and improve energy

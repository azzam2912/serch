it has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic sl651498 is a subtype selective gaba agonist which acts as a full agonist at and subtypes and as a partial agonist at and although its action at subtypes is much weaker than at the others in animal studies it has primarily anxiolytic effects although some sedation ataxia and muscle relaxant effects are observed at higher doses it substitutes fully for the anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide but only partially substituted for the imidazopyridine hypnotic drug zolpidem and the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam when given repeatedly it failed to produce tolerance or dependence probably due to its low affinity and efficacy at the subtype sl651498 has been suggested for development as a novel non sedating anxiolytic drug for humans although it is still only at an early stage of research preliminary human trials suggest similar efficacy to lorazepam as an anxiolytic but with little or no sedation or impairment of memory motor skills or cognitive function there are other possibly anxioselective compounds in development such as l 838 417 ngd 91 3

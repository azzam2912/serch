early july 25 1922 january 12 2004 was an american engineer best known for his work on transistors and charge coupled device imagers he is also known as jim early he was born on july 25 1922 in syracuse new york he received an mse degree 1948 and his ph d 1951 all from ohio state university the early effect in bipolar junction transistors is named after jim early who first characterized it and published a paper on it in 1952 the early effect in bipolar junction transistors is due to an effective decrease in the base width because of the widening of the base collector depletion region resulting in an increase in the collector current with an increase in the collector voltage the same type of length modulation in mosfets is also commonly referred to as early effect early was the first to make a transistor that would oscillate faster than a thousand megacycles 1 ghz circa 1952 for which feat he won a bottle of scotch whisky from john robinson pierce he also developed the transistors for america s first commercial communications satellite the telstar i he was elevated to ieee fellow in the early 1970s early led

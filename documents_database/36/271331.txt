some modes of locomotion are initially self propelled e g running swimming jumping flying hopping soaring and gliding there are also many animal species that depend on their environment for transportation a type of mobility called passive locomotion e g sailing some jellyfish kiting spiders rolling some beetles and spiders or riding other animals phoresis animals move for a variety of reasons such as to find food a mate a suitable microhabitat or to escape predators for many animals the ability to move is essential for survival and as a result natural selection has shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms used by moving organisms for example migratory animals that travel vast distances such as the arctic tern typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance whereas non migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to escape predators are likely to have energetically costly but very fast locomotion the anatomical structures that animals use for movement including cilia legs wings arms fins or tails are sometimes referred to as locomotory organs or locomotory structures the term locomotion is formed in english from latin loco from a place ablative of locus place motio motion a moving animals

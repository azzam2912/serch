for example when melting 1 kg of ice at 0 c under a 333 55 kj of energy is absorbed with no temperature change the heat of solidification when a substance changes from liquid to solid is equal and opposite this energy includes the contribution required to make room for any associated change in volume by displacing its environment against ambient pressure the temperature at which the phase transition occurs is the melting point or the freezing point according to context by convention the pressure is assumed to be unless otherwise specified the enthalpy of fusion is a latent heat because during melting the heat energy needed to change the substance from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure is latent heat of fusion as the temperature remains constant during the process the latent heat of fusion is the enthalpy change of any amount of substance when it melts when the heat of fusion is referenced to a unit of mass it is usually called the specific heat of fusion while the molar heat of fusion refers to the enthalpy change per amount of substance in moles the liquid phase has a higher internal energy than the solid phase this means

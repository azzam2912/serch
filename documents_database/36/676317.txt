often abbreviated hn1 it is a powerful vesicant and a nitrogen mustard gas used for chemical warfare hn1 was developed in the 1920s and 1930s to remove warts and later as a military agent because of the latter use it is a schedule 1 chemical within the chemical weapons convention and therefore use and production is strongly restricted it has never been used in warfare it is an oily liquid with a colorless to pale yellow appearance and a faint fishy or musty odor hn1 is also an alkylating agent nitrogen mustards react via an initial cyclization to the corresponding aziridinium salt the rate of this reaction is ph dependent because the protonated amine cannot cyclize the aziridinium ion reacts with water in a slower reaction at ph 8 the nitrogen mustards are essentially quantitatively converted to the aziridinium ion for subsequent slow reaction with water in contrast at ph 4 cyclization and hydrolysis show the classic form of reactions in series hydrolysis of hn1 produces toxic intermediates hn1 reacts with iron alloys corroding them at and above 65 c 149 f and reacts with metals in general producing hydrogen gas this can potentially cause explosions because hn1 is an

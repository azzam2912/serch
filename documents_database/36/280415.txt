gollin born may 6 1953 is an american physics professor at the university of illinois at urbana champaign besides his work on particle physics and the international linear collider he has since 2003 made numerous efforts in fighting institutions which are considered to be diploma mills which has caused him to receive significant public attention gollin placed second in the 2014 democratic primary for illinois s 13th congressional district gollin has worked on particle physics experiments studying muon scattering 1975 1981 intended to test the ideas of quantum chromodynamics neutral k meson decay parameters 1980 1993 measuring things relating to cp violation and electron positron annihilation 1993 2005 measuring production and decay properties of heavy quarks his current research focuses on technical issues associated with the design and construction of the international linear collider a very large electron positron colliding beams facility intended to shed light on the origins of the masses of the fundamental particles his teaching has spanned the entire physics curriculum from elementary algebra based courses for students in the life sciences to classical electrodynamics at the graduate level the university of illinois is a public university and land grant school as such gollin s responsibilities include

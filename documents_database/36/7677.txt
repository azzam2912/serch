the audio signal is commonly recorded on a vtr track or other storage media the bits are encoded using the biphase mark code also known as fm a 0 bit has a single transition at the start of the bit period a 1 bit has two transitions at the beginning and middle of the period this encoding is self clocking each frame is terminated by a sync word which has a special predefined sync relationship with any video or film content a special bit in the linear timecode frame the biphase mark correction bit ensures that there are an even number of ac transitions in each timecode frame the sound of linear timecode is a jarring and distinctive noise and has been used as a sound effects shorthand to imply telemetry or computers in broadcast video situations the ltc generator should be tied into house black burst as should all devices using timecode to ensure correct color framing and correct synchronization of all digital clocks when synchronizing multiple clock dependent digital devices together with video such as digital audio recorders the devices must be connected to a common word clock signal that is derived from the house black burst signal

the type locality is near the city of monterey california the monterey formation is the major source rock for 37 to 38 billion barrels of oil in conventional traps such as sandstones this is most of california s known oil resources the monterey has been extensively investigated and mapped for petroleum potential and is of major importance for understanding the complex geological history of california its rocks are mostly highly siliceous strata that vary greatly in composition stratigraphy and tectono stratigraphic history the us energy information administration eia estimated in 2014 that the 1 750 square mile monterey formation could yield about 600 million barrels of oil from tight oil contained in the formation down sharply from their 2011 estimate of a potential 15 4 billion barrels an independent review by the california council on science and technology found both of these estimates to be highly uncertain despite intense industry efforts there has been little success to date 2013 in producing monterey hosted tight oil shale oil except in places where it is already naturally fractured and it may be many years if ever before the monterey becomes a significant producer of shale oil the monterey formation strata vary its

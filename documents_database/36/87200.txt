rician fading occurs when one of the paths typically a line of sight signal or some strong reflection signals is much stronger than the others in rician fading the amplitude gain is characterized by a rician distribution rayleigh fading is the specialised model for stochastic fading when there is no line of sight signal and is sometimes considered as a special case of the more generalised concept of rician fading in rayleigh fading the amplitude gain is characterized by a rayleigh distribution rician fading itself is a special case of two wave with diffuse power twdp fading a rician fading channel can be described by two parameters formula 1 and formula 2 formula 1 is the ratio between the power in the direct path and the power in the other scattered paths formula 2 is the total power from both paths formula 5 and acts as a scaling factor to the distribution the received signal amplitude not the received signal power formula 6 is then rice distributed with parameters formula 7 and formula 8 the resulting pdf then is where formula 10 is the 0th order modified bessel function of the first kind

it is also known as 8 annulene this polyunsaturated hydrocarbon is a colorless to light yellow flammable liquid at room temperature because of its stoichiometric relationship to benzene cot has been the subject of much research and some controversy unlike benzene ch cyclooctatetraene ch is not aromatic although its dianion cyclooctatetraenide is its reactivity is characteristic of an ordinary polyene i e it undergoes addition reactions benzene by contrast characteristically undergoes substitution reactions not additions 1 3 5 7 cyclooctatetraene was initially synthesized by richard willst tter in munich in 1905 using pseudopelletierine as the starting material and the hofmann elimination as the key transformation willst tter noted that the compound did not exhibit the expected aromaticity between 1939 and 1943 chemists throughout the us unsuccessfully attempted to synthesize cot they rationalized their lack of success with the conclusion that willst tter had not actually synthesized the compound but instead its isomer styrene willst tter responded to these reviews in his autobiography where he noted that the american chemists were untroubled by the reduction of his cyclooctatetraene to cyclooctane a reaction impossible for styrene during world war 2 walter reppe at basf ludwigshafen developed a simple one step synthesis of

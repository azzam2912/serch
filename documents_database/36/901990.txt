in the complex numbers there is already a canonical exponential function the function that maps x to e in this setting the term exponential polynomial is often used to mean polynomials of the form p x e where p c x y is a polynomial in two variables there is nothing particularly special about c here exponential polynomials may also refer to such a polynomial on any exponential field or exponential ring with its exponential function taking the place of e above similarly there is no reason to have one variable and an exponential polynomial in n variables would be of the form p x x e e where p is a polynomial in 2 n variables for formal exponential polynomials over a field k we proceed as follows let w be a finitely generated z submodule of k and consider finite sums of the form where the f are polynomials in k x and the exp w x are formal symbols indexed by w in w subject to exp u v exp u exp v a more general framework where the term exponential polynomial may be found is that of exponential functions on abelian groups similarly to how exponential

it is the pressure resulting from a force of one pound force applied to an area of one square inch in si units 1 psi is approximately equal to 6895 n m pounds per square inch absolute psia is used to make it clear that the pressure is relative to a vacuum rather than the ambient atmospheric pressure since atmospheric pressure at sea level is around 14 7 psi this will be added to any pressure reading made in air at sea level the converse is pounds per square inch gauge psig indicating that the pressure is relative to atmospheric pressure for example a bicycle tire pumped up to 65 psig in a local atmospheric pressure at sea level 14 7 psia will have a pressure of 79 7 psia 14 7 psi 65 psi when gauge pressure is referenced to something other than ambient atmospheric pressure then the units would be pounds per square inch differential psid the kilopound per square inch ksi is a scaled unit derived from psi equivalent to a thousand psi 1000 lbf in ksi are not widely used for gas pressures they are mostly used in materials science where the tensile strength of a

ancestral relations make their first appearance in frege s begriffsschrift frege later employed them in his grundgesetze as part of his definition of the finite cardinals hence the ancestral was a key part of his search for a logicist foundation of arithmetic the numbered propositions below are taken from his begriffsschrift and recast in contemporary notation a property p is called r hereditary if whenever x is p and xry holds then y is also p frege defined b to be an r ancestor of a written arb if b has every r hereditary property that all objects x such that arx have the ancestral is a transitive relation let the notation i r denote that r is functional frege calls such relations many one if r is functional then the ancestral of r is what nowadays is called connected the ancestral relation formula 6 is equal to the transitive closure formula 7 of formula 8 indeed formula 6 is transitive see 98 above formula 6 contains formula 8 indeed if arb then of course b has every r hereditary property that all objects x such that arx have because b is one of them and finally formula 6 is

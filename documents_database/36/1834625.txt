the word is a pure morphic or pure substitutive word note that it is the limit of the sequence a f a f f a f f f a it is clearly a fixed point of the endomorphism f the unique such sequence beginning with the letter a in general a morphic word is the image of a pure morphic word under a coding if a morphic word is constructed as the fixed point of a prolongable k uniform morphism on a then the word is k automatic the n th term in such a sequence can be produced by a finite state automaton reading the digits of n in base k a d0l system deterministic context free lindenmayer system is given by a word w of the free monoid a on an alphabet a together with a morphism prolongable at w the system generates the infinite d0l word lim w purely morphic words are d0l words but not conversely however if u is an infinite d0l word with an initial segment u of length u w then z is a purely morphic word where z is a letter not in a

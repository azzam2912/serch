in earthquake engineering plastic hinge is also a type of energy damping device allowing plastic rotation deformation of an otherwise rigid column connection in plastic limit analysis of structural members subjected to bending it is assumed that an abrupt transition from elastic to ideally plastic behaviour occurs at a certain value of moment known as plastic moment m member behaviour between m and m is considered to be elastic when m is reached a plastic hinge is formed in the member in contrast to a frictionless hinge permitting free rotation it is postulated that the plastic hinge allows large rotations to occur at constant plastic moment m plastic hinges extend along short lengths of beams actual values of these lengths depend on cross sections and load distributions but detailed analyses have shown that it is sufficiently accurate to consider beams rigid plastic with plasticity confined to plastic hinges at points while this assumption is sufficient for limit state analysis finite element formulations are available to account for the spread of plasticity along plastic hinge lengths by inserting a plastic hinge at a plastic limit load into a statically determinate beam a kinematic mechanism permitting an unbounded displacement of the system

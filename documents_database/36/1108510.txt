while protein kinase a pka or camp dependent protein kinase and cyclic nucleotide regulated ion channel cng and hcn were initially unveiled in 1968 and 1985 respectively epac genes were discovered in 1998 independently by two research groups kawasaki et al identified camp gefi and camp gefii as novel genes enriched in brain using a differential display protocol and by screening clones with camp binding motif de rooij and colleagues performed a database search for proteins with sequence homology to both gefs for ras and rap1 and to camp binding sites which led to the identification and subsequent cloning of rapgef3 gene the discovery of epac family camp sensors suggests that the complexity and possible readouts of camp signaling are much more elaborate than previously envisioned this is due to the fact that the net physiological effects of camp entail the integration of epac and pka dependent pathways which may act independently converge synergistically or oppose each other in regulating a specific cellular function human rapgef3 gene is present on chromosome 12 12q13 11 47 734 367 47 771 041 out of the many predicted transcript variants three that are validated in the ncbi database include transcript variant 1 6

in the model the real polyion chain is replaced by an idealized line charge where the polyion is represented by a uniformly charged thread of zero radius infinite length and finite charge density and the condensed counterion layer is assumed to be in physical equilibrium with the ionic atmosphere surrounding the polyion the uncondensed mobile ions in the ionic atmosphere are treated within the debye h ckel dh approximation the phenomenon of counterion condensation now takes place when the dimensionless coulomb coupling strength where formula 2 represents the bjerrum length and formula 3 the distance between neighboring charged monomers in this case the coulomb interactions dominate over the thermal interactions and counterion condensation is favored for many standard polyelectrolytes this phenomenon is relevant since the distance between neighboring monomer charges typically ranges between 2 and 3 and formula 4 7 in water in the case of the chondroitin sulfate cs systems which is a major biopolyelectrolyte controlling the frictional compressive properties of articular cartilage the coulomb coupling strength is formula 5 1 4 which implies that according to manning s theory counterion condensation should take place however since manning s theory does not take into account the molecular details of

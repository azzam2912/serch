the former is more common inorganic lead iv compounds are typically strong oxidants or exist only in highly acidic solutions various oxidized forms of lead are easily reduced to the metal an example is heating pbo with mild organic reducing agents such as glucose a mixture of the oxide and the sulfide heated together will also form the metal metallic lead is attacked oxidized only superficially by air forming a thin layer of lead oxide that protects it from further oxidation the metal is not attacked by sulfuric or hydrochloric acids it dissolves in nitric acid with the evolution of nitric oxide gas to form dissolved pb no when heated with nitrates of alkali metals metallic lead oxidizes to form pbo also known as litharge leaving the corresponding alkali nitrite pbo is representative of lead s 2 oxidation state it is soluble in nitric and acetic acids from which solutions it is possible to precipitate halide sulfate chromate carbonate pbco and basic carbonate salts of lead the sulfide can also be precipitated from acetate solutions these salts are all poorly soluble in water among the halides the iodide is less soluble than the bromide which in turn is less soluble

more than 14 million images have been hand annotated by the project to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images bounding boxes are also provided imagenet contains more than 20 000 categories with a typical category such as balloon or strawberry consisting of several hundred images the database of annotations of third party image urls is freely available directly from imagenet though the actual images are not owned by imagenet since 2010 the imagenet project runs an annual software contest the imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge ilsvrc where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes the challenge uses a trimmed list of one thousand non overlapping classes on 30 september 2012 a convolutional neural network cnn called alexnet achieved a top 5 error of 15 3 in the imagenet 2012 challenge more than 10 8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up this was made feasible due to the use of graphics processing units gpus during training an essential ingredient of the deep learning revolution according to the economist suddenly people started to pay attention not just within the ai community but across the technology industry

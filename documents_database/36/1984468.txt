the first anti thrombin aptamer tba was generated through via selex systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technology in 1992 by l c bock j j toole and colleagues a second thrombin binding aptamer hd22 recognizes thrombin exosite ii and was discovered in 1997 by nexstar now gilead sciences these two aptamers have high affinity and good specificity and have been widely studied and used for the development of aptamer based therapeutics and diagnostics the aptamer tba also known as g15d htq hd1 or arc183 is a 15 mer single stranded dna with the sequence 5 ggttggtgtggttgg 3 it interacts with the exosite i of human alpha thrombin which is the binding site of fibrinogen so this aptamer acts as an anti coagulant agent inhibiting the activation of fibrinogen as well as platelet aggregation in addition tba shows good affinity and specificity against thrombin the dissociation constant of tba thrombin has been reported in nano molar range and tba does not interact with other plasma proteins or thrombin analogues e g gamma thrombin as a result tba has been used as a short term anti coagulant designed for the application in the coronary artery bypass graft surgery and its

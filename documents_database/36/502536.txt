cognitive robotics may be considered the engineering branch of embodied cognitive science and embodied embedded cognition while traditional cognitive modeling approaches have assumed symbolic coding schemes as a means for depicting the world translating the world into these kinds of symbolic representations has proven to be problematic if not untenable perception and action and the notion of symbolic representation are therefore core issues to be addressed in cognitive robotics cognitive robotics views animal cognition as a starting point for the development of robotic information processing as opposed to more traditional artificial intelligence techniques target robotic cognitive capabilities include perception processing attention allocation anticipation planning complex motor coordination reasoning about other agents and perhaps even about their own mental states robotic cognition embodies the behavior of intelligent agents in the physical world or a virtual world in the case of simulated cognitive robotics ultimately the robot must be able to act in the real world a preliminary robot learning technique called motor babbling involves correlating pseudo random complex motor movements by the robot with resulting visual and or auditory feedback such that the robot may begin to expect a pattern of sensory feedback given a pattern of motor output desired sensory

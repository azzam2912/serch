hoffmann la roche ltd in basel switzerland the resulting patent ch532261 was licensed worldwide to electronics and watch industries and thus initiated a paradigm change towards flat panel field effect liquid crystal lc displays in the early 1970s martin schadt started to investigate correlations between liquid crystal molecular structures material properties electro optical effects and display performance to obtain criteria for novel effect specific liquid crystal materials for tn and subsequent field effect applications his interdisciplinary approach involving physics and chemistry became the basis for modern industrial lc materials research and led to the discovery and production of numerous new functional molecules and new electro optical effects in 1970 shortly after the invention of the tn effect he developed the first commercial room temperature nematic liquid crystal mixture with positive dielectric anisotropy used in the displays of the first japanese digital tn lcd watches the pharmaceutical company roche established itself as a major supplier of liquid crystal materials for the emerging lcd industry apart from his pioneering work on the tn effect i e e twisted nematic field effect novel liquid crystal materials organic semiconductors and biophysics he invented or co invented the following effects and technologies as principal inventor

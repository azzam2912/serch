it is the property of a material whose transmittance depends on the orientation of linearly polarized light incident upon it as a technique it is primarily used to study the functionality and structure of molecules ld measurements are based on the interaction between matter and light and thus are a form of electromagnetic spectroscopy this effect has been applied across the em spectrum where different wavelengths of light can probe a host of chemical systems the predominant use of ld currently is in the study of bio macromolecules e g dna as well as synthetic polymers ld uses linearly polarized light which is light that has been polarized in one direction only this produces a wave the electric field vector which oscillates in only one plane giving rise to a classic sinusoidal wave shape as the light travels through space by using light parallel and perpendicular to the orientation direction it is possible to measure how much more energy is absorbed in one dimension of the molecule relative to the other providing information to the experimentalist as light interacts with the molecule being investigated should the molecule start absorbing the light then electron density inside the molecule will be shifted

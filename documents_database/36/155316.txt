it is thought to be caused by disorganized growth of retinal blood vessels which may result in scarring and retinal detachment rop can be mild and may resolve spontaneously but it may lead to blindness in serious cases as such all preterm babies are at risk for rop and very low birth weight is an additional risk factor both oxygen toxicity and relative hypoxia can contribute to the development of rop it was first reported by theodore l terry in 1942 by the fourth month of pregnancy the fetal retina has begun to develop vascularization such formation of blood vessels appears to be very sensitive to the amount of oxygen supplied either naturally or artificially in rare cases rop has been found in some patients with a mutation in the ndp gene which is normally associated with the more formidable norrie disease various risk factors contribute to the development of rop they are during development blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards this process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery however in premature babies it is incomplete if blood vessels grow normally rop does not occur if the vessels grow and

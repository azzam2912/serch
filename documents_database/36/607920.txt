some authors use the term pulsed dc to describe a signal consisting of one or more rectangular flat topped rather than sinusoidal pulses pulsed dc is commonly produced from ac alternating current by a half wave rectifier or a full wave rectifier full wave rectified ac is more commonly known as rectified ac pdc has some characteristics of both alternating current ac and direct current dc waveforms the voltage of a dc wave is roughly constant whereas the voltage of an ac waveform continually varies between positive and negative values like an ac wave the voltage of a pdc wave continually varies but like a dc wave the sign of the voltage is constant pulsating direct current is used on pwm controllers most modern electronic items function using a dc voltage so the pdc waveform must usually be smoothed before use a reservoir capacitor converts the pdc wave into a dc waveform with some superimposed ripple when the pdc voltage is initially applied it charges the capacitor which acts as a short term storage device to keep the output at an acceptable level while the pdc waveform is at a low voltage voltage regulation is often also applied using either

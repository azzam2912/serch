the proportionality factor is called henry s law constant it was formulated by the english chemist william henry who studied the topic in the early 19th century in his publication about the number of gases absorbed by water he described the results of his experiments water takes up of gas condensed by one two or more additional atmospheres a quantity which ordinarily compressed would be equal to twice thrice c the volume absorbed under the common pressure of the atmosphere an example where henry s law is at play is in the depth dependent dissolution of oxygen and nitrogen in the blood of underwater divers that changes during decompression leading to decompression sickness an everyday example is given by one s experience with carbonated soft drinks which contain dissolved carbon dioxide before opening the gas above the drink in its container is almost pure carbon dioxide at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure after the bottle is opened this gas escapes moving the partial pressure of carbon dioxide above the liquid to be much lower resulting in degassing as the dissolved carbon dioxide comes out of solution there are many ways to define the proportionality constant of henry s law

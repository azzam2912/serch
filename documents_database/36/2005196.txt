it shines with a combined light of apparent magnitude 5 84 which indicates it a dimly visible to the naked eye under good viewing conditions an annual parallax shift of 19 11 mas provides a distance estimate of around 171 light years it has a relatively high proper motion traversing the celestial sphere at a rate of 0 226 arcseconds per year and is moving away from the sun with a radial velocity of 31 km s this is a single lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 7 8 days and a low eccentricity of 0 023 nearly circular the visible component has a stellar classification of g0 iv matching a g type subgiant star that is exhausting the hydrogen at its core and evolving into a giant it is about two billion years old with 1 68 times the mass of the sun and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 14 5 km s the star has a higher than solar abundance of iron in its spectrum it is radiating 11 times the sun s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6 106 k

this concept extends the idea of a function of a real variable to several variables the input variables take real values while the output also called the value of the function may be real or complex however the study of the complex valued functions may be easily reduced to the study of the real valued functions by considering the real and imaginary parts of the complex function therefore unless explicitly specified only real valued functions will be considered in this article the domain of a function of n variables is the subset of for which the function is defined as usual the domain of a function of several real variables is supposed to contain an open subset of a real valued function of real variables is a function that takes as input real numbers commonly represented by the variables for producing another real number the value of the function commonly denoted for simplicity in this article a real valued function of several real variables will be simply called a function to avoid any ambiguity the other types of functions that may occur will be explicitly specified some functions are defined for all real values of the variables one says that

they are typically used to enhance the realism of polygon meshes and other forms 3d model data they associate additional properties such as advanced rendering parameters e g specularity brdf physics behavioural properties such as friction density or sound triggers alongside texture information for surfaces for example if a texture makes an object look like wood it will sound like wood if something hits it or is scraped along a surface break like wood and even float like wood if it was made of metal it will sound like metal dent like metal and sink like metal this allows more flexibility when making objects in games such materials are also of value for procedural generation where a high level description of a model may be augmented with layers of processing to produce a more detailed result e g adding weathering or vegetation material properties may also be tied to animation channels to exhibit time dependant behaviour a materials system allows a digital artist or game designer to think about objects in a different way instead of the object just being a model with a texture applied to it the object or part of the object is made up of a

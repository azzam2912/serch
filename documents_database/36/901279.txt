dialnorm stands for dialog normalization dialnorm is an integer value with range 1 to 31 corresponding to a playback gain of 30 to 0 db unity respectively higher values afford more headroom and are appropriate for dynamic material such as an action film dolby recommends that the dialnorm value be determined by measurement of average dialog level in the program the recommended metering approach uses a power sum of the a weighted audio level in all channels if every producer and distributor uses this method consumer dialog levels will be consistent from program to program and channel to channel the dialog levels will be normalized audio levels within analog disk tape and broadcasting have traditionally been adjusted to keep peak levels within the physical and legal modulation limits of the medium while this practice has resulted in relatively consistent dialog levels and has minimized audibility of channel noise it has come with a severe penalty in the form of excessive audio compression and limited dynamic range digital recording has eliminated the concern for noise but the lack of a standard for digital audio level has resulted in compact disc recordings and portable music player files with widely varying levels increasingly

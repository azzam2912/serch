it is being studied for a potential role in the treatment of left ventricular systolic heart failure systolic heart failure involves a loss of effective actin myosin cross bridges in the myocytes heart muscle cells of the left ventricle which leads to a decreased ability of the heart to move blood through the body this causes peripheral edema blood pooling which the sympathetic nervous system tries to correct by overstimulating the cardiac myocytes leading to left ventricular hypertrophy another characteristic of chronic heart failure current inotropic therapies work by increasing the force of cardiac contraction such as through calcium conduction or modulating adrenoreceptors but these are limited by adverse events including arrhythmias related to increased myocardical oxygen consumption desensitization of adrenergic receptors and altering intracellular calcium levels inotropes are also thought to be associated with worse prognosis therefore the novel mechanism of omecamtiv mecarbil may offer a useful new option for heart failure cardiac myocytes contract through a cross bridge cycle between the myofilaments actin and myosin chemical energy in the form of atp is converted into mechanical energy which allows myosin to strongly bind to actin and produce a power stroke resulting in sarcomere shortening contraction omecamtiv mecarbil specifically

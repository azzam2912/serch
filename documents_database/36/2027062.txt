in brief a lie bialgebroid are two compatible lie algebroids defined on dual vector bundles they form the vector bundle version of a lie bialgebra remember that a lie algebroid is defined as a skew symmetric operation on the sections a of a vector bundle a m over a smooth manifold m together with a vector bundle morphism a tm subject to the leibniz rule and jacobi identity where are sections of a and f is a smooth function on m the lie bracket can be extended to multivector fields a graded symmetric via the leibniz rule for a forms and it is uniquely characterized by the conditions and for functions f on m a 1 forms a and sections of a a lie bialgebroid are two lie algebroids a and a on dual vector bundles a m and a m subject to the compatibility for all sections of a here d denotes the lie algebroid differential of a which also operates on the multivector fields a it can be shown that the definition is symmetric in a and a i e a a is a lie bialgebroid iff a a is 1 a lie bialgebra are two lie algebras

it is an extension of the c programming language which strives to enable easy pram like programming based on the explicit multi threading paradigm it is developed as part of the xmt pram on chip vision by a research team at the university of maryland college park led by dr uzi vishkin the philosophy of xmtc and the whole xmt project is that parallel programming is a hard intellectual task and the approach of building a hardware system first and then figuring out how to program them has not had much success for that reason a robust algorithmic theory and a reasonably easy hardware abstraction should be the specifications that guide how to build a new parallel architecture and programming language for parallel algorithms the algorithmic theory that has the largest body of literature is called pram parallel random access machine this is not a coincidence since pram is a natural way in which to think algorithmically in parallel in the early 1990s the pram model was deemed unrealistic because the hardware abstraction it was based on could not be implemented because of low inter chip bandwidth and high latency now that multiple processors can be put on a single

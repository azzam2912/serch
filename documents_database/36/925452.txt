since they are not synthesized in the human body they must be derived from the diet tyrosine is semi essential it can be synthesized but only from phenylalanine a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase used in tyrosine synthesis causes phenylketonuria and concurrently renders tyrosine an essential amino acid amino acids do not absorb light in the visible region however aromatic amino acids absorb ultraviolet radiation above 250 nm this characteristic of aromatic amino acids is used in quantitative analysis animals obtain aromatic amino acids from their diet but all plants and micro organisms must synthesize their aromatic amino acids through the metabolically costly shikimate pathway in order to make them in plants the shikimate pathway first leads to the formation of chorismate which is the precursor of phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan these aromatic amino acids are the derivatives of many secondary metabolites all essential to a plant s biological functions such as the hormones salicylate and auxin this pathway contains enzymes that can be regulated by inhibitors which can cease the production of chorismate and ultimately the organism s biological functions herbicides and antibiotics work by inhibiting these enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids thereby rendering

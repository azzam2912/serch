it was set up as a result of the failure of all six stream ciphers submitted to the nessie project the call for primitives was first issued in november 2004 the project was completed in april 2008 the project was divided into separate phases and the project goal was to find algorithms suitable for different application profiles the submissions to estream fall into either or both of two profiles both profiles contain an a subcategory 1a and 2a with ciphers that also provide authentication in addition to encryption in phase 3 none of the ciphers providing authentication are being considered the nls cipher had authentication removed from it to improve its performance the following ciphers make up the estream portfolio these are all free for any use rabbit was the only one that had a patent pending during the estream competition but it was released into the public domain in october 2008 the original portfolio published at the end of phase 3 consisted of the above ciphers plus f fcsr which was in profile 2 however cryptanalysis of f fcsr led to a revision of the portfolio in september 2008 which removed that cipher phase 1 included a general analysis

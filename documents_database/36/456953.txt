one abampere is equal to ten amperes in the si system of units an abampere of current in a circular path of one centimeter radius produces a magnetic field of 2 oersteds at the center of the circle the name abampere was introduced by kennelly in 1903 as a short name for the long name absolute electromagnetic cgs unit of current that was in use since the adoption of the cgs system in 1875 the abampere was coherent with the emu cgs system in contrast to the ampere the practical unit of current that had been adopted too in 1875 the emu cgs or electromagnetic cgs units are one of several systems of electromagnetic units within the centimetre gram second system of units others include esu cgs gaussian units and lorentz heaviside units in these other systems the abampere is not one of the units the statcoulomb per second or statampere is used instead the other units in this system related to the abampere are

in addition it plays a major role in the development of the neurons that transmit pain it belongs to the runt related transcription factor runx family of genes which are also called core binding factor cbf runx proteins form a heterodimeric complex with cbf which confers increased dna binding and stability to the complex chromosomal translocations involving the runx1 gene are associated with several types of leukemia including m2 aml mutations in runx1 are implicated in cases of breast cancer in humans the gene runx1 is 260 kilobases kb in length and is located on chromosome 21 21q22 12 the gene can be transcribed from 2 alternative promoters promoter 1 distal or promoter 2 proximal as a result various isoforms of runx1 can be synthesized facilitated by alternative splicing the full length runx1 protein is encoded by 12 exons among the exons are two defined domains namely the runt homology domain rhd or the runt domain exons 2 3 and 4 and the transactivation domain tad exon 6 these domains are necessary for runx1 to mediate dna binding and protein protein interactions respectively the transcription of runx1 is regulated by 2 enhancers regulatory element 1 and regulatory element 2 and

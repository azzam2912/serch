first released in 1984 it has been under continuous development in response to user feedback version 6 0 released in april 2013 added network modelling capability and new vehicle movement classes version 7 0 includes new timing analysis methods for common control groups multiple intersections operating under one signal controller and network cycle time and signal offset calculations for signal coordination the latest version 8 0 includes improved network model processing efficiency and improved workflow efficiency through substantial user interface enhancements and model improvements these include increased computing speeds for the iterative network analysis method optimum cycle time for networks and common control groups network demand and sensitivity analysis methods graphical displays of intersection geometry volumes signal phasing and movement ids in site input dialogs allowing direct data entry a large number of new reports and displays for sites networks and routes including project summary and the user report facility based on user defined report templates sidra intersection is a micro analytical traffic evaluation tool that employs lane by lane and vehicle drive cycle models it can be used to compare alternative treatments of individual intersections and networks of intersections involving signalised intersections fixed time pretimed and actuated roundabouts unsignalised

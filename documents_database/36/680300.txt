depending on the rewriting system and the object several normal forms may exist or none at all stated formally if a is an abstract rewriting system some x a is in normal form if no y a exists such that x y for example using the term rewriting system with a single rule g x y x the term g g 4 2 g 3 1 can be rewritten as follows applying the rule to the outermost occurrence of g since no rule applies to the last term 4 it cannot be rewritten any further and hence is a normal form of the term g g 4 2 g 3 1 with respect to this term rewriting system related concepts refer to the possibility of rewriting an element into normal form an object of an abstract rewrite system is said to be weakly normalizing if it can be rewritten somehow into a normal form that is if some rewrite sequence starting from it cannot be extended any further an object is said to be strongly normalizing if it can be rewritten in any way into a normal form that is if every rewrite sequence starting from it eventually cannot be

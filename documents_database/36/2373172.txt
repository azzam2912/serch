it is shaped to send more radio energy in certain directions in order to smooth out the reception pattern of objects as their range changes in relation to the radar the name refers to the fact that the amount of energy returned from a target drops off with the square of the cosecant of the angle between the radar and the target the concept originated as part of the development of the h2s radar which scanned the area under an aircraft to provide a radar map of the ground below the ground directly below the aircraft is at a distance equal to the aircraft s altitude which produces the strongest signal the terrain at further distances returns much less signal due to the radar equation the slant range distance between the radar and the terrain is the cosecant of the angle between the fuselage and the target and the energy falls off with the fourth root of that number without correction this produced a display where the ground under the aircraft was very bright on the cathode ray tube display while the terrain at longer distances was almost invisible to counteract this the scanning antenna was re aimed so that

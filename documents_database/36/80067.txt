the equation can be generalized to other observables as well it is named after adriaan fokker and max planck and is also known as the kolmogorov forward equation after andrey kolmogorov who independently discovered the concept in 1931 when applied to particle position distributions it is better known as the smoluchowski equation after marian smoluchowski and in this context it is equivalent to the convection diffusion equation the case with zero diffusion is known in statistical mechanics as the liouville equation the fokker planck equation is obtained from the master equation through kramers moyal expansion the first consistent microscopic derivation of the fokker planck equation in the single scheme of classical and quantum mechanics was performed by nikolay bogoliubov and nikolay krylov the smoluchowski equation is the fokker planck equation for the probability density function of the particle positions of brownian particles in one spatial dimension x for an it process driven by the standard wiener process formula 1 and described by the stochastic differential equation sde with drift formula 3 and diffusion coefficient formula 4 the fokker planck equation for the probability density formula 5 of the random variable formula 6 is in the following use formula 8 define

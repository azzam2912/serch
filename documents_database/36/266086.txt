as an evolving field it includes research and researchers from physics mathematics electrical engineering computer vision computer science and perceptual psychology the foundation of imaging science as a discipline is the imaging chain a conceptual model describing all of the factors which must be considered when developing a system for creating visual renderings images in general the links of the imaging chain include note that some imaging scientists will include additional links in their description of the imaging chain for example some will include the source of the energy which illuminates or interacts with the subject of the image others will include storage and or transmission systems subfields within imaging science include image processing computer vision 3d computer graphics animations atmospheric optics astronomical imaging digital image restoration digital imaging color science digital photography holography magnetic resonance imaging medical imaging microdensitometry optics photography remote sensing radar imaging radiometry silver halide ultrasound imaging photoacoustic imaging thermal imaging visual perception and various printing technologies

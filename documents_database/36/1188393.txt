this mechanism is widely viewed as the most important of the five mechanisms of adhesion due to its presence in every type of adhesive system and relative strength the source of adhesive forces according to the dispersive adhesion mechanism is the weak interactions that occur between molecules close together these interactions include london dispersion forces keesom forces debye forces and hydrogen bonds taken on an individual basis these attractions are not very strong but when summed over the bulk of a material can become significant london dispersion forces arise from instantaneous dipoles between two nonpolar molecules close together the random nature of electron orbit allows moments in which the charge distribution in a molecule is unevenly distributed allowing an attraction to another molecule with a temporary dipole a larger molecule allows for a larger dipole and thus will have stronger dispersion forces keesom forces also known as dipole dipole interactions result from two molecules that have a permanent dipole due to electronegativity differences between atoms in the molecule this dipole causes a coulombic attraction between the two molecules debye forces or dipole induced dipole interactions can also play a role in dispersive adhesion these come about when a nonpolar molecule

they were commonly used in the 1930s but were considered obsolete post war the friction disk pattern was invented by truffault before 1900 these used oiled leather friction surfaces between bronze disks compressed by adjustable conical springs with the disk pack floating between arms to both chassis and axle in the distinctive style from 1904 these were licensed to several makers including mors who had first applied shock absorbers to cars and hartford in the us similar dampers were also applied as steering dampers from this early date the dampers rely as their name suggests on the friction within a stack of disks clamped tightly together with a spring and clamp bolt the friction disk material was usually a wooden disk between the two faces of the steel arms as for the development of the clutch and brake shoes the development of these friction materials was in its infancy treated leather had been used for clutches and although it offered good friction behaviour it was prone to stiction when first moving off and also failed when overheated asbestos based friction materials were sometimes used for racing in an attempt to keep dampers working correctly even when overheating the damping force

it is part of a dimensionally infinite family of uniform polytopes called demihypercubes e l elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope labeling it as hm for a 6 dimensional half measure polytope coxeter named this polytope as 1 from its coxeter diagram with a ring on one of the 1 length branches it can named similarly by a 3 dimensional exponential schl fli symbol formula 1 or 3 3 cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a demihexeract centered at the origin are alternate halves of the hexeract with an odd number of plus signs this configuration matrix represents the 6 demicube the rows and columns correspond to vertices edges faces cells 4 faces and 5 faces the diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 6 demicube the nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column s element occur in or at the row s element the diagonal f vector numbers are derived through the wythoff construction dividing the full group order of a subgroup order by removing one mirror at a time there are 47 uniform polytopes with d symmetry 31 are shared by the b symmetry and 16 are unique the

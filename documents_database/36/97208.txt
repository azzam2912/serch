spherocytes are found in all hemolytic anemias to some degree hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are characterized by having only spherocytes spherocytes are found in immunologically mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis but the former would have a positive direct coombs test and the latter would not the misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply auto hemolysis a complete blood count cbc may show increased reticulocytes a sign of increased red blood cell production and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit the term non hereditary spherocytosis is occasionally used albeit rarely lists of causes spherocytosis most often refers to hereditary spherocytosis this is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton including spectrin ankyrin band 3 or protein 4 2 because the cell skeleton has a defect the blood cell contracts to a sphere which is its most surface tension efficient and least flexible configuration though the spherocytes have a smaller surface area through which oxygen and carbon dioxide can

the original discovery of levan began through research interests in a traditional japanese dish known as natto natto was known to be a sort of superfood which promoted health and longevity in japan during the late 1800s in 1881 lippmann first discovered l vulan levan as the remaining gum from molasses produced in the sugar beet companies later on in 1901 greig smith coined the name levan based on the levorotatory properties of this substance in polarized light this polymer is made up of fructose a monosaccharide sugar connected in 2 6 beta glycosidic linkages levan can be in both branched and linear structures of relatively low molecular weight in the branched version levan forms a very small sphere like structure this structure has basal chains of 9 units long which contain 2 1 branching allowing for the methyl ethers to form and create a spherical shape the ends of levan also tend to contain a glucosyl residue the branched structure of levan tends to be more stable than the linear structure however the amount of branching and length of polymerization tends to vary among different species the shortest levan is 6 kestose essentially a chain of two fructose molecules

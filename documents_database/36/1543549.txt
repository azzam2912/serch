systematic nomenclature identifies mass market lamps as to overall shape power rating length color and other electrical and illuminating characteristics lamps are typically identified by a code such as fxxty where f is for fluorescent the first number xx indicates either the power in watts or length in inches the t indicates that the shape of the bulb is tubular and the last number y is the diameter in eighths of an inch sometimes in millimeters rounded up to the nearest millimeter typical diameters are t12 or t38 in or 38 mm for residential lamps with magnetic ballasts t8 or t26 1 in or 25 mm for commercial energy saving lamps with electronic ballasts and t5 or t16 in or 16 mm for very small lamps which may even operate from a battery powered device some lamps have an internal opaque reflector coverage of the reflector ranges from 120 to 310 of the lamp s circumference often a lamp is marked as a reflector lamp by adding the letter r in the model code so a f t lamp with a reflector would be coded as fr t very high output vho lamps with reflectors may be coded as vhor

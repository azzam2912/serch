in common with a typical blast wave the flow field can be approximated as a lead shock wave followed by a self similar subsonic flow field the phenomenon appears to adhere to the basic principles of the sedov solution the phenomenon is so named after the lead researchers from a joint team drawn from nasa ames research center the field artillery training center at fort sill oklahoma and instructors from the usaf air weapons school at nellis afb in response to a formal request for assistance from united states central command macdill afb tampa florida framed following events during operation anaconda instructors from the royal school of artillery s gunnery training team also assisted the effect is caused by extremely localised fluctuations in surface pressure and humidity which cause the initial shock wave to distort momentarily and refocus on itself leading to a double shock wave each of markedly reduced effect this has distinct utility in the employment of air delivered ordnance in close proximity to key urban structures as part of an ongoing influence campaign the energy of the blast is so great that the pressure and temperature of the gas outside the shock front is negligible compared to

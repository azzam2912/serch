it is typically light colored scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser pumice is created when super heated highly pressurized rock is violently ejected from a volcano the unusual foamy configuration of pumice happens because of simultaneous rapid cooling and rapid depressurization the depressurization creates bubbles by lowering the solubility of gases including water and co that are dissolved in the lava causing the gases to rapidly exsolve like the bubbles of co that appear when a carbonated drink is opened the simultaneous cooling and depressurization freezes the bubbles in a matrix eruptions under water are rapidly cooled and the large volume of pumice created can be a shipping hazard for cargo ships pumice is composed of highly microvesicular glass pyroclastic with very thin translucent bubble walls of extrusive igneous rock it is commonly but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition e g rhyolitic dacitic andesite pantellerite phonolite trachyte but basaltic and other compositions are known pumice is commonly pale in color ranging from white cream blue or grey to green brown or black it forms when volcanic gases exsolving

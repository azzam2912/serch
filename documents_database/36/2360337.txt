hpg is synthesized from the shikimic acid pathway and requires four enzymes to synthesize both and hpg are used in the vancomycin class of antibiotics tyrosine a similar amino acid differs by a methylene group ch2 between the aromatic ring and the alpha carbon hpg is synthesized from prephenate an intermediate in the shikimic acid pathway and also a precursor to tyrosine prephenate is aromatized by prephenate dehydrogenase pdh using nad as a cofactor to produce 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvate 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvate is then oxidized by 4 hydroxymandelate synthase 4hmas using oxygen to form 4 hydroxymandelate and hydrogen peroxide 4hmas is a non heme iron dependent dioxygenase the reaction mechanism of this unique oxidation was proposed by choroba et al in 2000 4 hydroxymandelate is subsequently oxidized by hydroxymandelate oxidase hmo to 4 hydroxylbenzoylformate using fmn as a cofactor finally 4 hydroxyphenylglycine transaminase hpgt transfers an ammonia moiety from a donor to 4 hydroxylbenzoylformate to form hpg several different molecules can serve as the nitrogen donor for the transamination however hubbard et al suspect tyrosine to serve as the most efficient donor by doing so the following cycle is constructed hpg is also synthesized in herpetosiphon aurantiacus using enzymes haur 1871 1887

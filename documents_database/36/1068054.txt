in oxacephems such as latamoxef the sulfur atom of the cephalosporin core is replaced with an oxygen atom latamoxef has been associated with prolonged bleeding time and several cases of coagulopathy some fatal were reported during the 1980s latamoxef is no longer available in the united states as with other cephalosporins with a methylthiotetrazole side chain latamoxef causes an antabuse reaction when mixed with alcohol additionally the methylthiotetrazole side chain inhibits carboxylation of glutamic acid this can interfere with the actions of vitamin k it has been described as a third generation cephalosporin oxa substituted third generation cephalosporin antibiotic oxacephalosporin the benzhydrol ester of 6 aminopenicillanic acid 6 apa is s chlorinated and treated with base whereupon the intermediate sulfenyl chloride fragments to 2 next displacement with propargyl alcohol in the presence of zinc chloride gives predominanntly the stereochemistry represented by diastereoisomer 3 the side chain is protected as the phenylacetylamide the triple bond is partially reduced with a 5 pd caco3 lindlar catalyst and then epoxidized with mcpba to give 4 the epoxide is opened at the least hindered end with 1 methyl 1 h tetrazole 5 thiol to put in place the future c 3 side chain and

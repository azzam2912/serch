when two electrical conductors at different voltages are close together the electric field between them causes electric charge to be stored on them this effect is parasitic capacitance all actual circuit elements such as inductors diodes and transistors have internal capacitance which can cause their behavior to depart from that of ideal circuit elements additionally there is always non zero capacitance between any two conductors this can be significant at higher frequencies with closely spaced conductors such as wires or printed circuit board traces parasitic capacitance is a significant problem in high frequency circuits and is often the factor limiting the operating frequency and bandwidth of electronic components and circuits the parasitic capacitance between the turns of an inductor or other wound component is often described as self capacitance however the term self capacitance more correctly refers to a different phenomenon the capacitance of a conductive object without reference to another object when two conductors at different potentials are close to one another they are affected by each other s electric field and store opposite electric charges like a capacitor changing the potential v between the conductors requires a current i into or out of the conductors to charge or

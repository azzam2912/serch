the infinite product is defined to be the limit of the partial products a a a as n increases without bound the product is said to converge when the limit exists and is not zero otherwise the product is said to diverge a limit of zero is treated specially in order to obtain results analogous to those for infinite sums some sources allow convergence to 0 if there are only a finite number of zero factors and the product of the non zero factors is non zero but for simplicity we will not allow that here if the product converges then the limit of the sequence a as n increases without bound must be 1 while the converse is in general not true the best known examples of infinite products are probably some of the formulae for such as the following two products respectively by vi te vi te s formula the first published infinite product in mathematics and john wallis wallis product the product of positive real numbers converges to a nonzero real number if and only if the sum converges this allows the translation of convergence criteria for infinite sums into convergence criteria for infinite products the same

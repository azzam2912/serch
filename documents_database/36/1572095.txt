technologies developed under the program were to transition to both current manned aircraft and the mq x next generation unmanned aircraft with the cancellation of the mq x program the pcas program dropped the idea of using an optionally manned a 10 and refocused the effort to allow the jtac controller to interface with smart rail electronics on a manned a 10 currently pilots forward air controllers and jtacs must focus on one target at a time and rely on voice directions and paper maps to call in air support this can take up to one hour to be arranged and have an aircraft arrive on station which allows a target to relocate or attack first pcas is to digitally link aircraft with ground controllers to share real time situational awareness identify multiple targets simultaneously jointly select the best precision guided weapons for the situation and reduce engagement time to as little as six minutes pilots and jtacs will have digital messaging capabilities networked through software programmable radio which wirelessly transmits ip packets of voice video and data by using android tablets on the ground and in an aircraft s cockpit they can both view and exchange targeting information using

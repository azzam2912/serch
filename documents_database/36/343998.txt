except for excreted molecules cells producing molecules of interest must be disrupted this page discusses various methods another method of disruption is called cell unroofing a common laboratory scale mechanical method for cell disruption uses glass ceramic or steel beads 0 1 to 2 mm in diameter mixed with a sample suspended in aqueous media first developed by tim hopkins in the late 1970s the sample and bead mix is subjected to high level agitation by stirring or shaking beads collide with the cellular sample cracking open the cell to release intercellular components unlike some other methods mechanical shear is moderate during homogenization resulting in excellent membrane or subcellular preparations the method often called beadbeating works well for all types of cellular material from spores to animal and plant tissues it is the most widely used method of yeast lysis and can yield breakage of well over 50 up to 95 it has the advantage over other mechanical cell disruption methods of being able to disrupt very small sample sizes process many samples at a time with no cross contamination concerns and does not release potentially harmful aerosols in the process in the simplest example of the method an equal

packing dimension is in some sense dual to hausdorff dimension since packing dimension is constructed by packing small open balls inside the given subset whereas hausdorff dimension is constructed by covering the given subset by such small open balls the packing dimension was introduced by c tricot jr in 1982 let x d be a metric space with a subset s x and let s 0 the s dimensional packing pre measure of s is defined to be unfortunately this is just a pre measure and not a true measure on subsets of x as can be seen by considering dense countable subsets however the pre measure leads to a bona fide measure the s dimensional packing measure of s is defined to be i e the packing measure of s is the infimum of the packing pre measures of countable covers of s having done this the packing dimension dim s of s is defined analogously to the hausdorff dimension the following example is the simplest situation where hausdorff and packing dimensions may differ fix a sequence formula 4 such that formula 5 and formula 6 define inductively a nested sequence formula 7 of compact subsets of the real

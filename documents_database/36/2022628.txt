like other paper wasps polistes bellicosus build nests by manipulating exposed fibers into paper to create cells p bellicosus often rebuild their nests at least once per colony season due to predation polistes bellicosus belongs to the subfamily polistinae which consists of only social wasps polistinae is divided into four tribes polistini epiponini mischocyttarini and ropalidiini the tribe polistini includes the genus polistes and is the only tribe of polistinae with a cosmopolitan distribution i e it is the only tribe found in many different global habitats polistes bellicosus is most closely related to p apaches based on a phylogenetic tree along with the genetic similarity the phylogeny of the larva is also explained using morphological characteristics starting at the head larvae are often dark brown the body is widest at the anterior part of the abdomen and tapers towards the posterior end the circular slender mandible is weakly chitinized from the mandible extend two or three pointed teeth polistes larval mandibles function in opening and closing the mouth for intaking food larval mandibles are both longer and narrower than the mandibles of vespa larvae secreted saliva may aid in food reception for the larvae compared to vespinae the pleural

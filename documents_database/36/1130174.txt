fgf proteins interact with a family of specific tyrosine kinase receptors a process often regulated by proteoglycans or extracellular binding protein cofactors a number of intracellular signalling cascades are known to be activated after fgf fgfr interaction including pi3k akt plc ras mapk and stat pathways fgf5 is a 268 amino acid 29 1 kda protein which also naturally occurs as a 123 amino acid isoform splice variant fgf5s fgf5 is produced in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle as well as perifollicular macrophages with maximum expression occurring in the late anagen phase of the hair cycle the receptor for fgf5 fgfr1 is largely expressed in the dermal papilla cells of the hair follicle the alternatively spliced isoform fgf5s has been identified as an antagonist of fgf5 in a number of studies the only described function of fgf5 in adults is in the regulation of the hair cycle fgf5 performs a critical role in the hair cycle where it acts as the key signalling molecule in initiating the transition from the anagen growth phase to the catagen regression phase evidence of this activity was initially gathered via targeted disruption of the homolog of the fgf5 gene in mice

in soft or green tissues this is usually a waxy cuticle over the outer epidermis in older woody tissues waterproofing chemicals are present in the secondary cell wall that limit or inhibit the flow of water vascular plants also possess an internal vascular system that distributes fluids throughout the plant some xerophytes such as cacti and other desert plants have mucilage in their tissues this is a sticky substance that holds water within the plant reducing the rate of dehydration some seeds and spores remain dormant until adequate moisture is present at which time the seed or spore begins to germinate animals maintain adequate tissue hydration by means of 1 an outer skin shell or cuticle 2 a fluid filled coelom cavity and 3 a circulatory system hydration of fat free tissues ratio of total body water to fat free body mass is stable at 0 73 in mammals in humans a significant drop in tissue hydration can lead to the medical condition of dehydration this may result from loss of water itself loss of electrolytes or a loss of blood plasma administration of hydrational fluids as part of sound dehydration management is necessary to avoid severe complications and in

in 1887 michelson and morley tried to identify the state of motion of the aether to do so they assumed galilean relativity to be satisfied by clocks and rulers that is that the length of rulers and periods of clocks are invariant under any galilean frame change under such an hypothesis the aether should have been observed by comparing measurements made in different directions and looking for an effect due to the earth s orbital speed their experiment famously produced a null result as a consequence within lorentz aether theory the galilean transformation was replaced by the lorentz transformation however in lorentz aether theory the existence of an undetectable aether is assumed and the relativity principle holds the theory was quickly replaced by special relativity which gave similar formulas without the existence of an unobservable aether all inertial frames are physically equivalent in both theories more precisely provided that no phenomenon violates the principle of relativity of motion there is no means to measure the velocity of an inertial observer with regard to a possible medium of propagation of quantum waves although all inertial frames are equivalent under classical mechanics and special relativity the set of all inertial frames is

in such a situation the decay rate of a and hence the production rate of b is approximately constant because the half life of a is very long compared to the timescales being considered the quantity of radionuclide b builds up until the number of b atoms decaying per unit time becomes equal to the number being produced per unit time the quantity of radionuclide b then reaches a constant equilibrium value assuming the initial concentration of radionuclide b is zero full equilibrium usually takes several half lives of radionuclide b to establish the quantity of radionuclide b when secular equilibrium is reached is determined by the quantity of its parent a and the half lives of the two radionuclide this can be seen from the time rate of change of the number of atoms of radionuclide b where and are the decay constants of radionuclide a and b related to their half lives t by formula 2 and n and n are the number of atoms of a and b at a given time secular equilibrium occurs when formula 3 or over long enough times comparable to the half life of radionuclide a the secular equilibrium is only approximate

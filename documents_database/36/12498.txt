it is a colorless odorless and syrupy liquid that is soluble in water and is synthesized in reactions that are highly exothermic its corrosiveness can be mainly ascribed to its strong acidic nature and if at a high concentration its dehydrating and oxidizing properties it is also hygroscopic readily absorbing water vapor from the air upon contact sulfuric acid can cause severe chemical burns and even secondary thermal burns it is very dangerous even at moderate concentrations sulfuric acid is a very important commodity chemical and a nation s sulfuric acid production is a good indicator of its industrial strength it is widely produced with different methods such as contact process wet sulfuric acid process lead chamber process and some other methods sulfuric acid is also a key substance in the chemical industry it is most commonly used in fertilizer manufacture but is also important in mineral processing oil refining wastewater processing and chemical synthesis it has a wide range of end applications including in domestic acidic drain cleaners as an electrolyte in lead acid batteries in dehydrating a compound and in various cleaning agents although nearly 100 sulfuric acid can be made the subsequent loss of at the boiling

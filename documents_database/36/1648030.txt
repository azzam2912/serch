such a power plant has considerably less storage than the reservoirs of large dams and conventional hydroelectric stations which can store water for long periods such as a dry season or year with pondage water is usually stored during periods of low electricity demand and hours when the power plant is inactive enabling its use as a peaking power plant in dry seasons and a base load power plant during wet seasons ample pondage allows a power plant meet hourly load fluctuations for a period of a week or more as a daily hydropeaking cycle of a hydro power plant with pondage results in fast rising river levels downstream environmental regulations often restrict the full use of the dispatchability as a peaker because of the possibility of limited pondage calculating its effect on power generation is important in determining how often the plant can be operated the pondage factor is a rough index of the amount pondage needed when the stream flow is constant and the plant is operational during specific periods it is calculated by the ratio of total inflow hours per week to the hours the power plant will be operated in that same period for example if

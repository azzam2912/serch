the lebesgue integral extends the integral to a larger class of functions it also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined long before the 20th century mathematicians already understood that for non negative functions with a smooth enough graph such as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals the area under the curve could be defined as the integral and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons however as the need to consider more irregular functions arose e g as a result of the limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral also one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line the lebesgue integral provides abstractions needed to do this important job the lebesgue integral plays an important role in probability theory real analysis and many other fields in the mathematical sciences it is named after henri lebesgue 1875 1941 who introduced the integral it is also a pivotal part of the axiomatic theory of probability the term lebesgue integration can mean either the general theory of integration of a function with respect

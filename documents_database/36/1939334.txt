these models which provide 3d coordinates for each atom in the molecule see example in the image come from structural biology experiments such as x ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the validation has three aspects 1 checking on the validity of the thousands to millions of measurements in the experiment 2 checking how consistent the atomic model is with those experimental data and 3 checking consistency of the model with known physical and chemical properties proteins and nucleic acids are the workhorses of biology providing the necessary chemical reactions structural organization growth mobility reproduction and environmental sensitivity essential to their biological functions are the detailed 3d structures of the molecules and the changes in those structures to understand and control those functions we need accurate knowledge about the models that represent those structures including their many strong points and their occasional weaknesses end users of macromolecular models include clinicians teachers and students as well as the structural biologists themselves journal editors and referees experimentalists studying the macromolecules by other techniques and theoreticians and bioinformaticians studying more general properties of biological molecules their interests and requirements vary but all benefit greatly from a global and local understanding of the

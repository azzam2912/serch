this approach alleviates the burden of obtaining hand labeled data sets which can be costly or impractical instead inexpensive weak labels are employed with the understanding that they are imperfect but can nonetheless be used to create a strong predictive model machine learning models and techniques are increasingly accessible to researchers and developers the real world usefulness of these models however depends on access to high quality labeled training data this need for labeled training data often proves to be a significant obstacle to the application of machine learning models within an organization or industry this bottleneck effect manifests itself in various ways including the following examples insufficient quantity of labeled data when machine learning techniques are initially used in new applications or industries there is often not enough training data available to apply traditional processes some industries have the benefit of decades worth of training data readily available those that do not are at a significant disadvantage in such cases obtaining training data may be impractical expensive or impossible without waiting years for its accumulation insufficient subject matter expertise to label data when labeling training data requires specific relevant expertise creation of a usable training data set can quickly

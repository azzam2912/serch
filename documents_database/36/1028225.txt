it was previously known as pipistrellus nanus but genetic analysis has since shown it to be more closely related to other species in the genus neoromicia banana pipistrelles are unusually small bats with a total length of about about half of which consists of the tail adults weigh only although females are slightly larger than males the fur is dark with golden or reddish brown tips fading to greyish or near white tips on the fur of the underparts the wings are brown sometimes with a narrow white border on the hind margin the ears are triangular with a tragus that has been described as hatchet shaped the thumbs of banana pipistrelles bear an unusual pad composed of ridged hairy skin with multiple sebaceous glands the surface of the pads overlies a patch of connective tissue and a small piece of cartilage that connects to the end of a muscle the attachment of this muscle to the pads enables to bat to form them into a cup shape although it is unclear whether this can form an effective suction cup rather than simply improving the bat s grip onto objects through friction alone most though not all individuals also possess

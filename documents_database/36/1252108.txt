the number of known plastid genome sequences grew rapidly in the first decade of the twenty first century for example 25 chloroplast genomes were sequenced for one molecular phylogenetic study the flowering plants are especially well represented in complete chloroplast genomes as of january 2017 all of their orders are represented except commelinales picramniales huerteales escalloniales bruniales and paracryphiales a compilation of all available complete plastid genomes is maintained by the ncbi in a public repository this sortable table is expected to compile complete plastid genomes representing the largest range of sizes number of genes and angiosperm families meta algae are organisms with photosynthetic organelles of secondary or tertiary endosymbiotic origin and their close non photosynthetic plastid bearing relatives apicomplexans are a secondarily non photosynthetic group of chromalveoates which retain a reduced plastid organelle dinoflagellate plastid genomes are not organised into a single circular dna molecule like other plastid genomes but into an array of mini circles in some photosynthetic organisms that ability was acquired via symbiosis with a unicellular green alga chlorophyte or red alga rhodophyte in some such cases not only does the chloroplast of the former unicellular alga retain its own genome but a remnant of the

it is about 200 000 light years away towards the constellation of tucana the spectral type of hv 11423 is variable from k0 1i in december 2004 to m4i in december 2005 and back to k0 1i by september 2006 very large telescope file spectra show that in december 2001 the star was even cooler m4 5i by contrast in october 1978 and a year later it appeared as a star of class m0i the spectral type m4 5 is the latest observed in a supergiant of the small magellanic cloud hv 11423 is one of largest known stars with an estimated radius over 1 000 times larger than the sun it is also a variable star with a variation of up 2 magnitudes at visual wavelengths but essentially constant in the infrared it is listed in the general catalogue of variable stars as a slow irregular variable but a period of 720 days has been calculated as well as a long secondary period of 1 817 days the bolometric luminosity is over 300 000 times more than sun making it one of most luminous cool supergiants and appears to have remained unchanged during the brightness and spectral variations it

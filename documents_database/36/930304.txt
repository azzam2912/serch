it is a product developed by genmab in utrecht the netherlands specifically zalutumumab is designed for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck scchn a type of cancer zalutumumab works through inhibition of the egfr signal the egfr is a receptor tyrosine kinase its structure includes an extracellular binding domain a transmembrane lipophilic segment and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain egfr is over expressed by many tumor cells upon binding by a ligand such as the epidermal growth factor or tgf alpha dimerization occurs leading to autophosphorylation on the intracellular tyrosine residues following phosphorylation the grb2 sos signaling complex is stimulated this causes the activation of the g protein ras through the exchange of guanosine diphosphate gdp for guanosine triphosphate gtp the exchange of gdp for gtp induces a conformational change of ras to allow it to bind to raf 1 raf 1 is then activated through another multistep mechanism in which dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by protein phosphatase 2a pp2a as well as the phosphorylation of activating sites by p21 activated kinase pak occurs after this raf 1 activates mapk erk kinase mek which then goes on to activate extracellular signal regulated kinase erk erk

given an element d the set of representations of q with dim v d i for each i has a vector space structure it is naturally endowed with an action of the algebraic group gl d i by simultaneous base change such action induces one on the ring of functions the ones which are invariants up to a character of the group are called semi invariants they form a ring whose structure reflects representation theoretical properties of the quiver let q q q s t be a quiver consider a dimension vector d that is an element in the set of d dimensional representations is given by once fixed bases for each vector space v this can be identified with the vector space such affine variety is endowed with an action of the algebraic group gl d gl d i by simultaneous base change on each vertex by definition two modules m n rep q d are isomorphic if and only if their gl d orbits coincide we have an induces action on the coordinate ring k rep q d by defining an element f k rep q d is called an invariant with respect to gl d if g

a unicode code point from the basic multilingual plane bmp i e a code point in the range u 0000 to u ffff is encoded in the same way as in utf 8 a unicode supplementary character i e a code point in the range u 10000 to u 10ffff is first represented as a surrogate pair like in utf 16 and then each surrogate code point is encoded in utf 8 therefore cesu 8 needs six bytes 3 bytes per surrogate for each unicode supplementary character while utf 8 needs only four the encoding of unicode supplementary characters works out to codice 1 yyyy represents the top five bits of the character minus one cesu 8 is not an official part of the unicode standard because unicode technical reports are informative documents only it should be used exclusively for internal processing and never for external data exchange supporting cesu 8 in html documents is prohibited by the w3c and whatwg html standards as it would present a cross site scripting vulnerability cesu 8 is similar to java s modified utf 8 but does not have the special encoding of the nul character u 0000 the oracle database uses cesu

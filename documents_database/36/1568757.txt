it was first described by aublet in french guiana in 1775 and is one of six species of simarouba the tree is evergreen but produces a new set of leaves once a year it requires relatively high levels of light to grow and grows rapidly in these conditions but lives for a relatively short time in panama it flowers during the dry season in february and march whereas in costa rica where there is no dry season it flowers later between march and july as the species is dioecious the trees are either male or female and only produce male or female flowers the small yellow flowers are thought to be pollinated by insects the resulting fruits are dispersed by animals including monkeys birds and fruit eating bats and the seeds are also dispersed by leaf cutter ants simarouba amara has been studied extensively by scientists in an attempt to understand the tree and also to gain a better understanding of the ecology of the rainforest in general many of these studies were conducted on barro colorado island in panama or at la selva biological station in costa rica of particular interest is how it competes with other species and

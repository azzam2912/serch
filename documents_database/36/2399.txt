that is if and are functions then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composition the function which maps to formula 1 in terms of the derivatives of and and the product of functions as follows alternatively by letting equiv for all one can also write the chain rule in lagrange s notation as follows the chain rule may also be rewritten in leibniz s notation in the following way if a variable depends on the variable which itself depends on the variable i e and are dependent variables then via the intermediate variable of depends on as well in which case the chain rule states that the two versions of the chain rule are related in the sense that if formula 5 and formula 6 then in integration the counterpart to the chain rule is the substitution rule the chain rule seems to have first been used by gottfried wilhelm leibniz he used it to calculate the derivative of formula 8 as the composite of the square root function and the function formula 9 he first mentioned it in a 1676 memoir with a sign error in the calculation the common notation of chain rule is due to

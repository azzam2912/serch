matching preclusion measures the robustness of a graph as a communications network topology for distributed algorithms that require each node of the distributed system to be matched with a neighboring partner node in many graphs mp g is equal to the minimum degree of any vertex in the graph because deleting all edges incident to a single vertex prevents it from being matched this set of edges is called a trivial matching preclusion set a variant definition the conditional matching preclusion number asks for the minimum number of edges the deletion of which results in a graph that has neither a perfect or near perfect matching nor any isolated vertices it is np complete to test whether the matching preclusion number of a given graph is below a given threshold the strong matching preclusion number or simply smp number is a generalization of the matching preclusion number the smp number of a graph g smp g is the minimum number of vertices and or edges whose deletion results in a graph that has neither perfect matchings nor almost perfect matchings other numbers defined in a similar way by edge deletion in an undirected graph include the edge connectivity the minimum

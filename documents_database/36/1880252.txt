a vector is an exterior normal at a point of the closed set if there is a real valued continuously differentiable function maximized locally at the point with that vector as its derivative at the point if the closed subset is a smooth submanifold with boundary the condition states that the vector field should not point outside the subset at boundary points the generalization to non smooth subsets is important in the theory of partial differential equations the theorem had in fact been previously discovered by mitio nagumo in 1942 and is also known as the nagumo theorem let f be closed subset of a c manifold m and let x be a vector field on m which is lipschitz continuous the following conditions are equivalent following to prove that the first condition implies the second let c t be an integral curve with c 0 x in f and dc dt x c let g have a local maximum on f at x then g c t g c 0 for t small and positive differentiating this implies that g x x x 0 to prove the reverse implication since the result is local it enough to check it

as a result their outgassing can be unpredictable the reason this happens is thought to be similar to how mud cracks at the bottom of a dry lake bed leaving small chunks loose on the surface of the body which later get pushed off it due to radiation pressure sweeping sometimes an object can be mistakenly identified as a rock comet such as p 2010 a2 an asteroid in the asteroid belt that collided with another object causing it to have a field of debris trailing it for a short time rock comets are rare because a rocky small solar system body must come very close to the sun close enough for both the solid ground to crack and for radiation pressure sufficient to push the separate pieces off the asteroid however if the asteroid is close enough to the sun for the former the latter will also happen until 2016 the only known example of a rock comet was 3200 phaethon which has a perihelion closest point to the sun closer than any other named asteroid 0 14 au it has been known to brighten on occasions implying outgassing and has been observed ejecting dust by the stereo spacecraft

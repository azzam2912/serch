tangent vectors are described in the differential geometry of curves in the context of curves in r more generally tangent vectors are elements of a tangent space of a differentiable manifold tangent vectors can also be described in terms of germs formally a tangent vector at the point formula 1 is a linear derivation of the algebra defined by the set of germs at formula 1 before proceeding to a general definition of the tangent vector we discuss its use in calculus and its tensor properties let formula 3 be a parametric smooth curve the tangent vector is given by formula 4 where we have used the a prime instead of the usual dot to indicate differentiation with respect to parameter t the unit tangent vector is given by given the curve in formula 7 the unit tangent vector at formula 8 is given by if formula 3 is given parametrically in the n dimensional coordinate system x here we have used superscripts as an index instead of the usual subscript by formula 11 or then the tangent vector field formula 13 is given by under a change of coordinates the tangent vector formula 16 in the u coordinate system

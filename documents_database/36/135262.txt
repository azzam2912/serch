in most of the cases this activity concerns processing human language texts by means of natural language processing nlp recent activities in multimedia document processing like automatic annotation and content extraction out of images audio video documents could be seen as information extraction due to the difficulty of the problem current approaches to ie focus on narrowly restricted domains an example is the extraction from newswire reports of corporate mergers such as denoted by the formal relation from an online news sentence such as a broad goal of ie is to allow computation to be done on the previously unstructured data a more specific goal is to allow logical reasoning to draw inferences based on the logical content of the input data structured data is semantically well defined data from a chosen target domain interpreted with respect to category and context information extraction is the part of a greater puzzle which deals with the problem of devising automatic methods for text management beyond its transmission storage and display the discipline of information retrieval ir has developed automatic methods typically of a statistical flavor for indexing large document collections and classifying documents another complementary approach is that of natural language processing

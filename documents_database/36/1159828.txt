the long duration exposure facility ldef which was retrieved in 1990 after spending 68 months in leo revealed that space environments are very hostile to many spacecraft materials and components atomic oxygen which is the most prevalent atomic species encountered in low earth orbit is highly reactive with plastics and some metals causing severe erosion there is also extreme ultraviolet radiation due to the lack of an atmospheric filter this radiation deteriorates and darkens many plastics and coatings the vacuum in space also alters the physical properties of many materials impacts of meteoroids and orbiting man made debris can damage all materials exposed in space the combined effects of all of these environments on spacecraft can only be investigated in space misse evaluates materials currently being used and those planned for use in future space missions the misse program is a direct successor to the mir environmental effects payloads meeps that were attached for over a year to the mir docking module of the space station mir between shuttle flights sts 76 and sts 86 and is a descendant of the long duration exposure facility also meeps can trace their inception to the passive optical sample array posa sample trays

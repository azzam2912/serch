it causes lysis of mammalian and bacterial cells similar to melittin in the lab pardaxin is synthesized using an automated peptide synthesizer alternatively the secretions of the red sea sole can be collected and purified pardaxin has a helix hinge helix structure this structure is common in peptides that act selectively on bacterial membranes and cytotoxic peptides that lyse mammalian and bacterial cells pardaxin shows a significantly lower hemolytic activity towards human red blood cells compared to melittin the c terminal tail of pardaxin is responsible for this non selective activity against the erythrocytes and bacteria the amphiphilic c terminal helix is the ion channel lining segment of the peptide the n terminal helix is important for the insertion of the peptide to the lipid bilayer of the cell the mechanism of pardaxin is dependent on the membrane composition pardaxin significantly disrupts lipid bilayers composed of zwitterionic lipids especially those composed of 1 palmitoyl 2 oleoyl phosphatidylcholine popc this suggests a carpet mechanism for cell lysis the carpet mechanism is when a high density of peptides accumulates on the target membrane surface the phospholipid displacement changes in fluidity and the cellular contents leak out the presence of anionic lipids or

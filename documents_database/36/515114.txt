more generally a hilbert modular variety is an algebraic variety obtained by taking a quotient of a product of multiple copies of the upper half plane by a hilbert modular group hilbert modular surfaces were first described by using some unpublished notes written by david hilbert about 10 years before if r is the ring of integers of a real quadratic field then the hilbert modular group sl r acts on the product h h of two copies of the upper half plane h there are several birationally equivalent surfaces related to this action any of which may be called hilbert modular surfaces there are several variations of this construction showed how to resolve the quotient singularities and showed how to resolve their cusp singularities the papers and identified their type in the classification of algebraic surfaces most of them are surfaces of general type but several are rational surfaces or blown up k3 surfaces or elliptic surfaces gives a long table of examples the clebsch surface blown up at its 10 eckardt points is a hilbert modular surface

in the bloodiest battle recorded in ancient greek history the phocians were decisively defeated by philip s forces philip s victory secured his appointment as ruler of thessaly marking an important step in the rise of macedon to political ascendancy in ancient greece opinion amongst historians is divided as to the year of the battle some favour 353 bc and others 352 bc the ancient sources for the third sacred war are scant and generally lacking in firm chronological information the main source for the period is diodorus siculus s bibliotheca historica written in the 1st century bc which is therefore very much a secondary source diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else diodorus worked primarily by epitomizing the works of other historians omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose which was to illustrate moral lessons from history his account of the third sacred war therefore contains many gaps beyond diodorus further details of the sacred war can be found in the orations of athenian statesmen primarily demosthenes and aeschines which have survived intact since these speeches were never intended

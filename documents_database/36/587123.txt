2 3 3 1 previously 4 1 3 7 exists in nearly all living cells and stands as a pace making enzyme in the first step of the citric acid cycle or krebs cycle citrate synthase is localized within eukaryotic cells in the mitochondrial matrix but is encoded by nuclear dna rather than mitochondrial it is synthesized using cytoplasmic ribosomes then transported into the mitochondrial matrix citrate synthase is commonly used as a quantitative enzyme marker for the presence of intact mitochondria maximal activity of citrate synthase indicates the mitochondrial content of skeletal muscle the maximal activity can be increased by endurance training or high intensity interval training but maximal activity is increased more with high intensity interval training citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction of the two carbon acetate residue from acetyl coenzyme a and a molecule of four carbon oxaloacetate to form the six carbon citrate oxaloacetate is regenerated after the completion of one round of the krebs cycle oxaloacetate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme this induces the enzyme to change its conformation and creates a binding site for the acetyl coa only when this citroyl coa has formed will another conformational change cause

coffman jr and ronald graham for arranging the elements of a partially ordered set into a sequence of levels the algorithm chooses an arrangement such that an element that comes after another in the order is assigned to a lower level and such that each level has a number of elements that does not exceed a fixed width bound when it uses the minimum possible number of distinct levels and in general it uses at most times as many levels as necessary in the version of the job shop scheduling problem solved by the coffman graham algorithm one is given a set of jobs together with a system of precedence constraints requiring that job be completed before job begins each job is assumed to take unit time to complete the scheduling task is to assign each of these jobs to time slots on a system of identical processors minimizing the makespan of the assignment the time from the beginning of the first job until the completion of the final job abstractly the precedence constraints define a partial order on the jobs so the problem can be rephrased as one of assigning the elements of this partial order to levels time

this concept was introduced by lance williams in 1978 in a paper entitled casting curved shadows on curved surfaces since then it has been used both in pre rendered and realtime scenes in many console and pc games shadows are created by testing whether a pixel is visible from the light source by comparing the pixel to a z buffer or depth image of the light source s view stored in the form of a texture if you looked out from a source of light all of the objects you can see would appear in light anything behind those objects however would be in shadow this is the basic principle used to create a shadow map the light s view is rendered storing the depth of every surface it sees the shadow map next the regular scene is rendered comparing the depth of every point drawn as if it were being seen by the light rather than the eye to this depth map this technique is less accurate than shadow volumes but the shadow map can be a faster alternative depending on how much fill time is required for either technique in a particular application and therefore may be more

a familiar example of a rare event in this context would be nucleation of a raindrop from over saturated water vapour although raindrops form every day relative to the length and time scales defined by the motion of water molecules in the vapour phase the formation of a liquid droplet is extremely rare due to the wide use of computer simulation across very different fields of endeavour articles on the topic arise from quite disparate sources and it is difficult to make a coherent survey of rare event sampling techniques contemporary methods include transition path sampling tps replica exchange transition interface sampling retis repetitive simulation trials after reaching thresholds restart forward flux sampling ffs generalized splitting adaptive multilevel splitting ams stochastic process rare event sampling spres line sampling and subset simulation the first published rare event technique was by herman kahn and theodore edward harris in 1951 who in turn referred to an unpublished technical report by john von neumann and stanislaw ulam to generate simulation trajectories it is typically necessary to find some way of altering an existing configuration or trajectory so as to explore new regions of the configurational space a common theme in restart ffs ams and

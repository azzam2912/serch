there are two main applications for rain sensors the first is a water conservation device connected to an automatic irrigation system that causes the system to shut down in the event of rainfall the second is a device used to protect the interior of an automobile from rain and to support the automatic mode of windscreen wipers an additional application in professional satellite communications antennas is to trigger a rain blower on the aperture of the antenna feed to remove water droplets from the mylar cover that keeps pressurized and dry air inside the wave guides rain sensors for irrigation systems are available in both wireless and hard wired versions most employing hygroscopic disks that swell in the presence of rain and shrink back down again as they dry out an electrical switch is in turn depressed or released by the hygroscopic disk stack and the rate of drying is typically adjusted by controlling the ventilation reaching the stack however some electrical type sensors are also marketed that use tipping bucket or conductance type probes to measure rainfall wireless and wired versions both use similar mechanisms to temporarily suspend watering by the irrigation controller specifically they are connected to the

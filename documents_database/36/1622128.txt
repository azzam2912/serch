the scale and associated measurement technique were proposed by the english potter josiah wedgwood in the 18th century the measurement was based on the shrinking of clay when heated above red heat and the shrinking was evaluated by comparing heated and unheated clay cylinders the scale started at being 0 wedgwood and had 240 steps of both the origin and the step were later found inaccurate the boiling point of mercury limits the mercury in glass thermometer to temperatures below 356 c which is too low for many industrial applications such as pottery glass making and metallurgy to solve this problem the english potter josiah wedgwood proposed in the 18th century a method to measure temperatures in his kilns his method and temperature scale were then widely adopted in science and technical applications they were abandoned after the invention of accurate types of pyrometer for example the pyrometer of john frederic daniell in 1830 a 0 5 inch diameter cylinder made from pipe clay was dried at the temperature of boiling water this would prepare it for heating in the oven in which the temperature was to be measured during the annealing sintering merging of fine particles resulted in contraction

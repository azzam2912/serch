its formation is common during the winter in rivers and lakes located in northern latitudes and usually forms in open water reaches of rivers where and when the heat exchange between the air and the water is such that the water temperature can drop below its freezing point typically not lower than 0 1 c in rivers as a rule of thumb such conditions may happen on cold and clear nights when the air temperature is lower than frazil ice also forms in oceans where it is often referred to as grease ice when floating on the surface frazil ice is notorious for blocking water intakes as crystals accumulate and build up on the intake trash rack such blockages negatively impact water supply facilities hydropower plants nuclear power facilities and vessels navigating in cold waters and can lead to unexpected shut downs of the facility or even collapse of the trash rack when the water surface begins to lose heat rapidly the water becomes supercooled turbulence caused by strong winds or flow from a river will mix the supercooled water throughout its entire depth the supercooled water will already be encouraging the formation of small ice crystals frazil ice and

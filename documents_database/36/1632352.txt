the engine is hot and hence the terminology hot start when a reciprocating fuel injected engine is shut down the residual engine heat dissipates into the air and the surrounding aircraft structure some of this heat is transferred to the engine fuel lines and fuel injector lines in the engine compartment and because no fuel is flowing in the lines to cool them as would be under normal operating conditions the fuel may vaporize or boil within these fuel lines creating a condition called vapor lock this combination of liquid fuel and vaporized fuel within the fuel line will result in inconsistent fuel availability to the engine fuel pump and fuel injection system if severe the fuel pumps can cavitate when the pumping chamber fills with fuel vapor rather than liquid fuel and become ineffective the vapor in the fuel lines and loss of fuel pump effectiveness result in inconsistent fuel flow to the engine fuel injectors and ultimately the cylinders resulting difficult starting vapor lock can also occur in flight in some aircraft resulting in a rough running engine or engine stoppage unlike a turbine engine a hot start is unlikely to damage a reciprocating fuel injected engine however

its primary use is with dynamic software analysis to help answer the question how much testing is enough dynamic software analysis is used to measure the quality and efficacy of software test data where the quantification is performed in terms of structural units of the code under test when used to quantify the structural units exercised by a given set of test data dynamic analysis is also referred to as structural coverage analysis in a narrower sense an lcsaj is a well defined linear region of a program s code when used in this sense lcsaj is also called jj path standing for jump to jump path the lcsaj analysis method was devised by professor michael hennell in order to perform quality assessments on the mathematical libraries on which his nuclear physics research at the university of liverpool depended professor hennell later founded the liverpool data research associates ldra company to commercialize the software test bed produced for this work resulting in the ldra testbed product introduced in 1976 the lcsaj is now also referred to as the jump to jump path jj path it has also been called liverpool s contribution to silly acronyms and jokes an lcsaj is

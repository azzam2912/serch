virtual addresses are used by the program executed by the accessing process while physical addresses are used by the hardware or more specifically by the ram subsystem the page table is a key component of virtual address translation which is necessary to access data in memory in operating systems that use virtual memory every process is given the impression that it is working with large contiguous sections of memory physically the memory of each process may be dispersed across different areas of physical memory or may have been moved paged out to another storage typically to a hard disk drive when a process requests access to data in its memory it is the responsibility of the operating system to map the virtual address provided by the process to the physical address of the actual memory where that data is stored the page table is where the operating system stores its mappings of virtual addresses to physical addresses with each mapping also known as a page table entry pte the cpu s memory management unit mmu stores a cache of recently used mappings from the operating system s page table this is called the translation lookaside buffer tlb which is an

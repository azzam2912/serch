if the additional dimensions are compact then the observed universe contains the extra dimension and then no reference to the bulk is appropriate in the bulk model at least some of the extra dimensions are extensive possibly infinite and other branes may be moving through this bulk interactions with the bulk and possibly with other branes can influence our brane and thus introduce effects not seen in more standard cosmological models some versions of brane cosmology based on the large extra dimension idea can explain the weakness of gravity relative to the other fundamental forces of nature thus solving the hierarchy problem in the brane picture the electromagnetic weak and strong nuclear force are localized on the brane but gravity has no such constraint and propagates on the full spacetime called bulk much of the gravitational attractive power leaks into the bulk as a consequence the force of gravity should appear significantly stronger on small subatomic or at least sub millimetre scales where less gravitational force has leaked various experiments are currently under way to test this extensions of the large extra dimension idea with supersymmetry in the bulk appears to be promising in addressing the so called cosmological constant

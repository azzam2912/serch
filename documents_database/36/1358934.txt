the term was first used by caron et al in 2001 characteristics of ridges are clustering of genes in prokaryotes was known for a long time their genes are grouped in operons genes within operons share a common promoter unit these genes are mostly functionally related the genome of prokaryotes is relatively very simple and compact in eukaryotes the genome is huge and only a small amount of it are functionally genes furthermore the genes are not arranged in operons except for nematodes and trypanosomes although their operons are different from the prokaryotic operons in eukaryotes each gene has a transcription regulation site of its own therefore genes don t have to be in close proximity to be co expressed therefore it was long assumed that eukaryotic genes were randomly distributed across the genome due to the high rate of chromosome rearrangements but because the complete sequence of genomes became available it became possible to absolutely locate a gene and measure its distance to other genes the first eukaryote genome ever sequenced was that of saccharomyces cerevisiae or budding yeast in 1996 half a year after that velculescu et al 1997 published a research in which they had integrated sage

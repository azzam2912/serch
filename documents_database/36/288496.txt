the blue color of the rock comes from the presence of the predominant minerals glaucophane and lawsonite blueschists are typically found within orogenic belts as terranes of lithology in faulted contact with greenschist or rarely eclogite facies rocks blueschist as a rock type is defined by the presence of the minerals glaucophane lawsonite or epidote jadeite albite or chlorite garnet muscovite in a rock of roughly basaltic composition blueschist often has a lepidoblastic nematoblastic or schistose rock microstructure defined primarily by chlorite phengitic white mica glaucophane and other minerals with an elongate or platy shape grain size is rarely coarse as mineral growth is retarded by the swiftness of the rock s metamorphic trajectory and perhaps more importantly the low temperatures of metamorphism and in many cases the anhydrous state of the basalts however porphyritic varieties do occur blueschists may appear blue black gray or blue green in outcrop blueschist facies is determined by the particular temperature and pressure conditions required to metamorphose basalt to form blueschist felsic rocks and pelitic sediments which are subjected to blueschist facies conditions will form different mineral assemblages than metamorphosed basalt thereby these rocks do not appear blue overall in color blueschist mineralogy varies

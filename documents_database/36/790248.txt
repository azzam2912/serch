each 5 polytope ridge being shared by exactly two 6 polytope facets a uniform 7 polytope is one whose symmetry group is transitive on vertices and whose facets are uniform 6 polytopes regular 7 polytopes are represented by the schl fli symbol p q r s t u with u p q r s t 6 polytopes facets around each 4 face there are exactly three such convex regular 7 polytopes there are no nonconvex regular 7 polytopes the topology of any given 7 polytope is defined by its betti numbers and torsion coefficients the value of the euler characteristic used to characterise polyhedra does not generalize usefully to higher dimensions whatever their underlying topology this inadequacy of the euler characteristic to reliably distinguish between different topologies in higher dimensions led to the discovery of the more sophisticated betti numbers similarly the notion of orientability of a polyhedron is insufficient to characterise the surface twistings of toroidal polytopes and this led to the use of torsion coefficients uniform 7 polytopes with reflective symmetry can be generated by these four coxeter groups represented by permutations of rings of the coxeter dynkin diagrams the a family has symmetry of order 40320 8

the quantum states are probed through the nuclear magnetic resonances allowing the system to be implemented as a variation of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr differs from other implementations of quantum computers in that it uses an ensemble of systems in this case molecules rather than a single pure state initially the approach was to use the spin properties of atoms of particular molecules in a liquid sample as qubits this is known as liquid state nmr lsnmr this approach has since been superseded by solid state nmr ssnmr as a means of quantum computation the ideal picture of liquid state nmr lsnmr quantum information processing qip is based on a molecule in which some of its atom s nuclei behave as spin systems depending on which nuclei we are considering they will have different energy levels and different interaction with its neighbours and so we can treat them as distinguishable qubits in this system we tend to consider the inter atomic bonds as the source of interactions between qubits and exploit these spin spin interactions to perform 2 qubit gates such as cnots that are necessary for universal quantum computation in addition to the spin spin interactions native to

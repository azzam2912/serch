for example some variation in the definition of locally compact arises from different senses of the term locally given some notion of equivalence e g homeomorphism diffeomorphism isometry between topological spaces two spaces are locally equivalent if every point of the first space has a neighborhood which is equivalent to a neighborhood of the second space for instance the circle and the line are very different objects one cannot stretch the circle to look like the line nor compress the line to fit on the circle without gaps or overlaps however a small piece of the circle can be stretched and flattened out to look like a small piece of the line for this reason one may say that the circle and the line are locally equivalent similarly the sphere and the plane are locally equivalent a small enough observer standing on the surface of a sphere e g a person and the earth would find it indistinguishable from a plane for an infinite group a small neighborhood is taken to be a finitely generated subgroup an infinite group is said to be locally p if every finitely generated subgroup is p for instance a group is locally finite if

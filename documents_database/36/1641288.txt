microbes as seen during class switching a major component of the process of affinity maturation shm diversifies b cell receptors used to recognize foreign elements antigens and allows the immune system to adapt its response to new threats during the lifetime of an organism somatic hypermutation involves a programmed process of mutation affecting the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes unlike germline mutation shm affects only an organism s individual immune cells and the mutations are not transmitted to the organism s offspring mistargeted somatic hypermutation is a likely mechanism in the development of b cell lymphomas and many other cancers when a b cell recognizes an antigen it is stimulated to divide or proliferate during proliferation the b cell receptor locus undergoes an extremely high rate of somatic mutation that is at least 10 10 fold greater than the normal rate of mutation across the genome variation is mainly in the form of single base substitutions with insertions and deletions being less common these mutations occur mostly at hotspots in the dna which are concentrated in hypervariable regions these regions correspond to the complementarity determining regions the sites involved in antigen recognition on the immunoglobulin the hotspots of somatic hypermutation

the controllers are distinct from the switches this separation of the control from the forwarding allows for more sophisticated traffic management than is feasible using access control lists acls and routing protocols also openflow allows switches from different vendors often each with their own proprietary interfaces and scripting languages to be managed remotely using a single open protocol the protocol s inventors consider openflow an enabler of software defined networking sdn openflow allows remote administration of a layer 3 switch s packet forwarding tables by adding modifying and removing packet matching rules and actions this way routing decisions can be made periodically or ad hoc by the controller and translated into rules and actions with a configurable lifespan which are then deployed to a switch s flow table leaving the actual forwarding of matched packets to the switch at wire speed for the duration of those rules packets which are unmatched by the switch can be forwarded to the controller the controller can then decide to modify existing flow table rules on one or more switches or to deploy new rules to prevent a structural flow of traffic between switch and controller it could even decide to forward the traffic

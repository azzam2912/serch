in this case the function varies from 1 to 1 approaching 1 as formula 2 and 1 as formula 3 the function is best known for arising in the calculation of the magnetization of an ideal paramagnet in particular it describes the dependency of the magnetization formula 4 on the applied magnetic field formula 5 and the total angular momentum quantum number j of the microscopic magnetic moments of the material the magnetization is given by where note that in the si system of units formula 5 given in tesla stands for the magnetic field formula 16 where formula 17 is the auxiliary magnetic field given in a m and formula 18 is the permeability of vacuum takacs proposed the following approximation to the inverse of the brillouin function where the constants formula 20 and formula 21 are defined to be in the classical limit the moments can be continuously aligned in the field and formula 24 can assume all values formula 25 the brillouin function is then simplified into the langevin function named after paul langevin for small values of the langevin function can be approximated by a truncation of its taylor series an alternative better behaved approximation can

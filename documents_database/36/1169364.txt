it and the ions that compose it have been linked to tumor formation and gene mutation particularly to wildlife nickel ii chromate can be formed in the lab by heating a mixture of chromium iii oxide and nickel oxide at between 700 c and 800 c under 1000 atmosphere s pressure of oxygen it can be produced at 535 c and 7 3 bar oxygen but the reaction takes days to complete if the pressure is too low or temperature too high but above 660 then the nickel chromium spinel nicro forms instead karin brandt also claimed to make nickel chromate using a hydrothermal technique precipitates of ni ions with chromate produce a brown substance that contains water the structure of nickel chromate is the same as for chromium vanadate crvo crystals have an orthorhombic structure with unit cell sizes a 5 482 b 8 237 c 6 147 the cell volume is 277 6 with four formula per unit cell nickel chromate is dark in colour unlike most other chromates which are yellow the infrared spectrum of nickel chromate show two sets of absorption bands the first includes lines at 925 825 and 800 cm due to cr o

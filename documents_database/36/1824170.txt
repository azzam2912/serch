it was proved independently by max koecher in 1957 and ernest vinberg in 1961 it provides a one to one correspondence between formally real jordan algebras and so called domains of positivity thus it links operator algebraic and convex order theoretic views on state spaces of physical systems a convex cone formula 1 is called regular if formula 2 whenever both formula 3 and formula 4 are in the closure formula 5 a convex cone formula 1 in a vector space formula 7 with an inner product has a dual cone formula 8 the cone is called self dual when formula 9 it is called homogeneous when to any two points formula 10 there is a real linear transformation formula 11 that restricts to a bijection formula 12 and satisfies formula 13 the koecher vinberg theorem now states that these properties precisely characterize the positive cones of jordan algebras theorem there is a one to one correspondence between formally real jordan algebras and convex cones that are convex cones satisfying these four properties are called domains of positivity or symmetric cones the domain of positivity associated with a real jordan algebra formula 7 is the interior of the positive cone

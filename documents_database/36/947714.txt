it is a member of the stat protein family stat3 is a member of the stat protein family in response to cytokines and growth factors stat3 is phosphorylated by receptor associated janus kinases jak form homo or heterodimers and translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators specifically stat3 becomes activated after phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 in response to such ligands as interferons epidermal growth factor egf interleukin il 5 and il 6 additionally activation of stat3 may occur via phosphorylation of serine 727 by mitogen activated protein kinases mapk and through c src non receptor tyrosine kinase stat3 mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis stat3 deficient mouse embryos cannot develop beyond embryonic day 7 when gastrulation begins it appears that at these early stages of development stat3 activation is required for self renewal of embryonic stem cells escs indeed lif which is supplied to murine esc cultures to maintain their undifferentiated state can be omitted if stat3 is activated through some other means stat3 is essential for the differentiation of the th17 helper

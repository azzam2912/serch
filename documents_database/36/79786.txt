as part of the project an unmanned solar sail spacecraft christened cosmos 1 was launched into space at 15 46 09 edt 19 46 09 utc on june 21 2005 from the submarine borisoglebsk in the barents sea however a rocket failure prevented the spacecraft from reaching its intended orbit once in orbit the spacecraft was supposed to deploy a large sail upon which photons from the sun would push thereby increasing the spacecraft s velocity the contributions from the solar wind are similar but of much smaller magnitude had the mission been successful it would have been the first ever orbital use of a solar sail to speed up a spacecraft as well as the first space mission by a space advocacy group the project budget was us 4 million the planetary society planned to raise another 4 million for cosmos 2 a reimplementation of the experiment provisionally to be launched on a soyuz resupply mission to the international space station the discovery channel was an early investor however advances in technology and the greater availability of lower mass piggyback slots on more launch vehicles led to a redesign similar to nanosail d called lightsail 1 announced in november

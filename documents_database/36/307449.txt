it utilized a scheme in which fission and fusion fuel lithium 6 deuteride were layered a design known as the sloika named after a type of layered puff pastry model in the soviet union a ten fold increase in explosive power was achieved by a combination of fusion energy and neutron initiated boosted fission a similar design was earlier theorized by edward teller but never tested in the u s as the alarm clock the soviet union started studies of advanced nuclear bombs and a hydrogen bomb code named rds 6 in june 1948 the studies would be done by kb 11 usually referred to as arzamas 16 the name of the town and fian the first hydrogen bomb design was the truba pipe cylinder rds 6t in march 1948 klaus fuchs had provided the ussr with documents of the us classical super in these documents the classical super was described as consisting of a gun type uranium 235 primary with beryllium oxide tamper and a secondary consisting of a long cylinder with deuterium doped with tritium near the primary the design of the rds 6t was similar to this classical super the difference was that the light shell of

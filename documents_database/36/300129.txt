a dead end transmission tower uses horizontal strain insulators at the end of conductors dead end towers may be used at a substation as a transition to a slack span entering the equipment when the circuit changes to a buried cable when a transmission line changes direction by more than a few degrees or just once in a while to limit the extent of a catastrophic collapse since dead end towers require more material and are heavier and costlier than suspension towers it is uneconomic to build a line with only self supporting structures dead end towers are used at regular intervals in a long transmission line to limit the cascading tower failures that might occur after a conductor failure an in line dead end tower will have two sets of strain insulators supporting the lines in either direction with the lines connected by a jumper between the two segments dead end towers can resist unbalanced forces due to line weight and tension contrasted with suspension towers which mostly just support the conductor weight and have relatively low capacity for unbalanced load dead end towers may use earth anchor cables to compensate for the asymmetric attachment of the conductors they

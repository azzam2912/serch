this group of enzymes usually utilizes nadp or nad as cofactors transmembrane oxidoreductases create electron transport chains in bacteria chloroplasts and mitochondria including respiratory complexes i ii and iii some others can associate with biological membranes as peripheral membrane proteins or be anchored to the membranes through a single transmembrane helix for example an enzyme that catalyzed this reaction would be an oxidoreductase in this example a is the reductant electron donor and b is the oxidant electron acceptor in biochemical reactions the redox reactions are sometimes more difficult to see such as this reaction from glycolysis in this reaction nad is the oxidant electron acceptor and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate is the reductant electron donor proper names of oxidoreductases are formed as donor acceptor oxidoreductase however other names are much more common the common name is donor dehydrogenase when possible such as glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase for the second reaction above common names are also sometimes formed as acceptor reductase such as nad reductase donor oxidase is a special case where o is the acceptor oxidoreductases are classified as ec 1 in the ec number classification of enzymes oxidoreductases can be further classified into 22 subclasses

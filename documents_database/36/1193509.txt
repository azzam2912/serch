it is a tendon specific gene marker known to be important for tendon maturation with key implications for the residing tendon stem progenitor cells tspcs as well as for the regulation of endothelial cell migration in chordae tendineae cordis in the heart and in experimental tumour models it is highly expressed in tendons explaining the rationale behind its name and the establishment as being marker gene for tendinous and ligamentous lineages tnmd belongs to the new family of type ii transmembrane glycoproteins the gene is localized on the x chromosome and accounts for an approximately 1 4 kb transcript and a predicted protein consisting of 317 amino acids the gene is composed of seven exons the second exon encodes the transmembrane domain amino acid position 31 49 and no signal peptide tnmd contains a putative protease recognition sequence arg xxx xxx arg identified at the position 233 236 unlike chondromodulin 1 tnmd does not have a processing signal for furin protease the extracellular part prior the putative cleavage site contains a brichos extracellular domain found also in several other unrelated proteins this domain consists of a homologous sequence of approximately 100 amino acids containing a pair of conserved cysteine residues

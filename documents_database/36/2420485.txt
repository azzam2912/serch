it is correlated to marine isotope stage 16 mis 16 approximately 650 000 years ago which globally contained one of the largest glacial volumes of the quaternary the don glaciation shows evidence of the most extensive ice sheet on the east european plain extending into the drainage basin of the middle and lower don river in russia reaching 50 degrees north latitude this glaciation occurred before the muchkap interglacial and the oka and dnieper glaciations of eastern europe mis 16 is a major glacial stage identified through measurements of oxygene isotopes in deep sea core samples marine isotope stage of cromerian age approximately 676 621 ka ago in terms of global ice volume it ranks as one of the two most extreme glaciations of the quaternary on par with mis 12 however in terms of sea water temperatures it is a much more modest glaciation of similar climate intensity to the neighbouring cromerian glaciations mis 14 and mis 18 the atmospheric concentration of was below 180 ppm for 3 ka during mis 16 the lowest of the last eight glacial cycles don and mis 16 are usually correlated to each other this is based on assumption that the most widespread

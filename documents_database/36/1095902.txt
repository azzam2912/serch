there are subtypes split image telemeter inverted image or double image telemeter with different principles how two images in a single ocular are compared coincidence rangefinders were important elements of fire control systems for long range naval guns and land based coastal artillery circa 1890 1960 they were also used in rangefinder cameras the device consists of a long tube with a forward facing lense at each end and an operator eyepiece in the center two prism wedges which when aligned result in no deviation of the light are inserted into the light path of one of the two lenses by rotating the prisms in opposite directions using a differential gear a degree of horizontal displacement of the image can be achieved a stereoscopic telemeter looks similar but has two eyepieces and uses a different principle based on binocular vision optical rangefinders using this principle while applicable to several purposes were widely used for military purposes determining the range of a target and for photographic use determining the distance of a subject to photograph to allow focussing on it photographic rangefinders were initially accessories from which the distance read off could be transferred to the camera s focussing mechanism later

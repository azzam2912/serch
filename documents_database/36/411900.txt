like the aphex twin releases the work is mainly instrumental although there are samples of the sound of a choir vocalizing on tongues and a woman saying bad days in the background of bad days many of the tracks are beat driven except j breas and piano and string which both use pianos and synthesizers bad days uses a sweeping synth effect and sound is a high pitched loop playing and fading out and in 80 uses synths mimicking an acoustic guitar the album has an experimental moody style many of the tracks including bad days and lean on me are dark and unearthly there are also some more uplifting numbers like heaven tongues and dog which are more beat driven dancable numbers the track myopia uses a bubbling synth bass style house of blue leaves and my beautiful blue sky are more experimental beat songs house of blue leaves is a simple beat and some keyboards and my beautiful blue sky is a tribal rhythm synths and a piano credits for ambient adapted from album liner notes

as a branch of geology igneous petrology is closely related to volcanology tectonophysics and petrology in general the modern study of igneous rocks utilizes a number of techniques some of them developed in the fields of chemistry physics or other earth sciences petrography crystallography and isotopic studies are common methods used in igneous petrology the composition of igneous rocks and minerals can be determined via a variety of methods of varying ease cost and complexity the simplest method is observation of hand samples with the naked eye and or with a hand lens this can be used to gauge the general mineralogical composition of the rock which gives an insight into the composition a more precise but still relatively inexpensive way to identify minerals and thereby the bulk chemical composition of the rock with a petrographic microscope these microscopes have polarizing plates filters and a conoscopic lens that allow the user to measure a variety of crystallographic properties another method for determining mineralogy is to use x ray diffraction in which a powdered sample is bombarded by x rays and the resultant spectrum of crystallographic orientations is compared to a set of standards one of the most precise ways of

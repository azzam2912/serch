they are part of the insufficiently studied superfamily gelechioidea and like their relatives the circumscription of this taxon is disputed in some approaches the oecophoridae are expanded to include several lineages formerly placed in the elachistidae or considered independent gelechioid families as regards the oecophorinae the proposed concealer moth subfamilies chimabachinae deuterogoniinae peleopodinae and philobotinae were included here pending further study of the affiliations of their genera they were also often treated as independent families chimabachidae deuterogoniidae peleopodidae and philobotidae by those who followed a splitting approach in general the delimitation of the oecophorinae versus the amphisbatinae depressariinae and hypertrophinae has been the most contested issue though the uncertain placement of the xyloryctidae versus the concealer moths into which they might belong as subfamily has also been a considerable stumbling block numerous attempts have been made to divide the oecophorinae into tribes such as carcinini crossotocerini denisiini herrichini oecophorini peleopodini and pleurotini also placed here under this scheme are the cacochroini and orophiini which otherwise were included in the depressariinae but usually only when these were elevated to full family rank most of the proposed tribes were based on phenetic or qualitative analyses if not merely on the whim of

lfv is particularly suited for the measurement of velocities in liquid metals like steel or aluminium and is currently under development for metallurgical applications the measurement of flow velocities in hot and aggressive liquids such as liquid aluminium and molten glass constitutes one of the grand challenges of industrial fluid mechanics apart from liquids lfv can also be used to measure the velocity of solid materials as well as for detection of micro defects in their structures a lorentz force velocimetry system is called lorentz force flowmeter lff a lff measures the integrated or bulk lorentz force resulting from the interaction between a liquid metal in motion and an applied magnetic field in this case the characteristic length of the magnetic field is of the same order of magnitude as the dimensions of the channel it must be addressed that in the case where localized magnetic fields are used it is possible to perform local velocity measurements and thus the term lorentz force velocimeter is used the use of magnetic fields in flow measurement date back to 19th century when in 1832 michael faraday attempted to determine the velocity of the river thames faraday applied a method in which a

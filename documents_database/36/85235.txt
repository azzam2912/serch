data are collected at thousands of meteorological stations buoys and ships around the globe the longest running temperature record is the central england temperature data series which starts in 1659 the longest running quasi global record starts in 1850 in recent decades more extensive sampling of ocean temperatures at various depths have begun allowing estimates of ocean heat content but these do not form part of the global surface temperature datasets the global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature show a warming of 0 85 0 65 to 1 06 c in the period 1880 to 2012 based on multiple independently produced datasets this gives a trend of 0 064 0 015 c per decade over that period the trend is faster for land than ocean faster for arctic regions and faster since the 1970s than the longer period most of the observed warming occurred in two periods around 1900 to around 1940 and around 1970 onwards the cooling plateau from 1940 to 1970 has been mostly attributed to sulphate aerosol some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns attribution of the temperature change to natural or anthropogenic i

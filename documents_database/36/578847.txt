high fault coverage is particularly valuable during manufacturing test and techniques such as design for test dft and automatic test pattern generation are used to increase it in electronics for example stuck at fault coverage is measured by sticking each pin of the hardware model at logic 0 and logic 1 respectively and running the test vectors if at least one of the outputs differs from what is to be expected the fault is said to be detected conceptually the total number of simulation runs is twice the number of pins since each pin is stuck in one of two ways and both faults should be detected however there are many optimizations that can reduce the needed computation in particular often many non interacting faults can be simulated in one run and each simulation can be terminated as soon as a fault is detected a fault coverage test passes when at least a specified percentage of all possible faults can be detected if it does not pass at least three options are possible first the designer can augment or otherwise improve the vector set perhaps by using a more effective automatic test pattern generation tool second the circuit may be

a modern statement of boyle s law is the absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged within a closed system mathematically boyle s law can be stated as or where p is the pressure of the gas v is the volume of the gas and k is a constant the equation states that the product of pressure and volume is a constant for a given mass of confined gas and this holds as long as the temperature is constant for comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions the law can be usefully expressed as this equation shows that as volume increases the pressure of the gas decreases in proportion similarly as volume decreases the pressure of the gas increases the law was named after chemist and physicist robert boyle who published the original law in 1662 this relationship between pressure and volume was first noted by richard towneley and henry power in the 17th century robert boyle confirmed their discovery through experiments and published the results according to robert gunther and other authorities it was boyle

this process creates a film of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent this process differs from absorption in which a fluid the absorbate is dissolved by or permeates a liquid or solid the absorbent respectively adsorption is a surface phenomenon while absorption involves the whole volume of the material the term sorption encompasses both processes while desorption is the reverse of it similar to surface tension adsorption is a consequence of surface energy in a bulk material all the bonding requirements be they ionic covalent or metallic of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material however atoms on the surface of the adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates the exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption characteristic of weak van der waals forces or chemisorption characteristic of covalent bonding it may also occur due to electrostatic attraction adsorption is present in many natural physical biological and chemical systems and is widely used in industrial applications such as heterogeneous catalysts activated charcoal capturing and using waste heat to provide

the formula was devised by prof eugene meyer of the materials testing laboratory at the imperial school of technology charlottenburg germany circa 1908 it takes the form formula 1 where n usually lies between the values of 2 for fully strain hardened materials and 2 5 for fully annealed materials it is roughly related to the strain hardening coefficient in the equation for the true stress true strain curve by adding 2 note however that below approximately d the value of n can surpass 3 because of this meyer s law is often restricted to values of d greater than 0 5 mm up to the diameter of the indenter the variables k and n are also dependent on the size of the indenter despite this it has been found that the values can be related using the equation formula 2 meyer s law is often used to relate hardness values based on the fact that if the weight is halved and the diameter of the indenter is quartered for instance the hardness value for a test load of 3000 kg and a 10 mm indenter is the same for a test load of 750 kg and a 5 mm

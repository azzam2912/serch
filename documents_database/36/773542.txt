it is the imide derivative of phthalic anhydride it is a sublimable white solid that is slightly soluble in water but more so upon addition of base it is used as a precursor to other organic compounds as a masked source of ammonia phthalimide can be prepared by heating phthalic anhydride with aqueous ammonia giving 95 97 yield alternatively it may be prepared by treating the anhydride with ammonium carbonate or urea it can also be produced by ammoxidation of o xylene phthalimide is used as a precursor to anthranilic acid a precursor to azo dyes and saccharin alkyl phthalimides are useful precursors to amines in chemical synthesis especially in peptide synthesis where they are used to block both hydrogens and avoid racemization of the substrates alkyl halides can be converted to the n alkylphthalimide the amine is commonly liberated using hydrazine dimethylamine can also be used some examples of phthalimide drugs include thalidomide amphotalide taltrimide and talmetoprim with a trichloromethylthio substituent a phthalimide derived fungicide is folpet it forms salts upon treatment with bases such as sodium hydroxide the high acidity of the imido n h is the result of the pair of flanking electrophilic carbonyl groups potassium phthalimide

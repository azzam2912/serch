in heat exchanger analysis if the fluid inlet and outlet temperatures are specified or can be determined by simple energy balance the lmtd method can be used but when these temperatures are not available the ntu or the effectiveness method is used to define the effectiveness of a heat exchanger we need to find the maximum possible heat transfer that can be hypothetically achieved in a counter flow heat exchanger of infinite length therefore one fluid will experience the maximum possible temperature difference which is the difference of formula 1 the temperature difference between the inlet temperature of the hot stream and the inlet temperature of the cold stream the method proceeds by calculating the heat capacity rates i e mass flow rate multiplied by specific heat formula 2 and formula 3 for the hot and cold fluids respectively and denoting the smaller one as formula 4 a quantity is then found where formula 7 is the maximum heat that could be transferred between the fluids per unit time formula 8 must be used as it is the fluid with the lowest heat capacity rate that would in this hypothetical infinite length exchanger actually undergo the maximum possible temperature change

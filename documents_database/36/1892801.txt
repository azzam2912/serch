no adjacent vertices have the same color 2 no adjacent edges have the same color and 3 no edge and its endvertices are assigned the same color in 2005 zhang et al added a restriction to the definition of total coloring and proposed a new type of coloring defined as follows let g v e be a simple graph endowed with a total coloring and let u be a vertex of g the set of colors that occurs in the vertex u is defined as c u u uv uv e g two vertices u v v g are distinguishable if their color sets are distinct i e c u c v in graph theory a total coloring is an adjacent vertex distinguishing total coloring avd total coloring if it has the following additional property 4 for every two adjacent vertices u v of a graph g their colors sets are distinct from each other i e c u c v the adjacent vertex distinguishing total chromatic number g of a graph g is the least number of colors needed in an avd total coloring of g the following lower bound for the avd total chromatic number can be obtained

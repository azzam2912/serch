the system uses a bed of activated carbon beads to adsorb volatile organic compounds vocs from the exhaust gas evolving from the previous fixed bed and carbon rotor concentrators the fbc system forces the voc laden air through several perforated steel trays increasing the velocity of the air and allowing the sub millimeter carbon beads to fluidize or behave as if suspended in a liquid this increases the surface area of the carbon gas interaction making it more effective at capturing vocs the fluidized bed concentrator consists of five primary components industrial processes requiring ventilation including paint booths printing and chemical production exhaust the ventilated air to the fluidized bed concentrator fbc at room temperature the air first passes into the adsorption tower where it moves through six perforated trays of clean carbon beads the 0 7mm bead activated carbon bac fluidizes in the trays and captures the vocs as they intermix the saturated carbon beads are passed from the adsorber tower to the desorber tower where the beads are heated to 350 f and the vocs are released typically the adsorber tower is many times larger than the desorber tower leading to an air volume reduction and an increase

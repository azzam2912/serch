the relationship is well described in the literature the logarithmic profile of wind speeds is generally limited to the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere i e the surface layer of the atmospheric boundary layer the rest of the atmosphere is composed of the remaining part of the planetary boundary layer up to around 1000 m and the troposphere or free atmosphere in the free atmosphere geostrophic wind relationships should be used the equation to estimate the mean wind speed formula 1 at height formula 2 meters above the ground is formula 3 where formula 4 is the friction velocity m s formula 5 is the von k rm n constant 0 41 formula 6 is the zero plane displacement in metres formula 7 is the surface roughness in meters and formula 8 is a stability term where formula 9 is the obukhov length from monin obukhov similarity theory under neutral stability conditions formula 10 and formula 8 drops out and the equation is simplified to formula 12 zero plane displacement formula 6 is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings it

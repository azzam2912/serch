the two types of prrsv are distinguished by which genomic cluster they are associated with type 1 is associated with a lv cluster type 2 is associated with a vr2332 cluster prrsv is in the arteriviridae family and the order nidovirales it has a positive sense rna genome that is 15 kb long this genome consists of ten open reading frames orfs with a 5 untranslated region utr and a 3 utr prrsv causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in swine this syndrome results in failure during breeding and respiratory problems type 2 prrsv was first seen in the united states in 1987 however it has now spread worldwide to commercial swine facilities within the swine industry porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome causes interstitial pneumonia of grown swine and fetal death early gestation infection of a maternal swine can lead to embryonic infection during mid gestation the fetuses are protected as the virus can not pass the placenta however in late state gestation transplacental infection to and from fetuses can occur and large scale reproductive failure may occur as a member of the family arteriviridae prrsv has an in vivo and in vitro tropism for cells like macrophages or monocytes

it allows the dna modification to be targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus it is implemented both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems the cre lox recombination system has been particularly useful to help neuroscientists to study the brain in which complex cell types and neural circuits come together to generate cognition and behaviors nih blueprint for neuroscience research has created several hundreds of cre driver mouse lines which are currently used by the worldwide neuroscience community the system consists of a single enzyme cre recombinase that recombines a pair of short target sequences called the lox sequences this system can be implemented without inserting any extra supporting proteins or sequences the cre enzyme and the original lox site called the loxp sequence are derived from bacteriophage p1 placing lox sequences appropriately allows genes to be activated repressed or exchanged for other genes at a dna level many types of manipulations can be carried out the activity of the cre enzyme can be controlled so that it is expressed in a particular cell type or triggered by an external stimulus like a chemical signal or a heat shock these targeted dna changes are

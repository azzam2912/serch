this paradigm is also called independence architectures it was the basis for intel and hp development of the intel itanium architecture and hp later asserted that epic was merely an old term for the itanium architecture epic permits microprocessors to execute software instructions in parallel by using the compiler rather than complex on die circuitry to control parallel instruction execution this was intended to allow simple performance scaling without resorting to higher clock frequencies by 1989 researchers at hp recognized that reduced instruction set computer risc architectures were reaching a limit at one instruction per cycle they began an investigation into a new architecture later named epic the basis for the research was vliw in which multiple operations are encoded in every instruction and then processed by multiple execution units one goal of epic was to move the complexity of instruction scheduling from the cpu hardware to the software compiler which can do the instruction scheduling statically with help of trace feedback information this eliminates the need for complex scheduling circuitry in the cpu which frees up space and power for other functions including additional execution resources an equally important goal was to further exploit instruction level parallelism ilp by

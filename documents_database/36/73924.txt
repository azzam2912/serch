more precisely if there are two distinct reductions or sequences of reductions that can be applied to the same term then there exists a term that is reachable from both results by applying possibly empty sequences of additional reductions the theorem was proved in 1936 by alonzo church and j barkley rosser after whom it is named the theorem is symbolized by the adjacent diagram if term a can be reduced to both b and c then there must be a further term d possibly equal to either b or c to which both b and c can be reduced viewing the lambda calculus as an abstract rewriting system the church rosser theorem states that the reduction rules of the lambda calculus are confluent as a consequence of the theorem a term in the lambda calculus has at most one normal form justifying reference to the normal form of a given normalizable term the church rosser theorem also holds for many variants of the lambda calculus such as the simply typed lambda calculus many calculi with advanced type systems and gordon plotkin s beta value calculus plotkin also used a church rosser theorem to prove that the evaluation of functional

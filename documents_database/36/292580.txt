cathars believed in original sin and like gnostics believed temporal pleasure to be sinful or unwise the process of living thus inevitably incurred regret that required consolation to move nearer to god or to approach heaven it occurred only twice in a lifetime upon confirmation in the faith and upon impending death it was available to both men and women who made a commitment to the faith following the ceremony the consoled individual became a cathar perfect according to the albigenses and other cathars the consolamentum was an immersion or baptism in the holy spirit it implied reception of all spiritual gifts including absolution from sin spiritual regeneration the power to preach and elevation to a higher plane of perfection reference to the trinity was systematically replaced with the name of christ since the doctrine of the albigenses and cathars professed a single unified deity their christology resembled modalistic monarchism in the west and adoptionism in the east the ritual took various forms some used the entire new testament scripture whilst others relied on extracts such as the gospel attributed to john while administering consolation there were reportedly some remote cases where holy water was used as a cleansing agent

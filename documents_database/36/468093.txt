it is so called because the antenna feed is offset to the side of the reflector in contrast to the common front feed parabolic antenna where the feed antenna is suspended in front of the dish on its axis as in a front fed parabolic dish the feed is located at the focal point of the reflector but the reflector is an asymmetric segment of a paraboloid so the focus is located to the side the purpose of this design is to move the feed antenna and its supports out of the path of the incoming radio waves in an ordinary front fed dish antenna the feed structure and its supports are located in the path of the incoming beam of radio waves partially obstructing them casting a shadow on the dish reducing the radio power received in technical terms this reduces the aperture efficiency of the antenna reducing its gain in the offset design the feed is positioned outside the area of the beam usually below it on a boom sticking out from the bottom edge of the dish the beam axis of the antenna the axis of the incoming or outgoing radio waves is skewed at an angle

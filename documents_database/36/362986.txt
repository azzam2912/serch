it may be defined as mass of a certain volume of a substance divided by mass of same volume of hydrogen vapour density mass of n molecules of gas mass of n molecules of hydrogen thus vapour density molar mass of gas molar mass of h vapour density molar mass of gas 2 016 vapour density molar mass for example vapour density of mixture of no and no is 38 3 vapour density is a unitless quantity in many web sources particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the u s vapour density is defined with respect to air not hydrogen air is given a vapour density of one for this use air has a molecular weight of 28 97 atomic mass units and all other gas and vapour molecular weights are divided by this number to derive their vapour density for example acetone has a vapour density of 2 in relation to air that means acetone vapour is twice as heavy as air this can be seen by dividing the molecular weight of acetone 58 1 by that of air 28 97 which equals 2 with this definition the vapour density would indicate whether

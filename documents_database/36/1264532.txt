compared with other low carbon power sources wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated according to the ipcc in assessments of the life cycle global warming potential of energy sources wind turbines have a median value of between 15 and 11 geq kwh depending on whether off or onshore turbines are being assessed onshore wind farms can have a significant impact on the landscape as typically they need to be spread over more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas which can lead to industrialization of the countryside and habitat loss conflicts arise especially in scenic and culturally important landscapes siting restrictions such as setbacks may be implemented to limit the impact land between the turbines and access roads can still be used for farming and grazing habitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest impact of wind farms on wildlife wind turbines like many other human activities and buildings also increase bat and bird deaths a summary of the existing field studies compiled in 2010 from the national wind coordinating collaborative identified fewer than 14 and typically less than 4 bird deaths per

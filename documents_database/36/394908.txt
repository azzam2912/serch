these properties allow precedence relations to be defined between the terminals of the grammar a parser that exploits these relations is considerably simpler than more general purpose parsers such as lalr parsers operator precedence parsers can be constructed for a large class of context free grammars operator precedence grammars rely on the following three precedence relations between the terminals these operator precedence relations allow to delimit the handles in the right sentential forms formula 1 marks the left end formula 2 appears in the interior of the handle and formula 3 marks the right end contrary to other shift reduce parsers all nonterminals are considered equal for the purpose of identifying handles the relations do not have the same properties as their un dotted counterparts e g formula 4 does not generally imply formula 5 and formula 6 does not follow from formula 7 furthermore formula 8 does not generally hold and formula 9 is possible let us assume that between the terminals and there is always exactly one precedence relation suppose that is the end of the string then for all terminals we define formula 10 and formula 11 if we remove all nonterminals and place the correct precedence

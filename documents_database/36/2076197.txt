it aims at providing the fundamental abstractions for dealing with concurrency distribution interaction decentralization reactivity autonomy and dynamic reconfiguration sarl is platform independent and agent s architecture agnostic it provides a set of agent oriented first class abstractions directly at the language level see the section on the concepts nevertheless it supports the integration and the mapping of concepts provided by other agent oriented metamodels sarl itself exploits this extension mechanism for defining its own extensions organizational event driven etc an important feature of the sarl programming language is its native support for holonic multiagent systems and recursive agents also called holons the metamodel of sarl is based on four main concepts agent capacity space and skill the core metamodel of sarl is presented in figure 1 and the main concepts are colored in light blue each of them are detailed in the following sections as well as the corresponding piece of sarl code to illustrate their practical use in sarl a multiagent system mas is a collection of agents interacting together in shared distributed spaces each agent has a collection of capacities describing what it is able to perform its personal competences each capacity may then be realized implemented

supervised by stuart trippett and stephen davidson sheldon is distinguished for his pioneering and wide ranging contributions to catalytic oxidation biocatalysis and green chemistry and for bridging the traditional gap between organic synthesis and catalysis he introduced the concept of the e factor which is now used by companies globally for assessing the efficiency and environmental impact of chemical processes he has consistently emphasised the need for a new paradigm in the evaluation of efficiency in chemical processes from the traditional concept of chemical yield to one that assigns value to waste minimisation and is an avid proponent of elegance and precision in organic synthesis sheldon was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 2015 and a fellow of the royal society of chemistry frsc in 1980 he was awarded the green chemistry award by the royal society of chemistry in 2010 and made an honorary fellow of the same society in 2018

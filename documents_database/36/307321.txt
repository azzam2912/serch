the game is a first person shooter with a variety of weapons and levels but has a hillbilly theme primarily taking place in a fictional arkansas town many of the weapons and power ups border on nonsensical and in some ways it is a parody of both first shooter games and rural american life it features music by psychobilly and cowpunk artists such as the beat farmers and mojo nixon the game has been re released on gog com and steam with support for windows and macos redneck rampage is a first person shooter and offers a variety of ways for the character to regenerate health or hit points these power ups consist of moon pies pork rinds beer and liquor a small supply of each can be carried for future use the two exceptions were pork rinds and delicious googoo clusters which were used automatically upon being picked up each of these power ups had distinct disadvantages the more food the character ate the more flatulent he became represented by a gut meter in the user display making it difficult to sneak up on enemies as the character would move forward and make a distinct fart sound frequently after

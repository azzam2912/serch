his father was a professor of biochemistry and his mother was a medical doctor his elder brother evgenii was conscripted soon after beginning of the nazi invasion in june 1941 and lost his life in 1947 broude graduated from the moscow institute of chemical engineering and was directed to kiev ukraine to the institute of physics of the ukrainian academy of sciences for developing and installing equipment for low temperature optical spectroscopy here he developed interest in the low temperature spectroscopy studied quantum mechanics and group theory and very soon became an active and inventive experimental physicist in his first break through papers broude discovered in the low temperature spectra of crystalline benzine a triplet of absorption bands strongly polarized along the crystallographic axes methodically this success was only possible thanks to a breakthrough in experimental techniques the invention of a microprocessor that allowed taking spectra of minor crystallites in polarized light this experimental result also was of crucial scientific importance because it provided a firm scientific ground for identification strongly polarized absorption bands in the spectra of molecular crystals with exciton for these reasons broude papers of the spectra of benzine nearly immediately became the classics the next great

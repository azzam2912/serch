in humans cxorf59 is located on chromosome x at locus xp21 1 of the human genome cxorf59 is most commonly known as cilia and flagella associated protein 47 cfap47 in other species cfap47 is a 3187 amino acid protein that has seven splice variants and contains 64 exons genecard listed aliases for cxorf59 as cilia and flagella associated protein 47 cfap47 calponin homology domain containing protein 2 chdc2 flj3660 cxorf22 and cxorf30 orthologs have been found in mammalia aves reptilia amphibia osteichthyes sarcopterygii and actinopterygii ascidiacea gastropoda cephalopoda insecta and demospongiae there are no paralogs within the human genome cxorf59 is a protein coding gene that is confirmed to be expressed in 27 different tissues the liver testis thyroid brain and endometrium were higher in reads per kilobase of transcript rpkm while this gene is associated with cilia and flagella there is no current functional information available on this protein cxorf59 is also related to calponin a calcium binding protein in the 324 to 403 base pair region there is a calponin homology domain calponin homology domains are found in cytoskeletal and signal transduction proteins they are composed of four alpha helices and are actin binding

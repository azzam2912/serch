in this system there is a conserved quantity h the hamiltonian which is given by formula 5 with this defined one can plot a curve of constant h in the phase space of system the phase space is a graph with formula 4 along the horizontal axis and formula 7 on the vertical axis see the thumbnail to the right the type of resulting curve depends upon the value of h if formula 8 then no curve exist formula 7 must be imaginary if formula 10 then the curve will be a simple closed curve see curve which is nearly circular for small h and becomes eye shaped when h approaches the upper bound these curves correspond to the pendulum swinging periodically from side to side if formula 11 then the curve is open and this corresponds to the pendulum forever swinging through complete circles in this system the separatix is the curve that corresponds to formula 12 it separates hence the name the phase space into two distinct areas the region inside the separatrix has all those phase space curves which correspond to oscillating motion back and forth of the pendulum whose equation of motion is given above whereas

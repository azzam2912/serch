in some forms aztec tanoan has also included the zuni isolate this proposed classification has not been definitively demonstrated largely because of slow progress in the reconstruction of the intermediate stages of the two language families involved but is still considered promising by many linguists the grouping was originally proposed by edward sapir in his 1921 classification but it was not until 1937 that supporting evidence was published by benjamin lee whorf and g l trager their proposal included some 67 proposed cognates but subsequent reviews have found most of them to be unconvincing monosyllables onomatopoeia a small number of their proposed cognates do seem to have some merit and in his 1997 review of the hypothesis lyle campbell states that the proposal is not implausible but requires detailed study a recent article by jane h hill argues that the evidence cited for the genetic relation by whorf and trager is better understood as a result of language contact between the uto aztecan and tanoan proto languages the following word pairs are the proposed cognates from whorf trager 1937 and davis 1979 considered promising by campbell 1997 273

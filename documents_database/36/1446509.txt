its purpose was to shorten the laborious and error prone computations of tide prediction such machines usually provided predictions valid from hour to hour and day to day for a year or more ahead the first tide predicting machine designed and built in 1872 3 and followed by two larger machines on similar principles in 1876 and 1879 was conceived by sir william thomson who later became lord kelvin thomson had introduced the method of harmonic analysis of tidal patterns in the 1860s and the first machine was designed by thomson with the collaboration of edward roberts assistant at the uk hm nautical almanac office and of alexander l g who constructed it in the us another tide predicting machine on a different pattern was designed by william ferrel and built in 1881 2 developments and improvements continued in the uk us and germany through the first half of the 20th century the machines became widely used for constructing official tidal predictions for general marine navigation they came to be regarded as of military strategic importance during world war i and again during the second world war when the us no 2 tide predicting machine described below was classified along

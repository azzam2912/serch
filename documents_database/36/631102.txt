for plants this could be by in vitro storage freezing cuttings from the plant or stocking the seeds e g in a seedbank for animals this is the freezing of sperm and eggs in zoological freezers until further need with corals fragments are taken which are stored in water tanks under controlled conditions plant genetic material in a gene bank is preserved at 196 celsius in liquid nitrogen as mature seed dry or tissue meristems accession is the common term given to an individual sample in a gene bank such as a distinct species or variety in plants it is possible to unfreeze the material and propagate it however in animals a living female is required for artificial insemination while it is often difficult to use frozen animal sperm and eggs there are many examples of it being done successfully in an effort to conserve agricultural biodiversity gene banks are used to store and conserve the plant genetic resources of major crop plants and their crop wild relatives there are many gene banks all over the world with the svalbard global seed vault being probably the most famous one the database of the largest gene banks in the world can

petrick 1931 2006 in 1956 for determining all minimum sum of products solutions from a prime implicant chart petrick s method is very tedious for large charts but it is easy to implement on a computer following is the function we want to reduce the prime implicant chart from the quine mccluskey algorithm is as follows based on the x marks in the table above build a product of sums of the rows where each row is added and columns are multiplied together use the distributive law to turn that expression into a sum of products also use the following equivalences to simplify the final expression x xy x and xx x and x x x now use again the following equivalence to further reduce the equation x xy x choose products with fewest terms in this example there are two products with three terms choose term or terms with fewest total literals in our example the two products both expand to six literals total each so either one can be used in general application of petrick s method is tedious for large charts but it is easy to implement on a computer

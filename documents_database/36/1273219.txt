literature from that period used the terms anti gravity anti gravitation baricentric counterbary electrogravitics egrav g projects gravitics gravity control and gravity propulsion their publicized goals were to develop and discover technologies and theories for the manipulation of gravity or gravity like fields for propulsion although general relativity theory appeared to prohibit anti gravity propulsion several programs were funded to develop it through gravitation research from 1955 to 1974 the names of many contributors to general relativity and those of the golden age of general relativity have appeared among documents about the institutions that had served as the theoretical research components of those programs the existence and 1950s emergence of the gravity control propulsion research have not been a subject of controversy for aerospace writers critics and conspiracy theory advocates but their rationale effectiveness and longevity have been the objects of contested views mainstream newspapers popular magazines technical journals and declassified papers reported the existence of the gravity control propulsion research for example the title of the march 1956 aero digest article about the intensified interest was anti gravity booming a v cleaver made the following statement about the programs in his article the gravitics programs had not been evinced

it is also known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 42 and uncharacterized protein c11orf42 with no other aliases the gene is mostly conserved in mammals but it has also been found in rodents reptiles fish and worms the gene is located on 11p15 4 and has three exons c11orf42 starts at 6205568 bp and ends at 6211319 bp c11orf42 spans 5752 base pairs and encodes in the negative strand of chromosome 11 on chromosome 11 the genes fam160a2 gene and or52w1 are neighbors to c11orf42 fam160a2 encodes in the positive strand of chromosome 11 or52w1 encodes in the negative strand of chromosome 11 c11orf42 is expressed in a total of seventy four organs in a study of ninety five individuals twenty seven different tissues had rna sequencing completed to determine the tissue specificity of the protein coding genes c11orf42 is expressed in a variety of tissues although it is most broadly expressed in the skin as well as the testes according to the est profile of c11orf42 the protein is abundant in the bladder brain and testis it was associated with bladder carcinoma and seen in the adult developmental stage c11orf42 was observed in a rna microarray that looked

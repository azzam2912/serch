he formally described his findings in a siggraph paper in 1985 called an image synthesizer in 1997 perlin was awarded an academy award for technical achievement for creating the algorithm perlin did not apply for any patents on the algorithm but in 2001 he was granted a patent for the use of 3d implementations of simplex noise for texture synthesis simplex noise has the same purpose but uses a simpler space filling grid simplex noise alleviates some of the problems with perlin s classic noise among them computational complexity and visually significant directional artifacts perlin noise is a procedural texture primitive a type of gradient noise used by visual effects artists to increase the appearance of realism in computer graphics the function has a pseudo random appearance yet all of its visual details are the same size this property allows it to be readily controllable multiple scaled copies of perlin noise can be inserted into mathematical expressions to create a great variety of procedural textures synthetic textures using perlin noise are often used in cgi to make computer generated visual elements such as object surfaces fire smoke or clouds appear more natural by imitating the controlled random appearance of textures

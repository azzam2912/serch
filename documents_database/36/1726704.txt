the idea of shaping user behavior is widely evident throughout the built environment architecture regulates behavior its constraints are simultaneous although are enforced not through the will of the state or through the will of a community its constraints are enforced through the physical power of a context or environment when we discuss disciplinary architecture we can consider two distinctive elements there are those architectures of control which physically prevent or direct a certain type of behavior and there are those designs that regulate user behavior through the psychological effects of the surrounding built environments architects and designers are in a position where they can cleverly put into practice physical structures to direct or prohibit certain behaviours or activities within a given space these architectures of control can be as simple as the implementation of fencing gates and pathways to lead people in certain directions or prevent them from accessing restricted areas furthermore architectures of control can be far more specific in terms of certain designs for instance in educational environments windows are often placed at certain heights to prevent students from becoming distracted by events outside although often unnoticed these physical considerations play a valuable role in maintaining order

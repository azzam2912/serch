heat seeking missiles were responsible for about 80 of air losses in operation desert storm the most common method of infrared countermeasure is deploying flares as the heat produced by the flares creates hundreds of targets for the missile an infrared sensor that is sensitive to heat such as emitted from an aircraft engine is included on missiles launched by man portable air defense systems manpad using a steering system the missile is programmed to home in on the infrared heat signal because they are portable manpad missiles have a limited range burning out a few seconds after launch because they are expensive such countermeasure systems have been seldom used primarily on military aircraft countermeasure systems are usually integrated into the aircraft such as in the fuselage wing or nose of the aircraft or fixed to an outer portion of the aircraft depending on where the systems are mounted they can increase drag reducing flight performance and increasing operating cost much time and money is spent on testing maintaining servicing and upgrading systems these procedures require that the aircraft are grounded for a period of time conventional man portable air defense systems manpads launched missiles include an infrared sensor that

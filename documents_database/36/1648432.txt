these include brachiopods eurypterids conodonts nektaspids trilobites and orthoconic cephalopods the environment of deposition is considered to be anoxic and occasionally euxinic cold bottom waters as indicated by the lack of bioturbation and most epibenthic fauna besides a small amount of transiently colonizing brachiopods during temporary oxic conditions it was deposited in the immediate aftermath of the hirnantian glaciation the most likely primary cause of the ordovician silurian extinction event the preservation of fossils in the soom shale is the opposite of that of normal fossil deposits things that in typical preservation conditions are not preserved in the fossil record like soft tissue are preserved in exquisite detail while hard parts exoskeleton etc that are normally preserved in the fossil record are demineralized and are therefore by comparison poorly preserved usually being preserved in the form of a mould there is almost no taphonomic distortion with little evidence of transport current alignment and no evidence of scavenging the process of preservation for soft tissues is under debate but possibly could involve replacement by aluminosilicates but this could just be an artifact of diagenesis and metamorphism

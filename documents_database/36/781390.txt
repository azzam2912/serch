perforans prima passes posteriorly between the pectineus and adductor brevis sometimes it perforates the latter it then pierces the adductor magnus close to the linea aspera it gives branches to the adductores brevis and magnus biceps femoris and gluteus maximus and anastomoses with the inferior gluteal medial and lateral femoral circumflex and second perforating arteries the second perforating artery a perforans secunda larger than the first pierces the tendons of the adductores brevis and magnus and divides into ascending and descending branches which supply the posterior femoral muscles anastomosing with the first and third perforating the second artery frequently arises in common with the first the nutrient artery of the femur is usually given off from the second perforating artery when two nutrient arteries exist they usually spring from the first and third perforating vessels the third perforating artery a perforans tertia is given off below the adductor brevis it pierces the adductor magnus and divides into branches which supply the posterior femoral muscles anastomosing above with the higher perforating arteries and below with the terminal branches of the profunda and the muscular branches of the popliteal the nutrient artery of the femur may arise from this branch the termination

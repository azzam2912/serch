coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive sense single stranded rna genome and with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry the genomic size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases the largest for an rna virus the name coronavirus is derived from the latin corona meaning crown or halo and refers to the characteristic appearance of virions under electron microscopy e m with a fringe of large bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of a royal crown or of the solar corona this morphology is created by the viral spike s peplomers which are proteins that populate the surface of the virus and determine host tropism proteins that contribute to the overall structure of all coronaviruses are the spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n in the specific case of the sars coronavirus see below a defined receptor binding domain on s mediates the attachment of the virus to its cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 some coronaviruses specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup a also have a shorter spike like protein called hemagglutinin esterase he coronaviruses were first described in the 1960s from the nasal cavities of patients with the common cold these viruses

namely it is an assignment of colors to vertices of an oriented graph that equivalently an oriented graph coloring of a graph g is an oriented graph h whose vertices represent colors and whose arcs represent valid orientations between colors such that there exists a homomorphism from g to h an oriented chromatic number of a graph g is the fewest colors needed in an oriented coloring it is usually denoted by formula 7 the same definition can be extended to undirected graphs as well by defining the oriented chromatic number of an undirected graph to be the largest oriented chromatic number of any of its orientations the oriented chromatic number of a directed 5 cycle is five if the cycle is colored by four or fewer colors then either two adjacent vertices have the same color or two vertices two steps apart have the same color in the latter case the edges connecting these two vertices to the vertex between them are inconsistently oriented both have the same pair of colors but with opposite orientations thus no coloring with four or fewer colors is possible however giving each vertex its own unique color leads to a valid oriented coloring

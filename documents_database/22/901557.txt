when an object with a certain resolution is represented on a display with lower resolution the imperfections due to the loss of information are known as aliasing this can happen with geometric objects vector graphics vector fonts or 3d graphics the most common kind of visual aliasing is when a smooth object such as a line appears jagged because the pixels are large enough to be easily distinguished by the naked eye these effects can be reduced by anti aliasing techniques e g adjusting the colour or transparency of a pixel according to how much of it is covered by the object sub pixel rendering for example if the image of a ship of length viewed side on is 500 pixels long the nominal resolution pixel size on the side of the ship facing the camera is now sub pixel resolution of well resolved features can measure ship movements which are an order of magnitude 10 smaller movement is specifically mentioned here because measuring absolute positions requires an accurate lens model and known reference points within the image to achieve sub pixel position accuracy small movements can however be measured down to 1 cm with simple calibration procedures specific fit

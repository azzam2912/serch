he continued his studies at tufts university in 1977 1978 he received his doctorate from massachusetts institute of technology in 1982 under the direction of richard melrose with dissertation higher asymptotics of the complex monge amp re equation and geometry of cr manifolds from 1982 to 1987 lee was an assistant professor at harvard university at the university of washington he became in 1987 an assistant professor in 1989 an associate professor and in 1996 a full professor his research deals with among other topics the yamabe problem geometry of and analysis on cr manifolds and differential geometry questions of general relativity such as the constraint equations in the initial value problem of einstein equations and existence of einstein metrics on manifolds in 2012 he received jointly with david jerison the stefan bergman prize from the american mathematical society lee created a mathematical software package named ricci for performing tensor calculations in differential geometry ricci named in honor of gregorio ricci curbastro and completed in 1992 consists of 7000 lines of mathematica code the software package is distributed via the internet and was chosen for inclusion in the mathsource library of mathematica packages supported by wolfram research

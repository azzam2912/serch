when moroni got too old to lead an army any longer moronihah received command of his father s armies in the 39th year of the reign of the judges or 53 bc moronihah had successfully defended the nephites against dissenters it was his first recorded victory over the enemies of the nephites when the nephite dissenter coriantumr invaded a couple years later however he moronihah had less success than before even after taking advantage of the opportunity that coriantumr had given him on his second try he sent lehi with an army to cut off the dissenters and the lamanites and coriantumr was killed in the battle along with many others moronihah himself retook possession of zarahemla and set at liberty the lamanite prisoners the nephites had captured there over the next decade more nephites dissented to the lamanites and went to battle against the nephites because of their wickedness the nephites were unable to obtain all their cities back although with moronihah s help they were able to obtain half of them this he did by preaching repentance to the nephites with nephi and his brother lehi and then leading the repentant nephites to regain their cities and possessions

spambots usually create accounts and send spam messages with them web hosts and website operators have responded by banning spammers leading to an ongoing struggle between them and spammers in which spammers find new ways to evade the bans and anti spam programs and hosts counteract these methods e mail spambots harvest e mail addresses from material found on the internet in order to build mailing lists for sending unsolicited e mail also known as spam such spambots are web crawlers that can gather e mail addresses from websites newsgroups special interest group sig postings and chat room conversations because e mail addresses have a distinctive format such spambots are easy to code a number of programs and approaches have been devised to foil spambots one such technique is address munging in which an e mail address is deliberately modified so that a human reader and or human controlled web browser can interpret it but spambots cannot this has led to the evolution of more sophisticated spambots that are able to recover e mail addresses from character strings that appear to be munged or instead can render the text into a web browser and then scrape it for e mail

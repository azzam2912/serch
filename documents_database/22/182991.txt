for example every projective variety over a field k is proper over k a scheme x of finite type over the complex numbers for example a variety is proper over c if and only if the space x c of complex points with the classical euclidean topology is compact and hausdorff a closed immersion is proper a morphism is finite if and only if it is proper and quasi finite a morphism f x y of schemes is called universally closed if for every scheme z with a morphism z y the projection from the fiber product is a closed map of the underlying topological spaces a morphism of schemes is called proper if it is separated of finite type and universally closed ega ii 5 4 1 one also says that x is proper over y in particular a variety x over a field k is said to be proper over k if the morphism x spec k is proper for any natural number n projective space p over a commutative ring r is proper over r projective morphisms are proper but not all proper morphisms are projective for example there is a smooth proper complex variety of dimension

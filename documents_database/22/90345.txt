its main goals are reducing drag and wind noise minimizing noise emission and preventing undesired lift forces and other causes of aerodynamic instability at high speeds air is also considered a fluid in this case for some classes of racing vehicles it may also be important to produce downforce to improve traction and thus cornering abilities the frictional force of aerodynamic drag increases significantly with vehicle speed as early as the 1920s engineers began to consider automobile shape in reducing aerodynamic drag at higher speeds by the 1950s german and british automotive engineers were systematically analyzing the effects of automotive drag for the higher performance vehicles by the late 1960s scientists also became aware of the significant increase in sound levels emitted by automobiles at high speed these effects were understood to increase the intensity of sound levels for adjacent land uses at a non linear rate soon highway engineers began to design roadways to consider the speed effects of aerodynamic drag produced sound levels and automobile manufacturers considered the same factors in vehicle design an aerodynamic automobile will integrate the wheel arcs and lights into the overall shape to reduce drag it will be streamlined for example it does

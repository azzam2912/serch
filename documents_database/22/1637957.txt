this technique can be used for beta decay studies related to beta feeding measurements within the full decay energy window for nuclei far from stability it is implemented with a special type of detector the total absorption spectrometer tas made of a scintillator crystal that almost completely surrounds the activity to be measured covering a solid angle of approximately 4 also in an ideal case it should be thick enough to have a peak efficiency close to 100 in this way its total efficiency is also very close to 100 this is one of the reasons why it is called total absorption spectroscopy finally it should be blind to any other type of radiation the gamma rays produced in the decay under study are collected by photomultipliers attached to the scintillator material this technique may solve the problem of the pandemonium effect there is a change in philosophy when measuring with a tas instead of detecting the individual gamma rays as high resolution detectors do it will detect the gamma cascades emitted in the decay then the final energy spectrum will not be a collection of different energy peaks coming from the different transitions as can be expected in the

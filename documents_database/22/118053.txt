as the wing rises the angle of attack and lift coefficient decrease which tend to restore the wing to its original angle of attack conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient which causes the wing to descend as the wing descends the angle of attack and lift coefficient increase which tends to restore the wing to its original angle of attack for this reason the angle of attack is stable when it is less than the stalling angle the aircraft displays damping in roll when the wing is stalled and the angle of attack is greater than the stalling angle any increase in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient that causes the wing to descend as the wing descends the angle of attack increases which causes the lift coefficient to decrease and the angle of attack to increase conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise as the wing rises the angle of attack decreases and causes the lift coefficient to increase further towards the maximum lift coefficient for this reason the angle of attack is unstable when it is

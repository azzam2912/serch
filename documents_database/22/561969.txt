hennessy at stanford university between 1981 and 1984 mips investigated a type of instruction set architecture isa now called reduced instruction set computer risc its implementation as a microprocessor with very large scale integration vlsi semiconductor technology and the effective exploitation of risc architectures with optimizing compilers mips together with the ibm 801 and berkeley risc were the three research projects that pioneered and popularized risc technology in the mid 1980s in recognition of the impact mips made on computing hennessey was awarded the ieee john von neumann medal in 2000 by the ieee shared with david a patterson the eckert mauchly award in 2001 by the association for computing machinery the seymour cray computer engineering award in 2001 by the ieee computer society and again with david patterson the turing award in 2017 by the acm the project was initiated in 1981 in response to reports of similar projects at ibm the 801 and the university of california berkeley the risc mips was conducted by hennessy and his graduate students until its conclusion in 1984 hennessey founded mips computer systems in the same year to commercialize the technology developed by the project in 1985 mips computer systems announced a

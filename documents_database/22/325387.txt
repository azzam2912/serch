then is here we interpret formula 4 as formula 5 explicitly is logarithmically convex if and only if for all and all the two following equivalent conditions hold similarly is strictly logarithmically convex if and only if in the above two expressions strict inequality holds for all the above definition permits to be zero but if is logarithmically convex and vanishes anywhere in then it vanishes everywhere in the interior of if is a differentiable function defined on an interval then is logarithmically convex if and only if the following condition holds for all and in this is equivalent to the condition that whenever and are in and moreover is strictly logarithmically convex if and only if these inequalities are always strict if is twice differentiable then it is logarithmically convex if and only if for all in if the inequality is always strict then is strictly logarithmically convex however the converse is false it is possible that is strictly logarithmically convex and that for some we have formula 10 for example if formula 11 then is strictly logarithmically convex but formula 12 a logarithmically convex function f is a convex function since it is the composite of the increasing

in the case of diabetes mellitus it is a low rate of continuous insulin supply needed for such purposes as controlling cellular glucose and amino acid uptake together with a bolus of insulin the basal insulin completes the total insulin needs of an insulin dependent person an insulin pump and wristop controller is one way to arrange for a closely controlled basal insulin rate the slow release insulins e g lantus and levemir can provide a similar effect in healthy individuals basal rate is monitored by the pancreas which provides a regular amount of insulin at all times the body requires this flow of insulin to enable the body to utilize glucose in the blood stream so the energy in glucose can be used to carry out bodily functions basal rate requirements can differ for individuals depending on the activities they will carry out on that particular day for example if one is not highly active on a certain day they will have a decreased basal rate because they are not using a lot of energy on the other hand basal rate increases dramatically when an individual is highly active basal rates often even vary from hour to hour throughout

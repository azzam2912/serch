the notion gives a homotopy theoretic generalization of a scheme a derived stack is a stacky generalization of a derived scheme over a field of characteristic zero the theory is equivalent to that of a differential graded scheme by definition a differential graded scheme is obtained by gluing affine differential graded schemes with respect to tale topology it was introduced by maxim kontsevich as the first approach to derived algebraic geometry and was developed further by mikhail kapranov and ionut ciocan fontanine just as affine algebraic geometry is equivalent in categorical sense to the theory of commutative rings commonly called commutative algebra affine derived algebraic geometry over characteristic zero is equivalent to the theory of commutative differential graded rings one of the main example of derived schemes comes from the derived intersection of subschemes of a scheme giving the koszul complex for example let formula 6 then we can get a derived scheme where is the tale spectrum since we can construct a resolution the derived ring formula 10 is the koszul complex formula 11 the truncation of this derived scheme to amplitude formula 12 provides a classical model motivating derived algebraic geometry notice that if we have a projective

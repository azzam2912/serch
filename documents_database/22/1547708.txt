it is native to southeastern and eastern europe middle asia caucasus siberia china mongolia new zealand and parts of north america culms are 50 100 cm long and 10 12 mm in diameter wheat is the primary source of grain in the human food supply worldwide today especially with the current population boom there is a strong pressure to increase wheat production to sustain the global food demand several factors threaten crop expansion into new areas scientists have been investigating evolutionary relatives of wheat to incorporate into the modern cultivar to improve its resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses leymus racemosus is one such relative that has shown tremendous potential in this regard leymus racemosus is a perennial grass species that inhabits a wide variety of terrains such as wet forests drylands coasts and soils with high saline concentrations introgression lines of l racemosus have shown a stronger response to heat stress in terms of increased grain yields per spike this is significant because heat stress significantly limits wheat production in tropical climates high temperatures impose morphological changes that decrease production wheat grows optimally at temperatures between 18 24 degrees celsius studies have shown that wheat exposure to temperatures between

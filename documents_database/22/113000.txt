solutions of sulfide salts are corrosive sulfide also refers to chemical compounds large families of inorganic and organic compounds e g lead sulfide and dimethyl sulfide hydrogen sulfide hs and bisulfide sh are the conjugate acids of sulfide the sulfide ion s does not exist in aqueous alkaline solutions of nas instead sulfide converts to hydrosulfide upon treatment with an acid sulfide salts convert to hydrogen sulfide oxidation of sulfide is a complicated process depending on the conditions the oxidation can produce elemental sulfur polysulfides polythionates sulfite or sulfate metal sulfides react with halogens forming sulfur and metal salts aqueous solutions of transition metals cations react with sulfide sources hs nahs nas to precipitate solid sulfides such inorganic sulfides typically have very low solubility in water and many are related to minerals with the same composition see below one famous example is the bright yellow species cds or cadmium yellow the black tarnish formed on sterling silver is ags such species are sometimes referred to as salts in fact the bonding in transition metal sulfides is highly covalent which gives rise to their semiconductor properties which in turn is related to the deep colors several have practical applications as pigments

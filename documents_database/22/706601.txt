this natural process is distinct from the intentional creation of dwarf breeds called dwarfing this process has occurred many times throughout evolutionary history with examples including dinosaurs like europasaurus and modern animals such as elephants and their relatives this process and other island genetics artifacts can occur not only on islands but also in other situations where an ecosystem is isolated from external resources and breeding this can include caves desert oases isolated valleys and isolated mountains sky islands insular dwarfism is one aspect of the more general island effect or foster s rule which posits that when mainland animals colonize islands small species tend to evolve larger bodies island gigantism and large species tend to evolve smaller bodies there are several proposed explanations for the mechanism which produces such dwarfism one is a selective process where only smaller animals trapped on the island survive as food periodically declines to a borderline level the smaller animals need fewer resources and smaller territories and so are more likely to get past the break point where population decline allows food sources to replenish enough for the survivors to flourish smaller size is also advantageous from a reproductive standpoint as it entails shorter

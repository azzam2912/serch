the principle was stated as a theorem of propositional logic by russell and whitehead in principia mathematica as double negation elimination and double negation introduction are two valid rules of replacement they are the inferences that if a is true then not not a is true and its converse that if not not a is true then a is true the rule allows one to introduce or eliminate a negation from a formal proof the rule is based on the equivalence of for example it is false that it is not raining and it is raining the double negation introduction rule is and the double negation elimination rule is where formula 2 is a metalogical symbol representing can be replaced in a proof with in logics that have both rules negation is an involution the double negation introduction rule may be written in sequent notation the double negation elimination rule may be written as in rule form and or as a tautology plain propositional calculus sentence and these can be combined together into a single biconditional formula since biconditionality is an equivalence relation any instance of a in a well formed formula can be replaced by a leaving unchanged the

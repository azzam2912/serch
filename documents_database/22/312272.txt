the solutions to the equation are mathematical functions which correspond directly to the field as functions of time and space since the field equation is a partial differential equation there are families of solutions which represent a variety of physical possibilities usually there is not just a single equation but a set of coupled equations which must be solved simultaneously field equations are not ordinary differential equations since a field depends on space and time which requires at least two variables whereas the wave equation the diffusion equation and the continuity equation all have standard forms and various special cases or generalizations there is no single special equation referred to as the field equation the topic broadly splits into equations of classical field theory and quantum field theory classical field equations describe many physical properties like temperature of a substance velocity of a fluid stresses in an elastic material electric and magnetic fields from a current etc they also describe the fundamental forces of nature like electromagnetism and gravity in quantum field theory particles or systems of particles like electrons and photons are associated with fields allowing for infinite degrees of freedom unlike finite degrees of freedom in particle mechanics

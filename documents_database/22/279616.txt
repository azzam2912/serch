the original geode processor core itself is derived from the cyrix mediagx platform which was acquired in national s merger with cyrix in 1997 amd bought the geode business from national in august 2003 to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products amd expanded the geode series to two classes of processor the mediagx derived geode gx and lx and the modern athlon derived geode nx geode processors are optimized for low power consumption and low cost while still remaining compatible with software written for the x86 platform the mediagx derived processors lack modern features such as sse and a large on die l1 cache but these are offered on the more recent athlon derived geode nx geode processors tightly integrate some of the functions normally provided by a separate chipset such as the northbridge whilst the processor family is best suited for thin client set top box and embedded computing applications it can be found in unusual applications such as the nao robot and the win enterprise ip pbx the one laptop per child project used the gx series geode processor in olpc xo 1 prototypes but moved to the geode lx for production the linutop rebranded

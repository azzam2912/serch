because it is a variable star it has been given the variable star designation uu piscium 35 piscium is the flamsteed designation this system is faintly visible to the naked eye with a combined apparent visual magnitude of 5 88 it is catalogued as a member of the ic 2391 supercluster by olin j eggen in the past the inner pair designated component a has been described as an eclipsing binary system showing a primary minimum of 6 05 and a secondary minimum of 6 04 they have an orbital period of 0 841658 days zero eccentricity and an inclination of 19 degrees however bruno cester argued that the apparent eclipses are not real and were caused by seeing different portions of distorted shaped stars in a near contact binary system as of 2017 it is classified as a rotating ellipsoidal variable and possibly a w ursae majoris type system although not in physical contact the components of this pair appear to be equal with stellar classifications of f0 v or f0 iv the magnitude 7 72 tertiary member designated component b lies at an angular separation of from the main pair

its architecture is the basis for amd s pcnet family of highly integrated single chip ethernet controllers the one exception is the am79c940 mac the am7990 chip was fabricated in nmos technology and has no integrated manchester encoder decoder endec nor does it have an integrated 10base t transceiver a later refabricated chip called the c lance am79c90 is made with 0 8 micrometre cmos technology the original nmos version am7990 and the cmos am79c90 version are differ in some details which may affect device driver compatibility the datasheet for the cmos version writes that the cmos and nmos versions are the same but the table b 1 comparison summary of the c lance and lance devices in the datasheet shows they differ these differences are not likely to require modifications of any device driver the pcnet family of ethernet controllers pcnet isa ii pcnet 32 pcnet pci ii and pcnet fast is lance software compatible this means you should be able use the original 16 bit software on these members of the pcnet family of single chip ethernet controllers the am7990 can handle 10base 5 type a 10base 2 type b and 10base t back to back packet reception

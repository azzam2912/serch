it forms the boundary between the kruger national park to the south and the makuleke concession to the north it was carved by the luvuvhu river and is at some points more than 150m deep lanner gorge is approximately 11 km long and is carved into sandstones and shales the uppermost rocks are gravels which are thought to be cretaceous in age while the basal shales are thought to be permian in age the majority of the walls appear to be composed of triassic and jurassic aged sandstones formed under arid conditions the luvuvhu river has eroded through the sandstones and shales and formation is still active as is evidenced by the many collapsed boulders in the river bed dinosaur fossils have been discovered in the walls of lanner gorge and rocks in the surrounding region desert roses are also common in the triassic and jurassic aged rocks the precise geological age of the gorge is unknown however the absence of early stone age occupation in the many caves and shelters in the gorge suggests that the gorge may be relatively young and have formed in the last 2 million years as the luvuvhu river is still a young active

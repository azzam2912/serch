luminous flux differs from power radiant flux in that radiant flux includes all electromagnetic waves emitted while luminous flux is weighted according to a model a luminosity function of the human eye s sensitivity to various wavelengths lumens are related to lux in that one lux is one lumen per square meter the lumen is defined in relation to the candela as a full sphere has a solid angle of 4 steradians so a light source that uniformly radiates one candela in all directions has a total luminous flux of if a light source emits one candela of luminous intensity uniformly across a solid angle of one steradian the total luminous flux emitted into that angle is one lumen 1 cd 1 sr 1 lm alternatively an isotropic one candela light source emits a total luminous flux of exactly 4 lumens if the source were partly covered by an ideal absorbing hemisphere that system would radiate half as much luminous flux only 2 lumens the luminous intensity would still be one candela in those directions that are not obscured the lumen can be thought of casually as a measure of the total amount of visible light in some defined beam

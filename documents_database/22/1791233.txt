condenser or isolation condenser system is in a reactor core isolation cooling system rcic one of the emergency reactor safety systems in some nuclear plants boiling water reactor safety systems it is a passive system for cooling of some reactors bwr 2 bwr 3 and the e sbwr series in nuclear production located above containment in a pool of water open to atmosphere in operation decay heat boils steam which is drawn into the heat exchanger and condensed then it falls by weight of gravity back into the reactor this process keeps the cooling water in the reactor making it unnecessary to use powered feedwater pumps the water in the open pool slowly boils off venting clean steam to the atmosphere this makes it unnecessary to run mechanical systems to remove heat periodically the pool must be refilled a simple task for a fire truck the e sbwr reactors provide three days supply of water in the pool some older reactors also have ic systems including fukushima dai ichi reactor 1 however their water pools may not be as large under normal conditions the ic system is not activated but the top of the ic condenser is connected to the

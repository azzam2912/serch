this is a labeling for simple graphs in which no two distinct edges connect the same two distinct vertices no edge connects a vertex to itself and the graph is connected edge graceful labelings were first introduced by sheng ping lo in his seminal paper given a graph g we denote the set of edges by formula 1 and the vertices by formula 2 let q be the cardinality of formula 1 and p be that of formula 2 once a labeling of the edges is given a vertex u of the graph is labeled by the sum of the labels of the edges incident to it modulo p or in symbols the induced labeling on the vertex u is given by where v u is the label for the vertex and e e is the assigned value of an edge incident to u the problem is to find a labeling for the edges such that all the labels from 1 to q are used once and the induced labels on the vertices run from 0 to formula 6 in other words the resulting set for labels of the edges should be formula 7 and formula 8 for the vertices

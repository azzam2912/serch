the formula was also derived in the same year by the german mathematician karl georg christian von staudt denote the area of the quadrilateral by then we have therefore the law of cosines implies that because both sides equal the square of the length of the diagonal this can be rewritten as adding this to the above formula for yields note that formula 9 a trigonometric identity true for all formula 10 following the same steps as in brahmagupta s formula this can be written as introducing the semiperimeter the above becomes and bretschneider s formula follows after taking the square root of both sides bretschneider s formula generalizes brahmagupta s formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral which in turn generalizes heron s formula for the area of a triangle the trigonometric adjustment in bretschneider s formula for non cyclicality of the quadrilateral can be rewritten non trigonometrically in terms of the sides and the diagonals and to give

it is one of the oxocarbon anions which consist solely of carbon and oxygen its molecular structure can be viewed as two carbonate anions joined so as to form a peroxide bridge o o the anion is formed together with peroxocarbonate at the negative electrode during electrolysis of molten lithium carbonate the anion can also be obtained by electrolysis of a saturated solution of rubidium carbonate in water potassium peroxydicarbonate kco was obtained by constam and von hansen in 1895 its crystal structure was determined only in 2002 it too can be obtained by electrolysis of a saturated potassium carbonate solution at 20 c it is a light blue crystalline solid that decomposes at 141 c releasing oxygen and carbon dioxide and decomposes slowly at lower temperatures rubidium peroxodicarbonate is a light blue crystalline solid that decomposes at its structure was published in 2003 in both salts each of the two carbonate units is planar in the rubidium salt the whole molecule is planar whereas in the potassium salt the two units lie on different and nearly perpendicular planes both of which contain the o o bond

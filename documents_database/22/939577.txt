a set of 103 hexanucleotides known as fas hex3 has been shown to be abundant in ess regions esss inhibit or silence splicing of the pre mrna and contribute to constitutive and alternate splicing to elicit the silencing affect esss recruit proteins that will negatively affect the core splicing machinery exonic splicing silencers work by inhibiting the splicing of pre mrna strands or promoting exon skipping the single stranded pre mrna molecules need to have their intronic and exonic regions spliced in order to be translated esss silence splice sites adjacent to them by interfering with the components of the core splicing complex such as the snrnp s u1 and u2 this causes proteins that negatively influence splicing to be recruited to the splicing machinery esss have four general roles myotonic dystrophy md is most noticeably caused by inheriting an unstable ctg triplet expansion in the dmpk gene in healthy genotypes two isoforms of an insulin receptor mrna transcript exist the isoform ir a lacks exon 11 and is expressed ubiquitously in cells isoform ir b contains exon 11 and is expressed in cells of the liver muscles kidney and adipocytes in individuals with md ir a is upregulated in

it is called an inversion because in many familiar and commonly encountered physical systems this is not possible this concept is of fundamental importance in laser science because the production of a population inversion is a necessary step in the workings of a standard laser to understand the concept of a population inversion it is necessary to understand some thermodynamics and the way that light interacts with matter to do so it is useful to consider a very simple assembly of atoms forming a laser medium assume there are a group of n atoms each of which is capable of being in one of two energy states either the number of these atoms which are in the ground state is given by n and the number in the excited state n since there are n atoms in total the energy difference between the two states given by determines the characteristic frequency formula 3 of light which will interact with the atoms this is given by the relation h being planck s constant if the group of atoms is in thermal equilibrium it can be shown from maxwell boltzmann statistics that the ratio of the number of atoms in each state

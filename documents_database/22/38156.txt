a critical feature of the technique is a middle step that breaks the problem into solvable and perturbation parts perturbation theory is applicable if the problem at hand cannot be solved exactly but can be formulated by adding a small term to the mathematical description of the exactly solvable problem perturbation theory leads to an expression for the desired solution in terms of a formal power series in some small parameter known as a perturbation series that quantifies the deviation from the exactly solvable problem the leading term in this power series is the solution of the exactly solvable problem while further terms describe the deviation in the solution due to the deviation from the initial problem formally we have for the approximation to the full solution a series in the small parameter here called like the following in this example would be the known solution to the exactly solvable initial problem and represent the higher order terms which may be found iteratively by some systematic procedure for small these higher order terms in the series become successively smaller an approximate perturbation solution is obtained by truncating the series usually by keeping only the first two terms the initial solution

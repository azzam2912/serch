it is related to the beta and gamma cyclodextrins which contain seven and eight glucose units respectively all cyclodextrins are white water soluble solids with minimal toxicity cyclodextrins tend to bind other molecules in their quasi cylindrical interiors this inclusion and release behavior leads to applications in medicine the compound is of wide interest because it exhibits host guest properties forming inclusion compounds in cyclodextrin the six glucose subunits are linked end to end via 1 4 linkages the result has the shape of a tapered cylinder with six primary alcohols on one face and twelve secondary alcohol groups on the other the exterior surface of cyclodextrins is somewhat hydrophilic whereas the interior core is hydrophobic cyclodextrin is marketed for a range of medical healthcare and food and beverage applications for drug delivery this cyclodextrin confers aqueous solubility to hydrophobic drugs and stability to labile drugs cyclodextrins are natural starch conversion products for industrial use they are manufactured by enzymatic degradation from vegetable raw materials such as corn or potatoes first the starch is liquified either by heat treatment or using amylase then cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase cgtase is added for enzymatic conversion cgtases produce diverse cyclodextrins the selectivity of the synthesis

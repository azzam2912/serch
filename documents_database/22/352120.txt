using technology substantially similar to concepts developed in the mach kernel spring concentrated on providing a richer programming environment supporting multiple inheritance and other features spring was also more cleanly separated from the operating systems it would host divorcing it from its unix roots and even allowing several oses to be run at the same time development faded out in the mid 1990s but several ideas and some code from the project was later re used in the java programming language libraries and the solaris operating system spring started in a roundabout fashion in 1987 as part of sun and at t s collaboration to create a merged unix both companies decided it was also a good opportunity to reimplement unix in an object oriented fashion however after only a few meetings this part of the project died sun decided to keep their team together and instead explore a system on the leading edge in addition to combining unix flavours the new system would also be able to run just about any other system as well and do so in a distributed fashion the system was first running in a complete fashion in 1993 and produced a series of research

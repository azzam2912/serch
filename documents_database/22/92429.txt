it derives its name from its enormous shoe shaped bill it has a somewhat stork like overall form and has previously been classified with the storks in the order ciconiiformes based on this morphology however genetic evidence places it with the pelecaniformes the adult is mainly grey while the juveniles are browner it lives in tropical east africa in large swamps from sudan to zambia the shoebill was known to both ancient egyptians and arabs but was not classified until the 19th century after skins and eventually live specimens were brought to europe john gould described it in 1850 giving it the name balaeniceps rex the genus name comes from the latin words balaena whale and caput head abbreviated to ceps in compound words traditionally allied with the storks ciconiiformes it was retained there in the sibley ahlquist taxonomy which lumped a massive number of unrelated taxa into their ciconiiformes more recently the shoebill has been considered to be closer to the pelicans based on anatomical comparisons or the herons based on biochemical evidence hagey et al 2002 microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by konstantin mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of shoebills closely resembled those of other pelecaniformes

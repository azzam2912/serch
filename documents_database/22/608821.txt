see the entry on indexed sets for more detail the binary relation r on the set is defined so that arb holds if and only if a divides b evenly with no remainder for example 2 r 4 holds because 2 divides 4 without leaving a remainder but 3 r 4 does not hold because when 3 divides 4 there is a remainder of 1 the following set is the set of pairs for which the relation r holds the corresponding representation as a logical matrix is the matrix representation of the equality relation on a finite set is the identity matrix i that is the matrix whose entries on the diagonal are all 1 while the others are all 0 more generally if relation r satisfies i r then r is a reflexive relation if the boolean domain is viewed as a semiring where addition corresponds to logical or and multiplication to logical and the matrix representation of the composition of two relations is equal to the matrix product of the matrix representations of these relations this product can be computed in expected time o n frequently operations on binary matrices are defined in terms of modular arithmetic mod

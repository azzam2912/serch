blowing houses contained a furnace and a pair of bellows that were powered by an adjacent water wheel and they were in use from the early 14th century until they were gradually replaced by reverberatory furnaces in the 18th century the remains of over 40 blowing houses have been identified on dartmoor the blowing house method of smelting tin was probably introduced early in the 14th century to replace the earliest method of smelting which had to be done in two stages a first smelting probably took place near to the tinworks and the roughly smelted metal was taken to a stannary town to be smelted again to produce the final refined product each of these smeltings was taxed separately until 1303 when they were replaced by a single tax on the finished product it is likely that this tax change was due to the improved smelting process provided by the blowing houses documentation confirms the existence of blowing houses in cornwall as early as 1402 but the earliest reference for dartmoor is not found until the early 16th century though it is likely that they were in use on the moor earlier in devon there are many references to

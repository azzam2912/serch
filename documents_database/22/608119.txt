it drywasher operates by the use of air by forcing air to flow up through the material as it moves down the sluice the heavier materials like gold will stay at the bottom and get trapped by the riffles while the lighter materials will flow up and over the riffles or be blown away the lighter material that is not blown away will slowly flow down the sluice and fall out the end of the sluice drywasher a mechanical apparatus used for separating free particles of placer gold from dry sediments dry placers represent a major portion of all alluvial gold deposits around the globe extreme aridity in southern hemispheric regions of the planet causes a slower rate of erosion on placer deposits than if rainfall were plentiful and regional watersheds were hydrologically active this absence of water directly correlates to the low moisture content of alluvial sediments and the short distance gold moves from its hardrock source a drywasher works on the principle of gravity separation since gold at 19 1 specific gravity is much heavier than most other minerals found in local sediments a facsimile of certain natural conditions which would involve the use of water if it

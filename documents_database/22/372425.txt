what the exponential dichotomy says is that the norm of the projection onto the stable subspace of any orbit in the system decays exponentially as t and the norm of the projection onto the unstable subspace of any orbit decays exponentially as t and furthermore that the stable and unstable subspaces are conjugate because formula 4 an equilibrium point with an exponential dichotomy has many of the properties of a hyperbolic equilibrium point in autonomous systems in fact it can be shown that a hyperbolic point has an exponential dichotomy

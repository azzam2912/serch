it was somewhat effective in clinical trials but less so than conventional drugs against hypertension elevated blood pressure angiotensin ii causes blood vessels to constrict and drives blood pressure up cyt006 angqb consists of virus like particles covalently coupled to angiotensin ii subcutaneous injection causes the immune system to produce antibodies which reduce angiotensin ii blood levels lowering blood pressure in a 2008 phase iia study 72 patients received 100 g 300 g or placebo in weeks 0 4 and 12 blood pressure was lowered dose dependently by 5 6 mmhg systolic and 2 8 mmhg diastolic in the 300 g group morning blood pressure 5 00 8 00 was lowered by 25 mmhg systolic and 13 mmhg diastolic side effects were mild and included local reactions headache and fatigue the 2008 trial was small and exploratory it did not address the question of whether the vaccine actually protects internal organs nor did it address safety concerns such as whether the vaccine would cause autoimmune disease if a standard drug treatment is found to dangerously inhibit the renin angiotensin aldosterone system it can be withdrawn and the effects reversed quickly but that would not be true of the vaccine however

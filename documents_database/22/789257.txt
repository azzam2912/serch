the key component of any indeterministic procedure is the evaluation of a position since it is impossible to devise a deterministic chain linking the inter mediate state with the outcome of the game the most complex component of any indeterministic method is assessing these intermediate stages it is precisely the function of predispositions to assess the impact of an intermediate state upon the future course of development according to aron katsenelinboigen calculus of predispositions is another method of computing probability both methods may lead to the same results and thus can be interchangeable however it is not always possible to interchange them since computing via frequencies requires availability of statistics possibility to gather the data as well as having the knowledge of the extent to which one can interlink the system s constituent elements also no statistics can be obtained on unique events and naturally in such cases the calculus of predispositions becomes the only option the procedure of calculating predispositions is linked to two steps dissection of the system on its constituent elements and integration of the analyzed parts in a new whole according to katsenelinboigen the system is structured by two basic types of parameters material and positional

lightning that hits a power line can give many thousands sometimes 100 000 or more volts a motor when switched off can generate a spike of 1 000 or more volts spikes can degrade wiring insulation and destroy electronic devices like battery chargers modems and tvs spikes can also occur on telephone and data lines when ac alternating current main lines accidentally connect to them or lightning hits them or the telephone and data lines travel near lines with a spike and the voltage is induced a long term surge lasting seconds minutes or hours caused by power transformer failures such as a lost neutral or other power company error are not protected by transient protectors long term surges can destroy the protectors in an entire building or area even tens of milliseconds can be longer than a protector can handle long term surges may or may not be handled by fuses and over voltage relays a transient surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting current to reduce the voltage below a safe threshold blocking is done by using inductors which inhibit a sudden change in current shorting is done

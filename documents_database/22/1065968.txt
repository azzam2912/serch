it featured a number of important innovations chapman would use on later models to better use the power of the coventry climax engine it was designed as usual for low weight and low drag relying on a space frame it placed the driver as low as possible reducing the height of transmission tunnel by way of a conceptually brilliant five speed sequential shift transaxle located in the back this transaxle was designed by richard ansdale and harry mundy the gearbox had a long undiagnosed oil starvation problem thus earned the nickname queerbox for its unreliability although the first two examples of lotus 12 had de dion rear suspension it also introduced a new suspension configuration with what came to be called chapman struts in the rear essentially a macpherson strut with a fixed length halfshaft with universal joints on the ends utilised as a suspension arm lotus 12 was the first lotus to be fitted with the iconic wobbly web wheels reflecting chapman s emphasis on engineering for lightness these were cast in magnesium alloy a kind of crimped cylinder resulting in minimum material and maximum strength without the weaknesses induced by slots in conventional designs despite its engineering advances

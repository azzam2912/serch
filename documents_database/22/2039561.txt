it can have many causes the performance gap is mainly due to uncertainties uncertainties are found in any real world system and buildings are no exception as early as 1978 gero and dudnik wrote a paper presenting a methodology to solve the problem of designing subsystems hvac subjected to uncertain demands after that other authors have shown an interest in the uncertainties that are present in building design uncertainties in building design construction can be classified into three groups the type 1 from this grouping have been divided here into two main groups one concerning the uncertainty due to climate change and the other concerning uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files concerning the uncertainties due to climate change buildings have long life spans for example in england and wales around 40 of the office blocks existing in 2004 were built before 1940 30 if considered by floor area and 38 9 of english dwellings in 2007 were built before 1944 this long life span makes buildings likely to operate with climates that might change due to global warming de wilde and coley showed how important is to design buildings that take into consideration climate change and

the end result is a condensate of particles that fills the volume of the system tachyon condensation is closely related to second order phase transitions tachyon condensation is a process in which a tachyonic field usually a scalar field with a complex mass acquires a vacuum expectation value and reaches the minimum of the potential energy while the field is tachyonic and unstable near the local maximum of the potential the field gets a non negative squared mass and becomes stable near the minimum the appearance of tachyons is a potentially serious problem for any theory examples of tachyonic fields amenable to condensation are all cases of spontaneous symmetry breaking in condensed matter physics a notable example is ferromagnetism in particle physics the best known example is the higgs mechanism in the standard model that breaks the electroweak symmetry although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass the mass is not quantized rather the scalar field is even for tachyonic quantum fields the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute or anticommute thus preserving causality therefore information still does not propagate faster than light and solutions

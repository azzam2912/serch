whereas the method of least squares results in estimates of the conditional mean of the response variable given certain values of the predictor variables quantile regression aims at estimating either the conditional median or other quantiles of the response variable essentially quantile regression is the extension of linear regression and we use it when the conditions of linear regression are not applicable quantile regression is desired if conditional quantile functions are of interest one advantage of quantile regression relative to the ordinary least squares regression is that the quantile regression estimates are more robust against outliers in the response measurements however the main attraction of quantile regression goes beyond that different measures of central tendency and statistical dispersion can be useful to obtain a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between variables in ecology quantile regression has been proposed and used as a way to discover more useful predictive relationships between variables in cases where there is no relationship or only a weak relationship between the means of such variables the need for and success of quantile regression in ecology has been attributed to the complexity of interactions between different factors leading to data with unequal variation of one variable

if launched luvoir would be a replacement and successor for the hst with the ability to obtain spectroscopic and imaging observations of astronomical objects in the ultraviolet optical and infrared wavelengths but with substantially better resolution than either hst or the yet to be launched james webb space telescope jwst like jwst atlast would be deployed at the sun earth lagrange point the hdst luvoir a and atlast luvoir b are two competing versions to become luvoir managed by nasa s large strategic science missions program luvoir is envisioned as a flagship mission of the 2025 2035 period designed to determine whether there is life elsewhere in the galaxy it would attempt to accomplish this by searching for biosignatures such as molecular oxygen ozone water and methane in the spectra of terrestrial exoplanets the backronym that the early project used atlast was in fact a pun it refers to the time taken to decide on a true visible light successor for the hubble space telescope luvoir is one of four large astrophysics space mission concepts being studied in preparation for the national academy of sciences 2020 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey the other three concepts being habitable exoplanet imaging mission

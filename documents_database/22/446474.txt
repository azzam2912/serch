reciprocity is closely related to the concept of hermitian operators from linear algebra applied to electromagnetism perhaps the most common and general such theorem is lorentz reciprocity and its various special cases such as rayleigh carson reciprocity named after work by hendrik lorentz in 1896 following analogous results regarding sound by lord rayleigh and light by helmholtz potton 2004 loosely it states that the relationship between an oscillating current and the resulting electric field is unchanged if one interchanges the points where the current is placed and where the field is measured for the specific case of an electrical network it is sometimes phrased as the statement that voltages and currents at different points in the network can be interchanged more technically it follows that the mutual impedance of a first circuit due to a second is the same as the mutual impedance of the second circuit due to the first reciprocity is useful in optics which apart from quantum effects can be expressed in terms of classical electromagnetism but also in terms of radiometry there is also an analogous theorem in electrostatics known as green s reciprocity relating the interchange of electric potential and electric charge density forms of

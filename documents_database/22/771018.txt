this simulation can either be extremely accurate as is the case in an application like radiance which attempts to track the energy flow of light interacting with materials using radiosity computational techniques alternatively the simulation can simply be inspired by light physics as is the case with non photorealistic rendering in both cases a shading model is used to describe how surfaces respond to light between these two extremes there are many different rendering approaches which can be employed to achieve almost any desired visual result in order to compute the color of a specific surface pixel an illumination model must be used one of the most common shading models is the phong model the phong model assumes that the intensity of each pixel is the sum of the intensity due to diffuse specular and ambient lighting ambient light is the directionless light of a scene diffuse light comes from a specific source in the scene and is reflected in all directions specular light comes from a specific source and is sent in a specific direction a variety of algorithms exist to simulate lighting some produce realistic results at the cost of efficiency but many are designed to be as

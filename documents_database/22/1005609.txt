this condition can be esophoria where the eyes tend to cross inward in the absence of fusion exophoria in which they diverge or hyperphoria in which one eye points up or down relative to the other phorias are known as latent squint because the tendency of the eyes to deviate is kept latent by fusion a person with two normal eyes has single vision usually because of the combined use of the sensory and motor systems the motor system acts to point both eyes at the target of interest any offset is detected visually and the motor system corrects it heterophoria only occurs during dissociation of the left eye and right eye when fusion of the eyes is absent if you cover one eye e g with your hand you remove the sensory information about the eye s position in the orbit without this there is no stimulus to binocular fusion and the eye will move to a position of rest the difference between this position and where it would be were the eye uncovered is the heterophoria the opposite of heterophoria where the eyes are straight when relaxed and not fusing is called orthophoria in contrast fixation disparity is

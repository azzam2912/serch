its spectrum s the closed maximal ideals contains d as an open subspace because for each z in d there is a maximal ideal consisting of functions f with the subspace d cannot make up the entire spectrum s essentially because the spectrum is a compact space and d is not the complement of the closure of d in s was called the corona by and the corona theorem states that the corona is empty or in other words the open unit disc d is dense in the spectrum a more elementary formulation is that elements f f generate the unit ideal of h if and only if there is some 0 such that newman showed that the corona theorem can be reduced to an interpolation problem which was then proved by carleson in 1979 thomas wolff gave a simplified but unpublished proof of the corona theorem described in and cole later showed that this result cannot be extended to all open riemann surfaces as a by product of carleson s work the carleson measure was invented which itself is a very useful tool in modern function theory it remains an open question whether there are versions of the corona

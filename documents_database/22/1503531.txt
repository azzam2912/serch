it was named after its inventor professor henry selby hele shaw who was noted for his work in viscosity and flows through small gaps between parallel plates the clutch was innovative in not relying upon friction as other clutches did the clutch appears outwardly similar to most other multi plate clutches a stack of plates is enclosed in a housing with a divided central shaft alternate plates are keyed to either the input or output shafts through either the inner or outer housings a pressure plate is arranged at one end of the stack so that an axial force may be applied compressing the stack and causing it to transmit the drive releasing the pressure releases the clutch in the hele shaw clutch the many plates are lightweight pressings from thin sheets of steel each plate has a ring pressed into it v shaped in section and forming a frustum of a cone with each side the clutch is always used wet so that there is a very thin layer of oil between the plates even when compressed for high powers there may be a great many of these plates necessitated by the driving torque through of the keying teeth

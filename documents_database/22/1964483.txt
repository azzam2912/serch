this group of proteins is characterized by a polybasic proteolytic processing site that is cleaved to produce a mature protein containing seven conserved cysteine residues members of this family are regulators of cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues studies in yeast suggest that the encoded protein is involved in aging this protein is transcribed from a monocistronic mrna as well as a bicistronic mrna which also encodes growth differentiation factor 1 ceramide synthase 1 cers1 is a ceramide synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of c18 ceramide in a fumonisin b1 independent manner and is primarily expressed in the brain it can also be found in low levels in skeletal muscle and the testis within the cell cers1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum er and golgi apparatus membrane cers1 has two isoforms and isoform 1 may recycle from the golgi to the er cers1 gdf1 mrna is strongly expressed in muscle and brain and was also found in heart and lung within the brain cers1 is the primary cers expressed in most neurons in white matter it can only be found in low levels in a recent experiment performed in mice in 2012 ablation of neuronal

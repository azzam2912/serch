schwann cells show high expression of pmp22 where it can constitute 2 5 of total protein content in compact myelin compact myelin is the bulk of the peripheral neuron s myelin sheath a protective fatty layer that provides electrical insulation for the neuronal axon the level of pmp22 expression is relatively low in the central nervous system of adults like other membrane proteins newly translated pmp22 protein is temporarily sequestered to the endoplasmic reticulum er and golgi apparatus for post translational modifications pmp22 protein is glycosylated with an n terminus linked sugar and co localized with the chaperone protein calnexin in the er after the protein is transported to the golgi apparatus it can then become incorporated in the plasma membrane of the cell in humans the pmp22 gene is located on chromosome 17p11 2 and spans approximately 40kb the gene contains six exons conserved in both humans and rodents two of which are 5 untranslated exons 1a and 1b and result in two different rna transcripts with identical coding sequences the two transcripts differ in their 5 untranslated regions and have their own promoter regulating expression the remaining exons 2 to 5 include the coding region of the pmp22

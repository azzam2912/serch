the aim of this article is to define the notion in terms of abstract algebraic geometry and to describe some basic uses of projective space let k be an algebraically closed field and v be a finite dimensional vector space over k the symmetric algebra of the dual vector space v is called the polynomial ring on v and denoted by k v it is a naturally graded algebra by the degree of polynomials the projective nullstellensatz states that for any homogeneous ideal i that does not contain all polynomials of a certain degree referred to as an irrelevant ideal the common zero locus of all polynomials in i or nullstelle is non trivial i e the common zero locus contains more than the single element 0 and more precisely the ideal of polynomials that vanish on that locus coincides with the radical of the ideal i this last assertion is best summarized by the formula for any relevant ideal i in particular maximal homogeneous relevant ideals of k v are one to one with lines through the origin of v let v be a finite dimensional vector space over a field k the scheme over k defined by proj

it is titled functional safety of electrical electronic programmable electronic safety related systems e e pe or e e pes iec 61508 is a basic functional safety standard applicable to all kinds of industry it defines functional safety as part of the overall safety relating to the euc equipment under control and the euc control system which depends on the correct functioning of the e e pe safety related systems other technology safety related systems and external risk reduction facilities the fundamental concept is that any safety related system must work correctly or fail in a predictable safe way the standard has two fundamental principles the safety life cycle has 16 phases which roughly can be divided into three groups as follows all phases are concerned with the safety function of the system the standard has seven parts central to the standard are the concepts of probabilistic risk for each safety function the risk is a function of frequency or likelihood of the hazardous event and the event consequence severity the risk is reduced to a tolerable level by applying safety functions which may consist of e e pes associated mechanical devices or other technologies many requirements apply to all

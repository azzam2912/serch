thus they can also be considered minimalist computer programming languages or turing tarpits esoteric programming languages designed to be as small as possible but still turing complete both systems use only two symbols and involve only two operations both were created by professor of linguistics chris barker in 2001 zot 2002 is a successor to iota that supports input and output chris barker s universal iota combinator has the very simple f fsk structure defined here using denotational semantics in terms of the lambda calculus from this one can recover the usual ski expressions thus because of its minimalism it has influenced research concerning chaitin s constant iota is the ll 1 language that prefix orders trees of the aforementioned universal iota combinator leafs consed by function application so that for example denotes formula 1 whereas denotes formula 2 jot is the regular language consisting of all sequences of 0 and 1 the semantics is given by translation to ski expressions the empty string denotes formula 3 formula 4 denotes formula 5 where formula 6 is the translation of formula 7 and formula 8 denotes formula 9 the point of the formula 8 case is that the translation satisfies formula

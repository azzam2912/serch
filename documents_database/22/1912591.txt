this large class of methods in numerical analysis encompass multistage runge kutta methods that use intermediate collocation points as well as linear multistep methods that save a finite time history of the solution john c butcher originally coined this term for these methods and has written a series of review papers a book chapter and a textbook on the topic his collaborator zdzislaw jackiewicz also has an extensive textbook on the topic the original class of methods were originally proposed by butcher 1965 gear 1965 and gragg and stetter 1964 numerical methods for first order ordinary differential equations approximate solutions to initial value problems of the form the result is approximations for the value of formula 2 at discrete times formula 3 where h is the time step sometimes referred to as formula 5 we follow butcher 2006 pps 189 190 for our description although we note that this method can be found elsewhere general linear methods make use of two integers formula 6 the number of time points in history and formula 7 the number of collocation points in the case of formula 8 these methods reduce to classical runge kutta methods and in the case of formula 9

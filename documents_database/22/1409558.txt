for example formula 1 formula 2 formula 3 formula 4the intersection of more than two sets can be written as formula 5 which is similar to capital sigma notation for an explanation of the symbols used in this article refer to the table of mathematical symbols the intersection of two sets a and b denoted by is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets and in symbols that is x is an element of the intersection a b if and only if x is both an element of a and an element of b for example intersection is an associative operation that is for any sets a b and c one has a b c a b c intersection is also commutative for any a and b one has a b b a it thus makes sense to talk about intersections of multiple sets the intersection of a b c and d for example is unambiguously written a b c d inside a universe u one may define the complement a of a to be the set of all elements of u not in a now the intersection of a and b may be written

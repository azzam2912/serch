when using languages that are considered verbose the programmer must write a lot of code to accomplish only minor functionality such code is called boilerplate the need for boilerplate can be reduced through high level mechanisms such as metaprogramming which has the computer automatically write the needed boilerplate code or insert it at compile time convention over configuration which provides good default values reducing the need to specify program details in every project and model driven engineering which uses models and model to code generators eliminating the need for boilerplate manual code the term arose from the newspaper business columns and other pieces that were distributed by print syndicates were sent to subscribing newspapers in the form of prepared printing plates because of their resemblance to the metal plates used in the making of boilers they became known as boiler plates and their resulting text boilerplate text as the stories that were distributed by boiler plates were usually fillers rather than serious news the term became synonymous with unoriginal repetitive text a related term is bookkeeping code referring to code that is not part of the business logic but is interleaved with it in order to keep data structures updated

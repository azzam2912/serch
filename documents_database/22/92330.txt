that is the radial velocity is the component of the object s velocity that points in the direction of the radius connecting the point and the object in astronomy the point is usually taken to be the observer on earth so the radial velocity then denotes the speed with which the object moves away from the earth or approaches it for a negative radial velocity in astronomy radial velocity is often measured to the first order of approximation by doppler spectroscopy the quantity obtained by this method may be called the barycentric radial velocity measure or spectroscopic radial velocity however due to relativistic and cosmological effects over the great distances that light typically travels to reach the observer from an astronomical object this measure cannot be accurately transformed to a geometric radial velocity without additional assumptions about the object and the space between it and the observer by contrast astrometric radial velocity is determined by astrometric observations for example a secular change in the annual parallax light from an object with a substantial relative radial velocity at emission will be subject to the doppler effect so the frequency of the light decreases for objects that were receding redshift and increases

for example the integers z form a discrete subgroup of the reals r with the standard metric topology but the rational numbers q do not a discrete group is a topological group g equipped with the discrete topology any group can be given the discrete topology since every map from a discrete space is continuous the topological homomorphisms between discrete groups are exactly the group homomorphisms between the underlying groups hence there is an isomorphism between the category of groups and the category of discrete groups discrete groups can therefore be identified with their underlying non topological groups there are some occasions when a topological group or lie group is usefully endowed with the discrete topology against nature this happens for example in the theory of the bohr compactification and in group cohomology theory of lie groups a discrete isometry group is an isometry group such that for every point of the metric space the set of images of the point under the isometries is a discrete set a discrete symmetry group is a symmetry group that is a discrete isometry group since topological groups are homogeneous one need only look at a single point to determine if the topological

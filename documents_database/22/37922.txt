it is documented in on personal computers slip has been largely replaced by the point to point protocol ppp which is better engineered has more features and does not require its ip address configuration to be set before it is established on microcontrollers however slip is still the preferred way of encapsulating ip packets due to its very small overhead some people refer to the successful and widely used serial line internet protocol as rick adams slip to avoid confusion with other proposed protocols named slip those other protocols include the much more complicated appendix d serial line interface protocol slip modifies a standard tcp ip datagram by slip requires a serial port configuration of 8 data bits no parity and either eia hardware flow control or clocal mode 3 wire null modem uart operation settings slip does not provide error detection being reliant on upper layer protocols for this therefore slip on its own is not satisfactory over an error prone dial up connection it is however still useful for testing operating systems response capabilities under load by looking at flood ping statistics slip escape characters were also required on some modem connections to escape hayes command set allowing

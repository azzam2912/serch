the anhydrous salt is yellow but the more familiar hydrate nicl 6ho is green nickel ii chloride in various forms is the most important source of nickel for chemical synthesis the nickel chlorides are deliquescent absorbing moisture from the air to form a solution nickel salts have been shown to be carcinogenic to the lungs and nasal passages in cases of long term inhalation exposure the largest scale production of nickel chloride involves the extraction with hydrochloric acid of nickel matte and residues obtained from roasting refining nickel containing ores nickel chloride is not usually prepared in the laboratory because it is inexpensive and has a long shelf life heating the hexahydrate in the range 66 133 c gives the yellowish dihydrate nicl 2ho the hydrates convert to the anhydrous form upon heating in thionyl chloride or by heating under a stream of hcl gas simply heating the hydrates does not afford the anhydrous dichloride the dehydration is accompanied by a color change from green to yellow in case one needs a pure compound without presence of cobalt nickel chloride can be obtained cautiously heating hexaamminenickel chloride nicl adopts the cdcl structure in this motif each ni center is coordinated

he described the mechanism of flow liquefaction of the embankment dam as the phenomenon is most often observed in saturated loose low density or uncompacted sandy soils this is because a loose sand has a tendency to compress when a load is applied dense sands by contrast tend to expand in volume or dilate if the soil is saturated by water a condition that often exists when the soil is below the water table or sea level then water fills the gaps between soil grains pore spaces in response to soil compressing the pore water pressure increases and the water attempts to flow out from the soil to zones of low pressure usually upward towards the ground surface however if the loading is rapidly applied and large enough or is repeated many times e g earthquake shaking storm wave loading such that the water does not flow out before the next cycle of load is applied the water pressures may build to the extent that it exceeds the force contact stresses between the grains of soil that keep them in contact these contacts between grains are the means by which the weight from buildings and overlying soil layers is transferred

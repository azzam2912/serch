it is used to measure the timing of cells on virtual channels vcs and or virtual paths vps against bandwidth and jitter limits contained in a traffic contract for the vc or vp to which the cells belong cells that do not conform to the limits given by the traffic contract may then be re timed delayed in traffic shaping or may be dropped discarded or reduced in priority demoted in traffic policing nonconforming cells that are reduced in priority may then be dropped in preference to higher priority cells by downstream components in the network that are experiencing congestion alternatively they may reach their destination vc or vp termination if there is enough capacity for them despite them being excess cells as far as the contract is concerned see priority control the gcra is given as the reference for checking the traffic on connections in the network i e usage network parameter control upc npc at user network interfaces uni or inter network interfaces or network network interfaces ini nni it is also given as the reference for the timing of cells transmitted atm pdu data requests onto an atm network by a network interface card nic in a

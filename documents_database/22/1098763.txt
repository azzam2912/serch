this enzyme is an oxidoreductase specifically a metal dependent alcohol dehydrogenase that plays a role in anaerobic glycerol metabolism and has been isolated from a number of bacteria including enterobacter aerogenes klebsiella aerogenes streptococcus faecalis erwinia aeroidea bacillus megaterium and bacillus stearothermophilus however most studies of glycerol dehydrogenase have been performed in bacillus stearothermophilus b stearothermophilus due to its thermostability and the following structural and functional information will therefore refer primarily to the characterization of the enzyme in this bacterium glycerol dehydrogenase is a homooctamer composed of eight identical monomer subunits made up of a single polypeptide chain of 370 amino acids molecular weight 42 000 da each subunit contains 9 beta sheets and 14 alpha helices within two distinct domains n terminal residues 1 162 and c terminal residues 163 370 the deep cleft formed between these two domains serves as the enzyme s active site this active site consists of one bound metal ion one nad nicotinamide ring binding site and a substrate binding site research into the structure of b stearothermophilus shows that the active site contains a divalent cation zinc ion zn this zinc ion forms tetrahedral dipole interactions between the amino acid residues asp173 his256

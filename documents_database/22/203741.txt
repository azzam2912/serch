11 oh cah results in hypertension due to excessive mineralocorticoid effects it also causes excessive androgen production both before and after birth and can virilize a genetically female fetus or a child of either sex mineralocorticoid manifestations of severe 11 hydroxylase deficient cah can be biphasic changing from deficiency salt wasting in early infancy to excess hypertension in childhood and adult life salt wasting in early infancy does not occur in most cases of 11 oh cah but can occur because of impaired production of aldosterone aggravated by inefficiency of salt conservation in early infancy when it occurs it resembles the salt wasting of severe 21 hydroxylase deficient cah poor weight gain and vomiting in the first weeks of life progress and culminate in life threatening dehydration hyponatremia hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis in the first month despite the inefficient production of aldosterone the more characteristic mineralocorticoid effect of 11 oh cah is hypertension progressive adrenal hyperplasia due to persistent elevation of acth results in extreme overproduction of 11 deoxycorticosterone doc by mid childhood doc is a weak mineralocorticoid but usually reaches high enough levels in this disease to cause effects of mineralocorticoid excess salt retention volume expansion and hypertension because

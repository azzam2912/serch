these events could include dark matter low energy solar neutrinos double beta decay or rare radioactive decay it works by simultaneously measuring both the light pulse and heat pulse generated by a particle interaction within its internal scintillator crystal the device was originally proposed by l gonzalez mestres and d perret gallix lapp in2p3 cnrs in their rapporteur contribution to the proceedings of the xxiv international conference on high energy physics munich august 1988 gonzalez mestres and perret gallix wrote perhaps bolometry should in some cases be combined with other detection techniques luminescence in order to produce a primary fast signal as timing strobe if light is used as a complementary signature particle identification can be achieved through the heat light ratio where nucleus recoil is expected to be less luminescent than ionizing particles the success of such a development would open the way to unprecedented achievements in background rejection for rare event experiments further explanations including a description of the detector and possible applications incorporating in particular bgo and tungstates were given by these authors in other papers such as their contribution to the march 1989 moriond meeting pages 16 18 the luminescent bolometer has since then been developed

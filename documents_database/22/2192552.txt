they occur in the body or on the body surface of a single host species or more often on a limited set of host species in the latter case the suitable host species tend to be taxonomically related sharing similar morphology and physiology recent studies have proposed to discriminate between two different types of evolutionary change in host specificity according to this view host switch can be a sudden and accidental colonization of a new host species by a few parasite individuals capable of establishing a new and viable population there after a switch of this type the new population is more or less isolated from the population on the donor host species the new population does not affect the further fate of the conspecific parasites on the donor host and may finally lead to parasite speciation this type of switch is more likely to target an increasing host population that harbours a relatively poor parasite pathogen fauna such as the pioneer populations of invasive species the switch of hiv to the human host is of this type alternatively in the case of a multi host parasite host shift may occur as a gradual change of the relative role of

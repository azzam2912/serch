it bears certain differences from its descendants which are not always understood and are frequently misquoted this article sets out the original axioms with the original text translated into english and original numbering the axioms of zermelo set theory are stated for objects some of which but not necessarily all are called sets and the remaining objects are urelements and do not contain any elements zermelo s language implicitly includes a membership relation an equality relation if it is not included in the underlying logic and a unary predicate saying whether an object is a set later versions of set theory often assume that all objects are sets so there are no urelements and there is no need for the unary predicate the most widely used and accepted set theory is known as zfc which consists of zermelo fraenkel set theory with the addition of the axiom of choice the links show where the axioms of zermelo s theory correspond there is no exact match for elementary sets it was later shown that the singleton set could be derived from what is now called the axiom of pairs if a exists a and a exist thus a a exists and

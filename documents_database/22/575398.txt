cryoet is a specialized application of transmission electron cryomicroscopy cryotem in which samples are imaged as they are tilted resulting in a series of 2d images that can be combined to produce a 3d reconstruction similar to a ct scan of the human body in contrast to other electron tomography techniques samples are immobilized in non crystalline vitreous ice and imaged under cryogenic conditions electron microscopy em samples are imaged in an ultra high vacuum such a vacuum is incompatible with biological samples such as cells the water would boil off and the difference in pressure would explode the cell in room temperature em techniques samples are therefore prepared by fixation and dehydration another approach to stabilize biological samples however is to freeze them electron cryomicroscopy as in other electron cryomicroscopy techniques samples for cryoet typically small cells e g bacteria archaea or viruses are prepared in standard aqueous media and applied to an em grid the grid is then plunged into a cryogen typically ethane so efficient that water molecules do not have time to rearrange into a crystalline lattice the resulting water state is called vitreous ice and preserves native cellular structures such as lipid membranes that would

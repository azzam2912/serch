the company was based in payerne in western switzerland near payerne air base where it planned to build a spaceport in 2015 suborbital spaceplanes were to be launched from an airbus a300 giving the spacecraft more initial speed and altitude than if it were launched from the ground the spacecraft in turn would release a disposable third stage the company planned to charge chf 10 million us 10 5 million per launch using unmanned suborbital spaceplanes that could carry satellites weighing up to costs were expected to be reduced by the reusable nature of the spaceplane and launch facilities and by somewhat lower fuel consumption than conventional systems in 2013 s3 also hoped to develop a manned version of its suborbital spaceplane to provide supersonic intercontinental flights to paying customers according to ceo pascal jaussi far from wishing to launch into the space tourism market we want rather to establish a new mode of air travel based on our satellite launch model that will allow spaceports on different continents to be reached in an hour project partners included the european space agency dassault aviation and the von karman institute for fluid dynamics according to swiss public broadcasting swiss space systems

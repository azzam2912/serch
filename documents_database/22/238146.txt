it is in the constellation orion where it can be seen in the tip of the hunter s upraised club ori is a g0v star it has a faint companion with a mass estimated at about 15 of the mass of the sun an orbital period of 14 1 years and an estimated stellar class of m6 the companion orbits an average distance of 6 1 au from the primary but has a fairly high orbital eccentricity ranging from 3 3 au out to 8 9 au from the primary because of this red dwarf companion the likelihood of habitable planets in this system is low a necessary condition for the existence of a planet in this system are stable zones where the object can remain in orbit for long intervals for hypothetical planets in a circular orbit around the individual members of this star system this maximum orbital radius is computed to be 1 01 au for the primary and 0 41 au for the secondary note that the orbit of the earth is 1 au from the sun a planet orbiting outside of both stars would need to be at least 18 4 au distant ori is a

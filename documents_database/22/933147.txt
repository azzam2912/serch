the exact function s of these proteins is not yet settled but there is evidence that granins function as pro hormones giving rise to an array of peptide fragments for which autocrine paracrine and endocrine activities have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo the intracellular biochemistry of granins includes binding of ca atp and catecholamines epinephrine norepinephrine within the hormone storage vesicle core there is also evidence that cga and perhaps other granins regulate the biogenesis of dense core secretory vesicles and hormone sequestration in neuroendocrine cells apart from their subcellular location and the abundance of acidic residues asp and glu these proteins do not share many structural similarities only one short region located in the c terminal section is conserved in all these proteins chromogranins and secretogranins together share a c terminal motif whereas chromogranins a and b share a region of high similarity in their n terminal section this region includes two cysteine residues involved in a disulfide bond there are considerable differences in the amino acid composition between different animals commercial assays for measuring human cga can usually not be used for measuring cga in samples from other species some specific parts of the molecule have

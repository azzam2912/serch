the locomotive s electrical drive technology is directly derived from the sncf bb 36000 manufactured by alstom a small class size and reliability problems with correspondingly high per capita maintenance and replacement costs led amtrak to retire all of its hhp 8s after only a decade in service marc is currently refurbishing its hhp 8s with the first locomotives now undergoing successful testing the locomotives have a 6 mj crash energy absorbance structure the carbody is stainless steel the electrical traction system is directly derived from the system used on alstom s bb 36000 astride locomotives this includes four 1 5mw three phase asynchronous traction motors powered by gto based inverters with one inverter per motor the electric system also allows regenerative and rheostatic braking the locomotives were designed for up to operation but are actually limited in service to fra tier 1 standards operating up to amtrak ordered 15 hhp 8s in 1996 at the same time as its acela express trainsets the hhp 8s have external styling that is similar to the acela trainsets but are designed to operate as independent locomotives hauling conventional passenger rolling stock the units supplemented the emd aem 7s and allowed amtrak to

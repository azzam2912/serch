this gene is a member of the caudal related homeobox transcription factor family that is expressed in the nuclei of intestinal epithelial cells cdx2 is the gene that directs early embryogenesis in mice it is required to form the placenta ectopic expression of cdx2 was reported in more than 85 of the human patients with acute myeloid leukemia aml ectopic expression of cdx2 in murine bone marrow induced aml in mice and upregulate hox genes in bone marrow progenitors cdx2 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of barrett s esophagus where it has been shown that components from gastroesophageal reflux such as bile acids are able to induce the expression of an intestinal differentiation program through up regulation of nf b and cdx2 cdx2 is also used in diagnostic surgical pathology as a marker for gastrointestinal differentiation especially colorectal this gene or more specifically the equivalent gene in humans has come up in the proposal by the president s council on bioethics as a solution to the stem cell controversy according to one of the plans put forth by deactivating the gene it would not be possible for a properly organized embryo to form thus providing stem cells without requiring

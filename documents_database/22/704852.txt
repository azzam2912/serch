it was first identified in 1961 in this compound technetium has an oxidation state of 6 the highest oxidation state found in the technetium halides the other such compound is technetium vi chloride tccl in this respect technetium differs from rhenium which forms a heptafluoride ref technetium hexafluoride occurs as an impurity in uranium hexafluoride as technetium is a fission product of uranium technetium hexafluoride is prepared by heating technetium metal with an excess of f at 400 c technetium hexafluoride is a golden yellow solid at room temperature its melting point is 37 4 c and its boiling point is 55 3 c technetium hexafluoride undergoes a solid phase transition at 4 54 c above this temperature measured at 10 c the solid structure is cubic lattice parameters are a 6 16 there are two formula units in this case discrete molecules per unit cell giving a density of 3 02 g cm below this temperature measured at 19 c the solid structure is orthorhombic space group pnma lattice parameters are a 9 55 b 8 74 and c 5 02 there are four formula units in this case discrete molecules per unit cell giving a density of 3

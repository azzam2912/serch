it is due to mutations in the ada2 gene which encodes the adenosine deaminase 2 protein the clinical features of this condition are protean and it may be easily missed the age of onset of symptoms is variable 24 of reported patients present before 1 year of age 77 present before the age 10 years adult onset has also been described 5 10 die from this disease by the age of 30 years like all vasculitis syndromes the features depend on which is organ is involved most commonly the gut kidney and liver are affected it may manifest as lacunar and or hemorrhagic strokes cutaneous lesions or polyarteritis nodosa hypertension and hepatosplenomegaly may occur it may affect the skin livedo reticularis and livedo racemosa or brain stroke polyarteritis nodosa in children is also known to occur other conditions associated with this syndrome include hypogammaglobulinemia pure red cell aplasia immune thrombocytopenia and neutropenia the ada2 gene is located in the long arm of chromosome 22 22q11 1 over 60 pathogenic mutations have been recognised in ada2 in all clinical cases to date both copies of the gene have been mutated implying a recessive inheritance this is not understood the gene is

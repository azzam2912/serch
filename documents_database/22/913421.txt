that is where a consistent heuristic is also admissible i e it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal the converse however is not always true this is proved by induction on formula 3 the length of the best path from node to goal by assumption formula 4 where formula 5 denotes the cost of the shortest path from n to the goal therefore making it admissible formula 7 is any node whose best path to the goal of length m 1 goes through some immediate child formula 8 whose best path to the goal is of length m consistent heuristics are called monotone because the estimated final cost of a partial solution formula 9 is monotonically non decreasing along the best path to the goal where formula 10 is the cost of the best path from start node formula 11 to formula 12 it s necessary and sufficient for a heuristic to obey the triangle inequality in order to be consistent in the a search algorithm using a consistent heuristic means that once a node is expanded the cost by which it was reached is the lowest possible under the same conditions that dijkstra s algorithm requires in

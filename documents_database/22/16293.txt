bch codes were invented in 1959 by french mathematician alexis hocquenghem and independently in 1960 by raj bose and d k ray chaudhuri the name bose chaudhuri hocquenghem and the acronym bch arises from the initials of the inventors surnames mistakenly in the case of ray chaudhuri one of the key features of bch codes is that during code design there is a precise control over the number of symbol errors correctable by the code in particular it is possible to design binary bch codes that can correct multiple bit errors another advantage of bch codes is the ease with which they can be decoded namely via an algebraic method known as syndrome decoding this simplifies the design of the decoder for these codes using small low power electronic hardware bch codes are used in applications such as satellite communications compact disc players dvds disk drives solid state drives and two dimensional bar codes given a prime number and prime power with positive integers and such that a primitive narrow sense bch code over the finite field or galois field with code length and distance at least is constructed by the following method let be a primitive element of for

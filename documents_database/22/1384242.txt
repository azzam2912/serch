it is long and was named after a classical albedo feature name keith harrison and mary chapman described strong evidence for a lake in the eastern part of valles marineris especially in coprates chasma it would have had an average depth of only 842 m much smaller than the 5 10 km depth of parts of valles marineris still its volume of 110 000 cubic miles would be comparable to earth s caspian and black seas the main evidence for such a lake is the presence of benches at the level that models show is where the lake level should be also the low point in eos chasma where water would be expected to overflow is marked by fluvial features the features look like the flow came together at a small point and carried out significant erosion the bottom of the coprates chasma contain a large field of small pitted cones which have been interpreted as martian equivalents of terrestrial igneous or mud volcanoes recurrent slope lineae are small dark streaks on slopes that elongate in warm seasons they may be evidence of liquid water

it had an estimated magnitude of 7 1 this earthquake was one of the most destructive in the epicentral area compared to other events of subduction of the same size the extensive damage to structures was the result of an amplification effect on the ground and the poor quality of building materials this reflects the potential for damage incurred in an intraplate earthquake with vertical fault and how it can be much greater than what which can cause one of interplate of similar magnitude and caused severe damage in chilean cities of la serena ovalle illapel and punitaqui chile lies above the convergent plate boundary where the nazca plate is subducting beneath the south american plate at a location where they converge at a rate of seventy millimeters a year this quake was an oceanic interplate type occurred in the downgoing slab of the nazca plate and not on the interface between the two plates this event took place under the area of chile between 27 and 33 s where the slab is nearly horizontal and there is a high degree of mechanical coupling between the plates the october earthquake occurred in the area of the plate interface that ruptured

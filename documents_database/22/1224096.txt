schemata are a special case of cylinder sets and so form a topological space for example consider binary strings of length 6 the schema 1 0 1 describes the set of all words of length 6 with 1 s at the first and sixth positions and a 0 at the fourth position the is a wildcard symbol which means that positions 2 3 and 5 can have a value of either 1 or 0 the order of a schema is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template while the defining length formula 1 is the distance between the first and last specific positions the order of 1 0 1 is 3 and its defining length is 5 the fitness of a schema is the average fitness of all strings matching the schema the fitness of a string is a measure of the value of the encoded problem solution as computed by a problem specific evaluation function the length of a schema formula 2 called formula 3 is defined as the total number of nodes in the schema formula 3 is also equal to the number of nodes in the programs matching formula 2 if the child of

this very diverse species with its numerous subspecies and morphs has since long posed a taxonomic problem and recent research suggests it is a cryptic species complex that has now been split into several species the tropical boubou is fairly large for its family bushshrikes measuring 23 25 cm in length its weight can vary between about 38 70 g but typically adults weigh between 50 and 60 g females are on average a bit smaller than males but individual variation is so large that for most practical purposes the sexes seem to be of identical size the wing measures about 98 mm on average between 85 and 110 the tail is a mere two millimetres longer both on average and as regards variation the tarsus is c 29 37 mm long 33 mm on average while the bill s exposed culmen measures a little over 20 mm in some populations and as much as 25 mm in others unlike the other measurements where there is mostly individual variation the bill length might distinctly vary between subspecies not only are males and females the same size they have identical plumage too the adults upper parts and tail are glossy blue

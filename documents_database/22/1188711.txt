the hydrogen from the hydroxyl group is lost along with the hydrogen bonded to the second carbon the remaining oxygen then forms double bonds with the carbon this leaves a ketone as r cor ketones cannot normally be oxidised any further because this would involve breaking a c c bond which requires too much energy the reaction can occur using a variety of oxidants a secondary alcohol can be oxidised into a ketone using acidified potassium dichromate and heating under reflux the orange red dichromate ion cro is reduced to the green cr ion this reaction was once used in an alcohol breath test pcc when used in an organic solvent can be used to oxidise a secondary alcohol into a ketone it has the advantage of doing so selectively without the tendency to over oxidise the dess martin periodinane is a mild oxidant for the conversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones the reaction is performed under standard conditions at room temperature most often in dichloromethane the reaction takes between half an hour and two hours to complete the product is then separated from the spent periodinane swern oxidation oxidises secondary alcohols into ketones using oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulfoxide

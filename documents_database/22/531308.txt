powers of two are usually ignored because of the way the human ear perceives octaves an x dimensional tone dimension contains x factors an euler fokker genus with two dimensions may be represented in a two dimensional rectangular tone grid one with three dimensions in a three dimensional block shaped tone lattice euler fokker genera are characterized by a listing of the number of steps in each dimension the number of steps is represented by a repeated mention of the dimension so that there arise descriptions such as 3 3 5 5 3 5 7 3 3 5 5 7 7 11 11 etc for example the multiset 3 3 7 yields the euler fokker genus 3 3 7 which contains these pitches normalized to fall within an octave these become 1 1 9 8 21 16 3 2 7 4 63 32 euler genera are generated from the prime factors 3 and 5 whereas an euler fokker genus can have factors of 7 or any higher prime number the degree is the number of intervals which generate a genus however not all genera of the same degree have the same number of tones since xxxyyy may also be notated

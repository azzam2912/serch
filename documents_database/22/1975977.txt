the actual elements of a game engine that can cause so called netcode issues include among other things latency lag compensation or the lack thereof simulation errors and network issues between the client and server that are completely out of the game s hands netcode as a term tends to be used only in the gaming community as it is not recognized as an actual computer science term latency is an unavoidable fact of online games caused by not only network latency which is largely out of a game s control but also latency inherent in the way game simulations are run there are several lag compensation methods used to disguise reduce or cope with latency however their feasibility varies by application a single update of a game simulation is known as a tick the rate at which the simulation is run on a server is referred often to as the server s tickrate this is essentially the server equivalent of a client s frame rate absent any rendering system tickrate is limited by the length of time it takes to run the simulation and is often intentionally limited further to reduce instability introduced by a fluctuating tickrate and to

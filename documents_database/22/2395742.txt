this is opposed to intrinsic mortality which is the sum of the effects of internal factors such as mutation due to dna replication errors extrinsic mortality plays a significant role in evolutionary theories of aging as well as the discussion of health barriers across socioeconomic borders extrinsic mortality is implicit in both classical theories of aging and non classical studies of aging in both cases its existence causes a selective pressure for either longer lifespans and later reproductive periods or shorter lifespans and earlier reproductive periods classical theories of aging include these classical evolutionary theories of aging postulate that quantities of extrinsic mortality factors should inversely correlate with lifespan in the mutation accumulation theory of aging increased quantities of extrinsic mortality factors prevent selection against the development of random germ line mutations in the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis extrinsic mortality factors prevent selection against pleiotropic genes expressing harmful phenotypes later in life in the disposable soma theory of aging extrinsic mortality factors prevent organisms from selecting mechanisms that encourage long term maintenance however in non classical evolutionary theories of aging this notion is challenged and the opposite is often proven quantities of extrinsic mortality factors correlate with lifespan multiple studies confirm

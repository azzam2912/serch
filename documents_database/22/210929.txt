that is m m n where stands for euler s totient function has no solution for m the cototient of n is defined as n n so a noncototient is a number that is never a cototient it is conjectured that all noncototients are even this follows from a modified form of the slightly stronger version of the goldbach conjecture if the even number n can be represented as a sum of two distinct primes p and q then it is expected that every even number larger than 6 is a sum of two distinct primes so probably no odd number larger than 5 is a noncototient the remaining odd numbers are covered by the observations formula 2 and formula 3 for even numbers it can be shown thus all even numbers n such that n 2 can be written as p 1 q 1 with p q primes are cototients the first few noncototients are the cototient of n are least k such that the cototient of k is n are start with n 0 0 if no such k exists greatest k such that the cototient of k is n are start with n 0 0 if no

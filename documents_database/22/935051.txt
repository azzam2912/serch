the grains actually three dimensional in shape have a thin lenticular shape this microstructure is advantageous over other microstructures because of its chaotic ordering which increases toughness acicular ferrite is formed in the interior of the original austenitic grains by direct nucleation on the inclusions resulting in randomly oriented short ferrite needles with a basket weave appearance acicular ferrite is also characterised by high angle boundaries between the ferrite grains this further reduces the chance of cleavage because these boundaries impede crack propagation in c mn steel weld metals it is reported that nucleation of various ferrite morphologies is aided by non metallic inclusion in particular oxygen rich inclusions of a certain type and size are associated with the intragranular nucleation of acicular ferrite as observed for example by acicular ferrite is a fine widmanst tten constituent which is nucleated by an optimum intragranular dispersion of oxide sulfide silicate particles the interlocking nature of acicular ferrite together with its fine grain size 0 5 to 5 um with aspect ratio from 3 1 to 10 1 provides maximum resistance to crack propagation by cleavage composition control of weld metal is often performed to maximise the volume fraction of acicular ferrite

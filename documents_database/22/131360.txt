it was instruction compatible with their existing z80 and differed primarily in having on chip cache and mmu for a 16 mb address range and also a huge number of new more orthogonal instructions and addressing modes however zilog essentially ignored the z800 in favour of their 32 bit z80000 and the z800 never entered mass production after more than five years had elapsed since it was originally introduced the effort was redubbed the z280 in 1986 an actual product the z280 would ship in 1987 with almost the same design as the z800 but this time implemented in cmos there was no expansion of the register set but the registers and instructions were significantly orthogonalized in order to make them more general purpose and powerful many new 8 bit and 16 bit operations were added and the hl ix and iy registers were upgraded from their rather limited possibilities as accumulators in the z80 to more versatile accumulators in addition to the register operands possible in the z80 they could be used with immediate data direct address register indirect or indexed operands even program counter relative eight bit operations had even more possibilities including stack pointer relative addressing and

with advanced maternal age the number of egg cell that can be successfully recruited for a possible pregnancy declines constituting a major factor in the inverse correlation between age and female fertility while there is no known method for assessing the ovarian reserve of individual women indirect determination of ovarian reserve is important in the treatment of infertility the ovary is generally thought of as an egg bank from which the woman draws during her reproductive life the human ovary contains a population of primordial follicles at 18 22 weeks post conception the female ovary contains its peak number of follicles about 300 000 in the average case but individual peak populations range from 35 000 to 2 5 million the size of the initial ovarian reserve is strongly influenced by genetics also elevated androgen levels during prenatal development have an adverse effect on the early establishment of the ovarian reserve each menstrual cycle one egg cell is released by ovulation in addition the remaining follicles that were recruited towards maturation are lost by atresia few if any egg cells are replenished during the reproductive years however this loss by the menstrual cycle only accounts for approximately up to 10

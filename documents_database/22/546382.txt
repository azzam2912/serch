that is if for a prime q there is no smaller prime p and nonzero integer b such that q p 2 b then q is a stern prime the known stern primes are so for example if we try subtracting from 137 the first few squares doubled in order we get 135 129 119 105 87 65 39 9 none of which are prime that means that 137 is a stern prime on the other hand 139 is not a stern prime since we can express it as 137 2 1 or 131 2 2 etc in fact many primes have more than one such representation given a twin prime the larger prime of the pair has a goldbach representation of p 2 1 if that prime is the largest of a prime quadruplet p 8 then p 2 2 is also valid sloane s lists odd numbers with at least n goldbach representations leonhard euler observed that as numbers get larger they have more representations of the form formula 1 suggesting that there may be a largest number with no such representations i e the above list of stern primes might be not only finite but complete according

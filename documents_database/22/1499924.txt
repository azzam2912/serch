it was originally for industrial dynamics but was soon extended to other applications including population and resource studies and urban planning dynamo was initially developed under the direction of jay wright forrester in the late 1950s by dr phyllis fox alexander l pugh iii grace duren and others at the m i t computation center dynamo was used for the system dynamics simulations of global resource depletion reported in the club of rome s limits to growth but has since fallen into disuse in 1958 forrester unwittingly instigated dynamo s development when he asked an mit staff programmer to compute needed solutions to some equations for a harvard business review paper he was writing about industrial dynamics the programmer richard bennett chose to implement a system simple simulation of industrial management problems with lots of equations that took coded equations as symbolic input and computed solutions simple became the proof of concept for dynamo rather than have a specialist programmer hard code a special purpose solver in a general purpose programming language users could specify a system s equations in a special simulation language and get simulation output from one program execution dynamo was designed to emphasize the following among

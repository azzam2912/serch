plants that are not flowering plants green algae mosses liverworts hornworts ferns and gymnosperms such as conifers also have complex interplays between morphological adaptation and environmental factors in their sexual reproduction the breeding system or how the sperm from one plant fertilizes the ovum of another depends on the reproductive morphology and is the single most important determinant of the genetic structure of nonclonal plant populations christian konrad sprengel 1793 studied the reproduction of flowering plants and for the first time it was understood that the pollination process involved both biotic and abiotic interactions charles darwin s theories of natural selection utilized this work to build his theory of evolution which includes analysis of the coevolution of flowers and their insect pollinators plants have complex lifecycles involving alternation of generations one generation the sporophyte gives rise to the next generation asexually via spores spores may be identical isospores or come in different sizes microspores and megaspores but strictly speaking spores and sporophytes are neither male nor female because they do not produce gametes the alternate generation the gametophyte produces gametes eggs and or sperm a gametophyte can be monoicous bisexual producing both eggs and sperm or dioicous unisexual either female

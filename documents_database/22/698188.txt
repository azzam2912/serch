it is primarily present in steroid producing cells including theca cells and luteal cells in the ovary leydig cells in the testis and cell types in the adrenal cortex cholesterol needs to be transferred from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner membrane where cytochrome p450scc enzyme cyp11a1 cleaves the cholesterol side chain which is the first enzymatic step in all steroid synthesis the aqueous phase between these two membranes cannot be crossed by the lipophilic cholesterol unless certain proteins assist in this process a number of proteins have historically been proposed to facilitate this transfer including sterol carrier protein 2 scp2 steroidogenic activator polypeptide sap peripheral benzodiazepine receptor pbr or translocator protein tspo and star it is now clear that this process is primarily mediated by the action of star the mechanism by which star causes cholesterol movement remains unclear as it appears to act from the outside of the mitochondria and its entry into the mitochondria ends its function various hypotheses have been advanced some involve star transferring cholesterol itself like a shuttle while star may bind cholesterol itself the exorbitant number of cholesterol molecules that the protein transfers would indicate that it would have to act as

drosomycin is induced by infection by the toll signalling pathway while expression in surface epithelia like the respiratory tract is instead controlled by the immune deficiency pathway imd this means that drosomycin alongside other antimicrobial peptides amps such as cecropins diptericin drosocin metchnikowin and attacin serves as a first line defence upon septic injury however drosomycin is also expressed constitutively to a lesser extent in different tissues and throughout development drosomycin is a 44 residue defensin like containing four disulfide bridges these bridges stabilize a structure involving one helix and three sheets owing to these four disulfide bridges drosomycin is resistant to degradation and the action of proteases the cysteine stabilized motif of drosomycin is also found in drosophila defensin some plant defensins drosomycin has greater sequence similarity with these plant defensins up to 40 than with other insect defensins the structure was discovered in 1997 by landon and his colleagues the motif of drosomycin is also found in a scorpion neurotoxin and drosomycin potentiates the action of this neurotoxin on nerve excitation at the nucleotide level drosomycin is a 387 bp long gene drs which lies on m ller element 3l very near six other drosomycin like drsl genes

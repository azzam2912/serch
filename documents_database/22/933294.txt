the biologies of these two species in particular have been thoroughly studied and documented the shells of these snails are mostly rather globular in shape in some genera such as cepaea the shells are brightly colored and patterned the animal is capable of complete retraction within the shell the tail is without a mucous gland or projection the mouth is always provided with a jaw which is striate ribbed sulcate or plicate sometimes composed of several imbricating pieces the radula is composed of many transverse horizontal series of teeth the centrals tricuspidate about the size of the laterals laterals bicuspid or tricuspid with the interior cusp obsolete marginals usually wider than high short with two or three small cusps in the soft parts the most obvious distinction is the lack of a caudal mucous pit and their possessing a sculptured jaw typically there is a distinction in the dentition although in some species the lateral teeth take on a pseudozonitoid appearance even in such cases the extreme marginals in helix remain short and very obtuse this family of snails is defined by the anatomical presence of a diverticulum some genera within this family create and use love darts as part

in fact it is a double j stent on which a balloon is mounted it is connected to a delivery device pusher to introduce it from the bladder into the ureter the system comprises a non return valve device and a pusher with a stylet and two ports the sideport is for injecting contrast agent to inflate the balloon while the straight port is for the guidewire the catheter has a relatively large diameter central lumen and a shaft of 2 mm 6 fr the balloon is in two sections a long narrow section or shaft and a larger cranial bulb the larger cranial bulb prevents distal migration while the longer narrow section maintains the increased diameter of a predilated stricture in the ureter section a guide wire has to be placed in the ureter after dilatation of the ureteric stricture with a high pressure dilatation balloon the guidewire remains in place to bring in the ureteric balloon catheter the balloon is inflated by an injection of contrast medium via sideport of the pusher and remains in situ while the expanded urothelium heals the stylet is used to detach the balloon catheter from the pusher during the healing process urine

this means that the distributions of the estimates become more and more concentrated near the true value of the parameter being estimated so that the probability of the estimator being arbitrarily close to converges to one in practice one constructs an estimator as a function of an available sample of size n and then imagines being able to keep collecting data and expanding the sample ad infinitum in this way one would obtain a sequence of estimates indexed by n and consistency is a property of what occurs as the sample size grows to infinity if the sequence of estimates can be mathematically shown to converge in probability to the true value it is called a consistent estimator otherwise the estimator is said to be inconsistent consistency as defined here is sometimes referred to as weak consistency when we replace convergence in probability with almost sure convergence then the estimator is said to be strongly consistent consistency is related to bias see bias versus consistency formally speaking an estimator t of parameter is said to be consistent if it converges in probability to the true value of the parameter a more rigorous definition takes into account the fact that is

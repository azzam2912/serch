a cell membrane is typically labeled with a fluorescent dye to allow for observation a specific area of this labeled section is then bleached several times using the beam of a confocal laser scanning microscope after each imagining scan bleaching occurs again this occurs several times to ensure that all accessible fluorophores are bleached since unbleached fluorophores are exchanged for bleached fluorophores causing movement through the cell membrane the amount of fluorescence from that region is then measured over a period of time to determine the results of the photobleaching on the cell as a whole before photobleaching can occur cells must be injected with a fluorescent protein often a green fluorescent protein gfp which will allow the targeted proteins to fluoresce and therefore be followed throughout the process then a region of interest must be defined this initial region of interest usually contains the whole cell or several cells in flip photobleaching occurs just outside the region of interest therefore a photobleaching region also needs to be defined a third region the region where measurement will take place needs to be determined as well a number of initial scans need to be made to determine fluorescence before photobleaching these

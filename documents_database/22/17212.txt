it uses a link state routing lsr algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols igps operating within a single autonomous system as it is defined as ospf version 2 in rfc 2328 1998 for ipv4 the updates for ipv6 are specified as ospf version 3 in rfc 5340 2008 ospf supports the classless inter domain routing cidr addressing model ospf is a widely used igp in large enterprise networks is is another lsr based protocol is more common in large service provider networks open shortest path first ospf was designed as an interior gateway protocol igp for use in an autonomous system such as a local area network lan it implements dijkstra s algorithm also known as the shortest path first spf algorithm as a link state routing protocol it was based on the link state algorithm developed for the arpanet in 1980 and the is is routing protocol ospf was first standardised in 1989 as rfc 1131 which is now known as ospf version 1 the development work for ospf prior to its codification as open standard was undertaken largely by the digital equipment corporation which developed its own proprietary decnet protocols routing protocols like ospf

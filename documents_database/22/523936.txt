installed in the trains bogies are superconducting magnets and the guideways contain two sets of metal coils the current levitation system utilizes a series of coils wound into a figure 8 along both walls of the guideway these coils are also cross connected underneath the track as the train accelerates the magnetic fields of its superconducting magnets induce a current into these coils due to the magnetic field induction effect if the train were centered with the coils the electrical potential would be balanced and no currents would be induced however as the train runs on rubber wheels at relatively low speeds the magnetic fields are positioned below the center of the coils causing the electrical potential to no longer be balanced this creates a reactive magnetic field opposing the superconducting magnet s pole in accordance with lenz s law and a pole above that attracts it once the train reaches there is sufficient current flowing to lift the train above the guideway these coils also generate guiding and stabilizing forces because they are cross connected underneath the guideway if the train moves off center currents are induced into the connections that correct its positioning scmaglev also utilizes a linear

to dilute a solution means to add more solvent without the addition of more solute the resulting solution is thoroughly mixed so as to ensure that all parts of the solution are identical the same direct relationship applies to gases and vapors diluted in air for example although thorough mixing of gases and vapors may not be as easily accomplished for example if there are 10 grams of salt the solute dissolved in 1 litre of water the solvent this solution has a certain salt concentration molarity if one adds 1 litre of water to this solution the salt concentration is reduced the diluted solution still contains 10 grams of salt 0 171 moles of nacl mathematically this relationship can be shown by equation where the basic room purge equation is used in industrial hygiene it determines the time required to reduce a known vapor concentration existing in a closed space to a lower vapor concentration the equation can only be applied when the purged volume of vapor or gas is replaced with clean air or gas for example the equation can be used to calculate the time required at a certain ventilation rate to reduce a high carbon monoxide

bioreporters contain two essential genetic elements a promoter gene and a reporter gene the promoter gene is turned on transcribed when the target agent is present in the cell s environment the promoter gene in a normal bacterial cell is linked to other genes that are then likewise transcribed and then translated into proteins that help the cell in either combating or adapting to the agent to which it has been exposed in the case of a bioreporter these genes or portions thereof have been removed and replaced with a reporter gene consequently turning on the promoter gene now causes the reporter gene to be turned on activation of the reporter gene leads to production of reporter proteins that ultimately generate some type of a detectable signal therefore the presence of a signal indicates that the bioreporter has sensed a particular target agent in its environment originally developed for fundamental analysis of factors affecting gene expression bioreporters were early on applied for the detection of environmental contaminants and have since evolved into fields as diverse as medical diagnostics precision agriculture food safety assurance process monitoring and control and bio microelectronic computing their versatility stems from the fact that there exist

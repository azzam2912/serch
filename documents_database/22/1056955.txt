titan is far colder than earth and its surface lacks stable liquid water factors which have led some scientists to consider life there unlikely on the other hand its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds on the surface there are bodies of liquid methane and ethane and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide pre biotic chemistry for living cells different from those on earth in june 2010 scientists analysing data from the cassini huygens mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane producing organisms but may alternatively be due to non living chemical or meteorological processes the cassini huygens mission was not equipped to look directly for micro organisms or to provide a thorough inventory of complex organic compounds titan s consideration as an environment for the study of prebiotic chemistry or potentially exotic life stems in large part due to the diversity of the organic chemistry that occurs in its atmosphere driven by photochemical reactions in its outer layers the following chemicals have been detected in titan

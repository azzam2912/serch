currently there are 12 members from north and central europe with baseline 1 published in march 2017 and baseline 2 published in december 2017 the project documents lay down a system architecture for interlocking systems including standard interfaces for the individual interlocking components that can be used in any of the participating countries the objective is to turn interlockings into modular systems where different parts of one interlocking can be supplied by different manufacturers while maintaining the high safety and reliability levels required of a critical railway safety system eulynx was started in 2014 by the railway infrastructure managers of 6 european countries germany netherlands belgium france luxembourg and great britain this has expanded with time to 12 by including the railway infrastructure managers from finland norway sweden slovenia switzerland and italy the project is meant to standardise railway signalling and control interfaces in order to reduce cost and installation time of signalling equipment eulynx stems from the shorter lifetime of new signalling equipment technology especially of interlockings which are at the core of the railway safety system an interlocking system using mechanical technology could be expected to last up to 80 years but electronic interlocking equipment has a shorter

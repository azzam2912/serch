there has been confusion about the origins of the gaffey name some people believing that the name came from england or scotland and moved to ulster during the ulster plantation and moved again to connacht in the wake of the o donnells this has been disproven as they did not come from donegal nor did they settle in north connacht like other ulster families a poet named o dugan wrote in the topographical poem of a sept called mac gaibhidh describing their location as a land of fruit it was clearly not the west or north of connacht but instead the southern roscommon area it is thought that the gaffeys are descendants of vikings who sailed down the river shannon and settled near the viking town athlone the name mac gaibhidhe comes from the irish mac an gabha which translates to son of the smith irish people called vikings the blacksmiths for their skills at iron work and it is believed that this is where the gaffey name originates there is more confusion to the name gaffey as not all gaffeys are from the original mc gaibhidhe name some small branches of the gaffney family moved from britain to connacht

most of the world s intelligence agencies and many private organizations intercept telephone communications to obtain military economic and political information the price of simple mobile phone surveillance devices has become so low that many individuals can afford to use them advances in technology have made it difficult to determine who is intercepting and recording private communications crypto phones can protect calls from interception by using algorithms to encrypt the signals the phones have a cryptographic chip that handles encryption and decryption two algorithms are programmed into the chip a key exchange algorithm for the key agreement protocol and a symmetric key algorithm for voice encryption for the system to work both users must have crypto phones logged into crypto mode as with other phones the signal is encrypted by gsm but it is also encrypted by the cryptographic chip when the imsi catcher performs a man in the middle attack and disables the gsm encryption the crypto phone encryption remains intact therefore while the signal is still being intercepted it can no longer be decoded and fake sms messages can t be sent as the imsi catcher does not have the correct code at the beginning of the call

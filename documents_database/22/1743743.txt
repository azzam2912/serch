mapping qtls is an important activity that plant breeders and geneticists routinely use to associate potential causal genes with phenotypes of interest family based qtl mapping is a variant of qtl mapping where multiple families are used pedigree information include information about ancestry keeping pedigree records is a centuries old tradition pedigrees can also be verified using gene marker data the method has been discussed in the context of plant breeding populations pedigree records are kept by plants breeders and pedigree based selection is popular in several plant species plant pedigrees are different from that of humans particularly as plant are hermaphroditic an individual can be male or female and mating can be performed in random combinations with inbreeding loops also plant pedigrees may contain of selfs i e cloned offspring resulting from self pollination of a plant simple cross symbol example the idea of family based qtl mapping comes from inheritance of marker alleles and its association with trait of interest has demonstrated how to use family based association in plant breeding families traditional mapping populations include single family consisting of crossing between two parents or three parents often distantly related there are some important limitations associated with traditional

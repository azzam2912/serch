trifluoromethylated compounds are of some importance in pharmaceutical industry and agrochemicals several notable pharmaceutical compounds have a trifluoromethyl group incorporated fluoxetine mefloquine leflunomide nulitamide dutasteride bicalutamide aprepitant celecoxib fipronil fluazinam penthiopyrad picoxystrobin fluridone norflurazon sorafenib and triflurazin a relevant agrochemical is trifluralin the development of synthetic methods for adding trifluoromethyl groups to chemical compounds is actively pursued in academic research the first to investigate trifluoromethyl groups in relationship to biological activity was f lehmann in 1927 an early review appeared in 1958 an early synthetic method was developed by fr d ric swarts in 1892 based on antimony fluoride in this reaction benzotrichloride was reacted with sbf to form phcfcl and phcf in the 1930s kinetic chemicals and ig farben replaced sbf with hf the mcloughlin thrower reaction 1968 is an early coupling reaction using iodofluoroalkanes iodoaromatic compounds and copper in 1969 kobayashi kumadaki adapted their protocol for trifluoromethylations preparation of the trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane was reported by ingo ruppert in 1984 in 1989 prakash and olah first reported activation of tmscf by fluoride to perform nucleophilic trifluoromethylation of carbonyl compounds in the same year stahly described similar reactions for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated phenols and anilines since then tmscf has been

cost sharing is easy when the marginal cost is constant in this case each agent who wants the service just pays its marginal cost cost sharing becomes more interesting when the marginal cost is not constant with increasing marginal costs the agents impose a negative externality on each other with decreasing marginal costs the agents impose a positive externality on each other see example below the goal of a cost sharing mechanism is to divide this externality among the agents there are various cost sharing mechanisms depending on the type of product service and the type of cost function in this setting several agents share a production technology they have to decide how much to produce and how to share the cost of production the technology has increasing marginal cost the more is produced the harder it becomes to produce more units i e the cost is a convex function of the demand an example cost function is so if there are three agents whose demands are 3 and 6 and 10 then the total cost is 100 a cost sharing problem is defined by the following functions where i is an agent and q is a quantity of the

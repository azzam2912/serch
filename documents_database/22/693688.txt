members of this order are sometimes called pin molds the term mucormycosis is now preferred for infections caused by molds belonging to the order mucorales the order includes 12 13 families 56 genera and approximately 300 species mucoralean classification has traditionally been based on morphological developmental and ecological characters recently molecular data have revealed that some aspects of traditional classification are quite artificial for example the mucoraceae is believed to be polyphyletic as are the thamnidiaceae chaetocladiaceae and radiomycetaceae some of the genera including mucor absidia and backusella appear to be polyphyletic today the traditional system is still largely in use as further studies are needed to reconcile morphological and molecular concepts of families and genera the order consists of the following families mucoralean fungi are typically fast growing and their wide hyphae lack septa multiperforate septa are present only in sporangiophores and gametangia the hyphae grow mostly within the substrate sporangiophores are upright simple or ramified hyphae that support sac like sporangia filled with asexual sporangiospores other structures include merosporangia oldia and sporangiola many are known by the damage they do to stored food such as bread others can cause mucormycosis generally in immunosuppressed patients or patients already infected

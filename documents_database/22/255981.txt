the system was one of the first major applications of gallium arsenide gaas semiconductors in computing using hundreds of custom built ics packed into a cpu the design goal was performance around 16 gflops about 12 times that of the cray 2 work started on the cray 3 in 1988 at cray research s cri development labs in chippewa falls wisconsin other teams at the lab were working on designs with similar performance to focus the teams the cray 3 effort was moved to a new lab in colorado springs colorado later that year shortly thereafter the corporate headquarters in minneapolis decided to end work on the cray 3 in favor of another design the cray c90 in 1989 the cray 3 effort was spun off to a newly formed company cray computer corporation ccc the launch customer lawrence livermore national laboratory cancelled their order in 1991 and a number of company executives left shortly thereafter the first machine was finally ready in 1993 but with no launch customer it was instead loaned as a demonstration unit to the nearby national center for atmospheric research in boulder the company went bankrupt in may 1995 and the machine was officially decommissioned

the concept was developed by the astronautical engineering students of purdue university during the 2017 nasa jpl planetary science summer school oceanus is an orbiter which would enable a detailed study of the structure of the planet s magnetosphere and interior structure that would not be possible with a flyby mission because of the required technology development and planetary orbital dynamics the concept suggests a launch in august 2030 on an atlas v 511 rocket and entering uranus orbit in 2041 ice giant sized planets are the most common type of planet according to kepler data the little data available on uranus an ice giant planet come from ground based observations and the single flyby of the voyager 2 spacecraft so its exact composition and structure are essentially unknown as internal heat flux and cause of its unique magnetic fields and extreme axial tilt or obliquity making it a compelling target for exploration according to the planetary science decadal survey the primary science objectives of oceanus are to study uranus interior structure magnetosphere and the uranian atmosphere the required mission budget is estimated at 1 2 billion the mission concept has not been formally proposed to nasa s new frontiers

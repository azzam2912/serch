a parabola in the common sense can be described by an equation formula 4 solving a for formula 5 yields the second explicit form equation a shows that is a parametric representation of the curve the arc length of the curve was calculated by the english mathematician william neile and published in 1657 see section history proof the similarity formula 10 uniform scaling maps the semicubical parabola formula 8 onto the curve formula 12 with formula 13 the proof follows from the tangent vector formula 17 only for formula 18 this vector has zero length differentiating the semicubical unit parabola formula 19 one gets at point formula 20 of the upper branch the equation of the tangent this tangent intersects the lower branch at exactly one further point with coordinates proving this statement one should use the fact that the tangent meets the curve at formula 23 twice determining the arclength of a curve formula 24 one has to solve the integral formula 25 for the semicubical parabola formula 26 one gets example for formula 29 semicubical unit parabola and formula 30 which means the length of the arc between the origin and point formula 31 one gets the arc

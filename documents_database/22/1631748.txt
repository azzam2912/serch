capillary action is one of the most common fluid mechanical effects explored in the field of microfluidics jurin s law is named after james jurin who discovered it between 1718 and 1719 his quantitative law suggests that the maximum height of liquid in a capillary tube is inversely proportional to the tube s diameter the difference in height between the surroundings of the tube and the inside as well as the shape of the meniscus are caused by capillary action the mathematical expression of this law can be derived directly from hydrostatic principles and the young laplace equation jurin s law allows the measurement of the surface tension of a liquid and can be used to derive the capillary length the law is expressed as where it is only valid if the tube is cylindrical and has a radius r smaller than the capillary length formula 2 in terms of the capillary length the law can be written as for a water filled glass tube in air at standard conditions for temperature and pressure at 20 c and for these values the height of the water column is thus for a radius glass tube in lab conditions given above the

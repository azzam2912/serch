or at least this holds for the linearized theory for the full nonlinear theory less is known several difficulties arise when interactions of mixed symmetry fields are considered but at least in situations involving an infinite number of such fields notably string theory these difficulties are not insurmountable in four spacetime dimensions the field is not dual to the graviton if massless but it can be used to describe massive pure spin 2 quanta similar descriptions exist for other massive higher spins in d 4 the simplest example of the linearized theory is given by a rank three lorentz tensor formula 1 whose indices carry the permutation symmetry of the young diagram corresponding to the integer partition 3 2 1 that is to say formula 2 and formula 3 where indices in square brackets are totally antisymmetrized the corresponding field strength for formula 1 is formula 5 this has a nontrivial trace formula 6 where formula 7 is the minkowski metric with signature the action for formula 1 in d spacetime dimensions is bilinear in the field strength and its trace this action is gauge invariant assuming there is zero net contribution from any boundaries while the field strength itself

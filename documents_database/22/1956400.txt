it is the best solar twin found to date having the near temperature and mass as our sun ybp 1194 has a higher metallicity than the sun ybp 1194 is 0 5 billion years younger than the sun at an age of 4 2 billion years old but due to the distance the error bar is high at 1 6 billion years on december 19 2013 it was announced to have an extrasolar planet with a period of 6 9 days and a high eccentricity of 0 24 with a mass of ybp 1194 is about 2 772 light years 850 parsecs from the sun ybp 1194 is packed in a small cluster m67 ngc 2682 with a radius 10 ly with over 500 other stars for comparison the sun has 17 stars at a distance of 10 ly and about 134 stars at a distance of 20 ly exoplanet ybp 1194 b was discovered in january 2014 by researchers at the european southern observatory eso when three new planets were discovered in the m67 cluster one of them orbiting ypb 1194 showing that open star clusters are more likely to have planets orbiting them than originally thought the exoplanet

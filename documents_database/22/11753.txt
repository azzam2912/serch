although any type of object can be collected into a set set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics the language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects the modern study of set theory was initiated by georg cantor and richard dedekind in the 1870s after the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory such as russell s paradox numerous axiom systems were proposed in the early twentieth century of which the zermelo fraenkel axioms with or without the axiom of choice are the best known set theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for mathematics particularly in the form of zermelo fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice beyond its foundational role set theory is a branch of mathematics in its own right with an active research community contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals mathematical topics typically emerge and evolve through interactions among many researchers set theory however was founded by a single paper in 1874 by georg cantor on a property of the

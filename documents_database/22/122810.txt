the element is created by rotating a line segment of length around some axis located units away so that a cylindrical volume of units is enclosed two common methods for finding the volume of a solid of revolution are the disc method and the shell method of integration to apply these methods it is easiest to draw the graph in question identify the area that is to be revolved about the axis of revolution determine the volume of either a disc shaped slice of the solid with thickness or a cylindrical shell of width and then find the limiting sum of these volumes as approaches 0 a value which may be found by evaluating a suitable integral the disk method is used when the slice that was drawn is perpendicular to the axis of revolution i e when integrating parallel to the axis of revolution the volume of the solid formed by rotating the area between the curves of and and the lines and about the axis is given by if e g revolving an area between the curve and the axis this reduces to the method can be visualized by considering a thin horizontal rectangle at between on top

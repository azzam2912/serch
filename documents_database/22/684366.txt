they prevent members of different species from producing offspring or ensure that any offspring are sterile these barriers maintain the integrity of a species by reducing gene flow between related species the mechanisms of reproductive isolation have been classified in a number of ways zoologist ernst mayr classified the mechanisms of reproductive isolation in two broad categories pre zygotic for those that act before fertilization or before mating in the case of animals and post zygotic for those that act after it the mechanisms are genetically controlled and can appear in species whose geographic distributions overlap sympatric speciation or are separate allopatric speciation pre zygotic isolation mechanisms are the most economic in terms of the natural selection of a population as resources are not wasted on the production of a descendant that is weak non viable or sterile these mechanisms include physiological or systemic barriers to fertilization any of the factors that prevent potentially fertile individuals from meeting will reproductively isolate the members of distinct species the types of barriers that can cause this isolation include different habitats physical barriers and a difference in the time of sexual maturity or flowering an example of the ecological or habitat differences that

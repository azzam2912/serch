it holds thousands of galaxies together it is located at a distance of 2 4 billion light years from earth astronomers noticed an invisible string of matter was warping spacetime between abell 222 and abell 223 upon further examination by using images from the japanese subaru telescope astronomers discovered that this invisible matter is in fact dark matter the astronomers used gravitational lensing to detect the dark matter filaments the cluster is connected by a filament of dark matter to abell 223 that is permeated by hot x ray emitting gas further research shows that this filament only contains about 20 percent of normal matter the rest is assumed to be dark matter this is seen to be in good agreement with the cosmological standard model 5 of the universe is made up of baryonic or ordinary matter which contains protons and neutrons also known as baryons and electrons baryons and electrons are the foundation for atoms astronomers have not been able to locate the full 5 of baryonic matter within other galaxies stars or gases after observing gas that connects abell 222 and abell 223 scientists believe that the missing baryonic matter is within the gas that bridges the

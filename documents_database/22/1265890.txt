the pseudotooth birds or pelagornithids were probably rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks or of waterfowl and are here placed in the order odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty up to five species are commonly recognized in this genus but actually the genus pseudodontornis is barely more than a nomen nudum and though it served as the namesake for a popular alternate common name of the pseudotooth birds pseudodontorns or pseudodontornids that was extensively used in the 20th century current authors prefer pelagornithids because this is less fraught with taxonomic dispute pelagornis the type genus of the family pelagornithidae was long unrecognized as a pseudotooth bird as it was known mainly from arm bones thus though the pelagornithidae were long recognized as very distinct they were allied with the cormorant and gannet in suborder sulae or superfamily sulides in suborder pelecanae before it was recognized that they are actually pseudotooth birds the presumed family pseudodontornithidae deemed invalid nowadays had been recognized as pseudotooth birds all along as they were established based on skull fossils preserving parts of the toothed beak one of the species typically placed here though in fact one that is rather unlikely to actually belong

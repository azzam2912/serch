the more efficient heat transfer from the heated surface in the form of heat of vaporization plus sensible heat and the motions of the bubbles bubble driven turbulence and convection leads to rapid mixing of the fluid therefore boiling heat transfer has played an important role in industrial heat transfer processes such as macroscopic heat transfer exchangers in nuclear and fossil power plants and in microscopic heat transfer devices such as heat pipes and microchannels for cooling electronic chips the use of boiling is limited by a condition called critical heat flux chf which is also called a boiling crisis or departure from nucleate boiling dnb the most serious problem is that the boiling limitation can be directly related to the physical burnout of the materials of a heated surface due to the suddenly inefficient heat transfer through a vapor film formed across the surface resulting from the replacement of liquid by vapor adjacent to the heated surface consequently the occurrence of chf is accompanied by an inordinate increase in the surface temperature for a surface heat flux controlled system otherwise an inordinate decrease of the heat transfer rate occurs for a surface temperature controlled system this can be explained

x energy is developing generation iv high temperature gas cooled nuclear reactor designs in january 2016 x energy was awarded a five year 53m united states department of energy advanced reactor concept cooperative agreement award to advance elements of their reactor development the company was founded in 2009 by kam ghaffarian the xe 100 is a pebble bed high temperature gas cooled nuclear reactor design that is planned to be smaller simpler and safer when compared to conventional nuclear designs pebble bed high temperature gas cooled reactors were first proposed in 1944 each reactor is planned to generate 200 mwt and approximately 76 mwe the standard xe 100 four pack plant would generate approximately 300 mwe and will fit on 13 acres all of the components for the xe 100 are planned to be road transportable and be installed rather than constructed at the project site to streamline construction the company objective is to incorporate innovative design features with the goal of building a small scale nuclear energy source that can be adapted to a variety of markets the fuel for the xe 100 is a spherical fuel element or pebble that utilizes the triso particle nuclear fuel design the

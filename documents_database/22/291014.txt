it is composed of 411 amino acids weighing about 88 5kda it functions as an anticoagulant inhibiting coagulation factors ix ixa and x xa thus keeping the blood of the bitten victim from clotting while the bat is drinking draculin is a reversible slow tight binding noncompetitive inhibitor of fxa it does not act on thrombin trypsin or chymotrypsin and does not express fibrinolytic activity the protein increases the lag phase as well as the height of the peak of thrombin generation when in plasma leading to prolonged bleeding daily salivation of vampire bats yields a saliva that progressively decreases in anticoagulant activity however there is no significant change in overall protein content during this time after a 4 day period of rest anticoagulant activity of the saliva is restored in addition purified native draculin obtained from high and low activity saliva shows significant differences in composition of the carbohydrate moiety and glycosylation pattern furthermore controlled chemical deglycosylation of native draculin progressively leads to complete loss of the biological activity despite the conditions leaving the polypeptide backbone intact draculin is currently being explored in medicine the anticoagulant may be useful as a treatment for strokes and heart attacks it may

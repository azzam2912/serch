pigs have a great sense of smell and are able to identify truffles from as deep as three feet underground it is thought that the natural sex hormones of the male pig are similar to the smell of the truffles and also pigs have a natural affinity for rooting in the earth for food they are trained to hunt truffles by walking on a leash through suitable groves with a keeper the use of the pig to hunt truffles is said to date back to the roman empire but the first well documented use comes from the italian renaissance writer and gastronomist bartolomeo platina in the 15th century later references to truffle pigs include john ray in the 17th century in 1875 a truffle hog could cost up to 200 francs a skilled truffler could more than make up for this investment due to the high price of truffles on the gourmet food market today it is common for dogs known as truffle hounds as well as truffle hogs to be used in the gathering of truffles because hogs have been known to eat too many truffles in the field however traditionalists argue that the swine have more sensitive noses

the test may be between mutually insulated sections of a part or energized parts and electrical ground the test is a means to qualify a device s ability to operate safely during rated electrical conditions if the current through a device under test is less than a specified limit at the required test potential and time duration the device meets the dielectric withstand requirement a dielectric withstand test may be done as a factory test on new equipment or may be done on apparatus already in service as a routine maintenance test voltage withstand testing is done with a high voltage source and voltage and current meters a single instrument called a hipot tester is often used to perform this test it applies the necessary voltages to a device and monitors leakage current the current can trip a fault indicator the tester has output overload protection the test voltage may be either direct current or alternating current at power frequency or other frequency like resonant frequency 30 to 300 hz determined by load or vlf 0 01 hz to 0 1 hz when convenient the maximum voltage is given in the test standard for the particular product the application rate

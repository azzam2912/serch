the format is indicated in three ways see chemical mime section chemical markup language cml is an open standard for representing molecular and other chemical data the open source project includes xml schema source code for parsing and working with cml data and an active community the articles tools for working with chemical markup language and xml for chemistry and biosciences discusses cml in more detail cml data files are accepted by many tools including jchempaint jmol xdrawchem and marvinview the protein data bank format is commonly used for proteins but it can be used for other types of molecules as well it was originally designed as and continues to be a fixed column width format and thus officially has a built in maximum number of atoms of residues and of chains this resulted in splitting very large structures such as ribosomes into multiple files however many tools can read files that exceed those limits for example the e coli 70s ribosome was represented as 4 pdb files in 2009 3i1m 3i1n 3i1o and 3i1p in 2014 they were consolidated into a single file 4v6c some pdb files contain an optional section describing atom connectivity as well as position because

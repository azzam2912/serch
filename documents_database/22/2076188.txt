the campaign involved a variety of policies including greater freedoms being granted to islamist groups greater resources being put into religious programmes increased use of islamic punishments and a more general greater emphasis being put on islam in all sectors of iraqi life the campaign was conducted under the supervision of izzat ibrahim al douri who would later become saddam hussein s successor as leader of the ba ath party douri used the campaign to promote his naqshbandi sufi order which would later form the nucleus of the army of the men of the naqshbandi order whilst the ba athist leadership traditionally viewed islamists as backwards treating them with suspicion towards the end of the 1980s the iraqi government began to make overtures towards the muslim brotherhood as well as other sunni and shiite islamist groups other initial signs of this turn to islamism were saddam s claim that ba ath party founder michel aflaq had converted to islam on his deathbed and also the adding of the takbir to the iraqi flag in 1991 one interpretation states that such a repudiation of ba athism s traditionally secularist stance was driven possibly not by a genuine shift in saddam hussein

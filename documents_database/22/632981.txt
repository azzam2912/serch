originally conceived by c forbes dewey of mit and inventor chester schuler it was founded formally in 1981 its target market was real time computing with a focus on high speed data acquisition its major innovation was that it created the first widely available computer product which was able to sample analog signals at one million samples per second and store the resulting data to disk continuously given the technology available at the time motorola 68000 series cpus of only a few megahertz in speed and slow disk drives this product represented quite a technological achievement the masscomp mc 500 is a 68000 based microcomputer running a real time variant of the unix operating system for a small company masscomp incorporated a number of ambitious and innovative projects in addition to real time unix including their own c and fortran compiler a block diagram language known as laboratory workbench that allowed visual programming of real time systems to connect real time analog inputs and outputs to signal processing operations and interactive virtual instruments for data display and their own high level graphics subsystem masscomp grew to about 65 million in sales per year and ultimately purchased concurrent computer corporation in

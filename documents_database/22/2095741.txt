the linear functional formula 4 is called a trace morphism a pair formula 5 if it is exists is unique up to a natural isomorphism in fact in the language of category theory formula 1 is an object representing the contravariant functor formula 7 from the category of coherent sheaves on x to the category of k vector spaces for a normal projective variety x the dualizing sheaf exists and it is in fact the canonical sheaf formula 8 where formula 9 is a canonical divisor more generally the dualizing sheaf exists for any projective scheme there is the following variant of serre s duality theorem for a projective scheme x of pure dimension n and a cohen macaulay sheaf f on x such that formula 10 is of pure dimension n there is a natural isomorphism in particular if x itself is a cohen macaulay scheme then the above duality holds for any locally free sheaf given a proper finitely presented morphism of schemes formula 12 defines the relative dualizing sheaf formula 13 or formula 14 as the sheaf such that for each open subset formula 15 and a quasi coherent sheaf formula 16 on formula 17 there is

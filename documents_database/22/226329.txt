radiocontrast agents are typically iodine or more rarely barium sulphate they absorb external x rays resulting in decreased exposure on the x ray detector this is different from radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine which emit radiation magnetic resonance imaging mri functions through different principles and thus utilizes different contrast agents these compounds work by altering the magnetic properties of nearby hydrogen nuclei radiocontrast agents used in x ray examinations can be grouped based on its use iodine has a particular advantage as a contrast agent because its innermost electron k shell binding energy is 33 2 kev similar to the average energy of x rays used in diagnostic radiography when the incident x ray energy is closer to the k edge of the atom it encounters photoelectric absorption is more likely to occur iodinated contrast contains iodine it is the main type of radiocontrast used for intravenous administration its uses include organic iodine molecules used for contrast include iohexol iodixanol and ioversol barium sulfate is mainly used in the imaging of the digestive system the substance exists as a water insoluble white powder that is made into a slurry with water and administered directly into the gastrointestinal tract barium sulfate

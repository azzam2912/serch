it is also known as or cluster of differentiation 159c cd159c natural killer nk cells are lymphocytes that can mediate lysis of certain tumor cells and virus infected cells without previous activation they can also regulate specific humoral and cell mediated immunity nk cells preferentially express several calcium dependent c type lectins which have been implicated in the regulation of nk cell function the group designated klrc nkg2 are expressed primarily in natural killer nk cells and encodes a family of transmembrane proteins characterized by a type ii membrane orientation extracellular c terminus and the presence of a c type lectin domain the klrc nkg2 gene family is located within the nk complex a region that contains several c type lectin genes preferentially expressed on nk cells klrc2 alternative splice variants have been described but their full length nature has not been determined klrc2 has been shown to interact and form dimers with cd94 the cd94 nkg2c heterodimer can bind to hla e and this binding leads to nk cells activation during infection with human cytomegalovirus peptides derived from the virus are presented on hla e and natural killer cells that express the cd94 nkg2c receptor can specifically recognise the

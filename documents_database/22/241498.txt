the approximately 53 volcanoes in the field have produced a diverse array of maars explosion craters tuff rings scoria cones and lava flows no volcano has erupted twice but eruptions lasted for various periods ranging from a few weeks to several years the field is fuelled entirely by basaltic magma unlike the explosive subduction driven volcanism in the central north island such as at mount ruapehu and lake taupo the field is currently dormant but could become active again the field ranges from lake pupuke and rangitoto island in the north to matukutururu wiri mountain in the south and from mount albert in the west to pigeon mountain in the east the first vent erupted at onepoto 248 000 28 000 years ago the most recent eruption about 600 years ago and within historical memory of the local m ori iwi was of rangitoto an island shield volcano just east of the city erupting 2 3 cubic kilometres of lava the eruptions have tended to become bigger over time with rangitoto making up almost 60 per cent of the field s entire volume of erupted material the field s volcanoes are relatively small with most less than in height lake

it is made from two prisms of a birefringent material such as calcite usually cemented together the s narmont prism is named after henri hureau de s narmont it is similar to the rochon and wollaston prisms in the s narmont prism the s polarized ray i e the ray with polarization direction perpendicular to the plane in which all rays are contained called the plane of incidence passes through without being deflected while the p polarized ray with polarization direction in the plane of incidence is deflected refracted at the internal interface into a different direction both rays correspond to ordinary rays o rays in the first component prism since both polarization directions are perpendicular to the optical axis which is the propagation direction in the second component prism the s polarized ray remains ordinary o ray polarized perpendicular to the optical axis while the p polarized ray becomes extraordinary e ray with a polarization component along the optical axis as a consequence the s polarized ray is not deflected since the effective refractive index does not change across the interface the p polarized wave on the other hand is refracted because the effective refractive index changes upon changing

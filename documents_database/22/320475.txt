these are often chosen when more than 2 positions are needed such as a three speed fan or a cb radio with multiple frequencies of reception or channels a rotary switch consists of a spindle or rotor that has a contact arm or spoke which projects from its surface like a cam it has an array of terminals arranged in a circle around the rotor each of which serves as a contact for the spoke through which any one of a number of different electrical circuits can be connected to the rotor the switch is layered to allow the use of multiple poles each layer is equivalent to one pole usually such a switch has a detent mechanism so it clicks from one active position to another rather than stalls in an intermediate position thus a rotary switch provides greater pole and throw capabilities than simpler switches do rotary switches were used as channel selectors on television receivers until the early 1970s as range selectors on electrical metering equipment as band selectors on multi band radios etc modern rotary switches use a star wheel mechanism to provide the switching positions such as at every 30 45 60 or 90 degrees

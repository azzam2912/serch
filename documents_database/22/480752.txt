markers use an expanding gas such as carbon dioxide co or compressed air to propel paintballs through the barrel and quickly strike a target the term marker is derived from its original use as a means for forestry personnel to mark trees and ranchers to mark wandering cattle the muzzle velocity of paintball markers is approximately most paintball fields restrict speed to 280 ft s and small indoor fields may further restrict it down to 250 ft s while greater muzzle velocity is possible it has been ruled unsafe for use on most commercial paintball fields when paintballs hit an object at high speed they have the potential to cause damage a paintball colliding with human skin even protected by cloth may cause bruising or further tissue damage however the damage depends on the paintball s velocity distance its impact angle whether it breaks and which part of the body it hits because of the potential for serious soft tissue damage paintball players must wear masks to protect their eyes mouth and ears when barrel blocking devices are not preventing paintball markers from firing most paintball markers can be disassembled into four main components the body hopper barrel and gas

this genus as delimited by authors of the late 19th and early 20th century contained hundreds of species and was successively split into different groupings over time infrageneric groups subgenera were elevated to the rank of independent genera and the genus melania was elevated to the rank of a family melanidae however the genus name melania lamarck 1799 was demonstrated to be a junior synonym of the genus name thiara r ding 1798 consequently the family had to be renamed thiaridae moreover the melanidae as traditionally circumscribed were found to be polyphyletic containing species from many different groups which were successively recognized as distinct families such as the pachychilidae semisulcospiridae pleuroceridae melanopsidae and paludomidae therefore the thiaridae as currently circumscribed contain fewer species than the melaniidae this family of snails is found worldwide and are particularly diverse in the tropics and subtropics these snails are freshwater inhabitants of temperate and warm zones thiaridae are partly viviparous partly ovoviviparous many but not all species are parthenogenetic genera in the family thiaridae include this article incorporates public domain text from the reference

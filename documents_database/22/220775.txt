merlin engines use rp 1 and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants in a gas generator power cycle the merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse the injector at the heart of merlin is of the pintle type that was first used in the apollo program for the lunar module landing engine lmde propellants are fed via a single shaft dual impeller turbopump the turbopump also provides high pressure fluid for the hydraulic actuators which then recycles into the low pressure inlet this eliminates the need for a separate hydraulic drive system and means that thrust vectoring control failure by running out of hydraulic fluid is not possible the initial version the merlin 1a used an inexpensive expendable ablatively cooled carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite nozzle and produced of thrust the merlin 1a flew only twice first on march 24 2006 when it caught fire and failed due to a fuel leak shortly after launch and the second time on march 21 2007 when it performed successfully both times the merlin 1a was mounted on a falcon 1 first stage the spacex turbopump was an entirely new clean sheet design contracted to barber nichols inc in 2002 who

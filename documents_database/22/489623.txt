most generally it is the ability of moving water flowing or waves to dislodge and transport rock particles within this rubric are a number of specific erosional processes including abrasion attrition corrasion saltation and scouring downcutting hydraulic action is distinguished from other types of water facilitated erosion such as static erosion where water leaches salts and floats off organic material from unconsolidated sediments and from chemical erosion more often called chemical weathering it is a mechanical process in which the moving water current flows against the banks and bed of a river thereby removing rock particles a primary example of hydraulic action is a wave striking a cliff face which compresses the air in cracks of the rocks this exerts pressure on the surrounding rock which can progressively crack break splinter and detach rock particles this is followed by the decompression of the air as the wave retreats which can occur suddenly with explosive force which additionally weakens the rock cracks are gradually widened so each wave compresses more air increasing the explosive force of its release thus the effect intensifies in a positive feedback system over time as the cracks may grow they sometimes form a sea cave the

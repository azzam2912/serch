this is often represented by the symbol h or h all bonds in the compound are broken in atomization and none are formed so enthalpies of atomization are always positive the associated standard enthalpy is known as the standard enthalpy of atomization h kj mol at 298 15 k or 25 degrees celsius and 101 3 kpa enthalpy of atomization is the amount of enthalpy change when a compound s bonds are broken and the component atoms are reduced to individual atoms enthalpy of atomization is denoted by the symbol ha the enthalpy change of atomization of gaseous ho is for example the sum of the ho h and h o bond dissociation enthalpies the enthalpy of atomization of an elemental solid is exactly the same as the enthalpy of sublimation for any elemental solid that becomes a monatomic gas upon evaporation when a diatomic element is converted to gaseous atoms only half a mole of molecules will be needed as the standard enthalpy change is based purely on the production of one mole of gaseous atoms when the atoms in the molecule are different isotopes of the same element the calculation becomes non trivial standard enthalpy of atomization is

during a run of a timed automaton clock values increase all with the same speed along the transitions of the automaton clock values can be compared to integers these comparisons form guards that may enable or disable transitions and by doing so constrain the possible behaviors of the automaton further clocks can be reset timed automata are a sub class of a type hybrid automata timed automata can be used to model and analyse the timing behavior of computer systems e g real time systems or networks methods for checking both safety and liveness properties have been developed and intensively studied over the last 20 years it has been shown that the state reachability problem for timed automata is decidable which makes this an interesting sub class of hybrid automata extensions have been extensively studied among them stopwatches real time tasks cost functions and timed games there exists a variety of tools to input and analyse timed automata and extensions including the model checkers uppaal kronos and the schedulability analyser times these tools are becoming more and more mature but are still all academic research tools before formally defining what a timed automaton is some examples are given consider the

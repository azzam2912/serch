he would spell out the town s name carefully and deliberately when giving his contact details the album starts with a quote from batchelor s radio advertisement i have personally won in 2007 the album was re issued on cd by emi with five bonus tracks the bonus tracks were not actually performed by the bonzo dog band but were from later solo projects performed by individual members of the group reviewing the album for allmusic david cleary said the delightfully clever humor of the bonzo dog band s prior releases almost totally eludes the group on this record songs here still parody familiar styles but generally do so in a leaden and unengaging manner a number of the selections here burlesque the late beatles buffalo springfield and similar bands lyrics and performances are bland and pedestrian by past group standards and a noticeable lack of enthusiasm permeates this disc this weak release is only recommended to completists mothers with children please note this record is inedible

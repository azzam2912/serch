it is also known as lorentz contraction or lorentz fitzgerald contraction after hendrik lorentz and george francis fitzgerald and is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light length contraction is only in the direction in which the body is travelling for standard objects this effect is negligible at everyday speeds and can be ignored for all regular purposes only becoming significant as the object approaches the speed of light relative to the observer length contraction was postulated by george fitzgerald 1889 and hendrik antoon lorentz 1892 to explain the negative outcome of the michelson morley experiment and to rescue the hypothesis of the stationary aether lorentz fitzgerald contraction hypothesis although both fitzgerald and lorentz alluded to the fact that electrostatic fields in motion were deformed heaviside ellipsoid after oliver heaviside who derived this deformation from electromagnetic theory in 1888 it was considered an ad hoc hypothesis because at this time there was no sufficient reason to assume that intermolecular forces behave the same way as electromagnetic ones in 1897 joseph larmor developed a model in which all forces are considered to be of electromagnetic origin and length contraction appeared to be a direct consequence of

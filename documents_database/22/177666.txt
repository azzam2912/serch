normally the amine group is bonded to another carboxylic group in a protein to make it a chain but since the end of a protein has only 1 out of 2 areas chained the free amine group is referred to the n terminus by convention peptide sequences are written n terminus to c terminus left to right in ltr languages this correlates the translation direction to the text direction because when a protein is translated from messenger rna it is created from n terminus to c terminus amino acids are added to the carbonyl end each amino acid has an amine group and a carboxylic group amino acids link to one another by peptide bonds which form through a dehydration reaction that joins the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amine group of the next in a head to tail manner to form a polypeptide chain the chain has two ends an amine group the n terminus and an unbound carboxyl group the c terminus when a protein is translated from messenger rna it is created from n terminus to c terminus the amino end of an amino acid on a charged trna during the elongation stage of

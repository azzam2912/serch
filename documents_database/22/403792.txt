while fimbriation almost invariably applies to both or all sides of a charge there are very unusual examples of fimbriation on one side only another rather rare form is double fimbriation blazoned double fimbriated where the charge or ordinary is accompanied by two stripes of colour instead of only one in cases of double fimbriation the outer colour is blazoned first the arms of mozirje in slovenia show an example of fimbriation that itself is fimbriated fimbriation may also be used when a charge is the same colour as the field on which it is placed a red charge placed on a red background may be necessary for instance where the charge and field are both a specific colour for symbolic or historical reasons and in these cases fimbriation becomes a necessity in order for the charge to be visible in some cases such as a fimbriated cross placed on a field of the same colour as the cross the effect is identical to the use of cross voided i e a cross shown in outline only according to the rule of tincture one of the fundamental rules of heraldic design colour may not be placed on colour nor metal

ars is used in the book to implement an a interpreter and an xml database system even the implementation of ars in c was used to demonstrate ars based programming principally the programming language scheme would have been perfectly all right to be used for these demonstration programs if scheme would include primitives supporting network programming database programming plus a few others required in this context the definition of the programming language scheme does not include those primitives however leaving this issue up to the implementors of the language the consequence is that there exist many scheme implementations almost none of them covering all areas essential for real application programs this is the historical background that gave birth to the development of ars the name ars being an acronym for ars scheme extensions indicates that ars has a lot to do with scheme but that it is not equivalent to scheme from a practical point of view a scheme implementation that includes support for regular expressions databases sockets and also provides an interface to the operating system can be called an ars language

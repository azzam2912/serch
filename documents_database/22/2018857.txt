the material is created in a process similar to that of silicene and graphene in which high vacuum and high temperature are used to deposit a layer of germanium atoms on a substrate high quality thin films of germanene have revealed unusual two dimensional structures with novel electronic properties suitable for semiconductor device applications and materials science research in september 2014 g le lay and others reported the deposition of a single atom thickness ordered and two dimensional multi phase film by molecular beam epitaxy upon a gold surface in a crystal lattice with miller indices 111 the structure was confirmed with scanning tunneling microscopy stm revealing a nearly flat honeycomb structure additional confirmation was obtained by spectroscopic measurement and density functional theory calculations the development of high quality and nearly flat single atom films created speculation that germanene may replace graphene if not merely add an alternative to the novel properties of related nanomaterials bampoulis and others have reported the formation of germanene on the outermost layer of gept nanocrystals atomically resolved stm images of germanene on gept nanocrystals reveal a buckled honeycomb structure this honeycomb lattice is composed of two hexagonal sublattices displaced by 0 2 in the

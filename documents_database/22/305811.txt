the concept is often used to describe why an object or entity takes a given path the way in which water flows is often given as an example for the idea in physics the path of least resistance is a heuristic from folk physics that can sometimes in very simple situations describe approximately what happens it is an approximation of the tendency to the least energy state other examples are what goes up must come down gravity and heat goes from hot to cold second law of thermodynamics but these simple descriptions are not derived from laws of physics and in more complicated cases these heuristics will fail to give even approximately correct results in electrical circuits for example the current always follows all available paths and in some simple cases the path of least resistance will take up most of the current but this will not be generally true in even slightly more complicated circuits it may seem for example that if there are three paths of approximately equal resistance the majority of the current will flow down one of the three paths however due to electrons repelling each other the total path of least resistance is in fact

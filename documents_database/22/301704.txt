if unchecked metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia which is arterial blood ph lower than 7 37 due to increased production of hydrogen ions by the body or the loss and or inability of the body to form bicarbonate in the kidney or gastrointestinal tract its causes are diverse and its consequences can be serious including coma and death together with respiratory acidosis it is one of the two general causes of acidemia terminology in most cases acidosis occurs first for reasons explained below free ions then diffuse into the blood lowering the ph arterial blood gas analysis detects acidemia ph lower than 7 35 when acidemia is present acidosis is presumed symptoms are not specific and diagnosis can be difficult unless the patient presents with clear indications for arterial blood gas sampling symptoms may include palpitations headache altered mental status such as severe anxiety due to hypoxia decreased visual acuity nausea vomiting abdominal pain altered appetite and weight gain muscle weakness bone pain and joint pain those in metabolic acidosis may exhibit deep rapid breathing called kussmaul respirations which is classically associated with diabetic ketoacidosis rapid deep breaths increase the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled thus lowering the serum

sodium methoxide and potassium methoxide have widespread use though other metal cation variants such as lithium methoxide rubidium methoxide and caesium methoxide exist as well the methoxide ion has the formula of cho and is the conjugate base of methanol it is a strong organic base even stronger than the inorganic hydroxide ion as such methoxide solutions must be kept free of water otherwise the methoxide will remove a proton from a water molecule yielding methanol and hydroxide sodium methoxide also called sodium methylate and sodium methanolate is a white powder when pure it is used as an initiator of an anionic addition polymerization with ethylene oxide forming a polyether with high molecular weight both sodium methoxide and its counterpart prepared with potassium are frequently used as catalysts for commercial scale production of biodiesel in this process vegetable oils or animal fats which chemically are fatty acid triglycerides are transesterified with methanol to give fatty acid methyl esters fames sodium methoxide is produced on an industrial scale and available from a number of chemical companies potassium methoxide is commonly used as a catalyst for transesterification in the production of biodiesel

in other words if coalgebras are thought of as a sort of linear analogue of sets then the measuring coalgebra is a sort of linear analogue of the set of homomorphisms from a to b in particular its group like elements are essentially the homomorphisms from a to b measuring coalgebras were introduced by a coalgebra c with a linear map from c a to b is said to measure a to b if it preserves the algebra product and identity in the coalgebra sense if we think of the elements of c as linear maps from a to b this means that c a a c a c a where c c is the coproduct of c and c multiplies identities by the counit of c in particular if c is grouplike this just states that c is a homomorphism from a to b a measuring coalgebra is a universal coalgebra that measures a to b in the sense that any coalgebra that measures a to b can be mapped to it in a unique natural way

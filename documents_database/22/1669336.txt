volasertib is the second in a novel class of drugs called dihydropteridinone derivatives volasertib was awarded breakthrough drug status in september 2013 and orphan drug status for acute myeloid leukemia in april 2014 volasertib is a novel small molecule targeted therapy that blocks cell division by competitively binding to the atp binding pocket of the plk1 protein plk1 proteins are found in the nuclei of all dividing cells and control multiple stages of the cell cycle and cell division volasertib can be taken either orally or via intravenous infusion once circulating in the blood stream it is distributed throughout the body crosses the cell membrane and enters the nucleus of cells where it binds to its target plk1 volasertib inhibits plk1 preventing its roles in the cell cycle and cell division which leads to cell arrest and programmed cell death volasertib binds to and inhibits plk1 at nanomolar doses however it has also been shown to inhibit other plk family members plk2 and plk3 at higher micromolar doses the roles of plk2 and plk3 are less well understood however they are known to be active during the cell cycle and cell division volasertib inhibits plk1 in both cancer and normal

his fields of specialty include low surface brightness galaxies galaxy formation and evolution tests of dark matter and alternative hypotheses and measurements of cosmological parameters stacy mcgaugh was an undergraduate student at mit s b 1985 and a graduate student at princeton and the university of michigan ph d 1992 he held postdoctoral appointments at cambridge university the carnegie institution of washington and rutgers university before joining the faculty of the university of maryland in 1998 he moved to case western in 2012 he is married with two children he is a distinguished alumnus of flint michigan northern high school 2001 and of the astronomy department of the university of michigan 2013 known in the field of extragalactic astronomy for his early work on low surface brightness galaxies and the elemental abundances in hii regions mcgaugh has also contributed to the study of the kinematics of galaxies being among the first to point out that low surface brightness galaxies are dark matter dominated and that they pose the cuspy halo problem he also coined the expression baryonic tully fisher relation he predicted the first to second peak amplitude ratio of the acoustic power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation

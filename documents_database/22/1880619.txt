s r compatibility has been described as the naturalness of the association between a stimulus and its response such as a left oriented stimulus requiring a response from the left side of the body a high level of s r compatibility is typically associated with a shorter reaction time whereas a low level of s r compatibility tends to result in a longer reaction time a phenomenon known as the simon effect the term stimulus response compatibility was first coined by arnold small in a presentation in 1951 s r compatibility can be seen in the variation in the amount of time taken to respond to a visual stimulus given the similarity of the event that prompts the action and the action itself for example a visual stimulus in the left of a person s field of vision is more compatible with a response involving the left hand than with a response involving the right hand in 1953 paul fitts and c m seeger ran the first experiment conclusively demonstrating that certain responses are more compatible with certain stimuli during which subjects were alternatively instructed to press buttons on their left and right in response to lights which could appear

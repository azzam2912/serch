to do this geovisualization communicates geospatial information in ways that when combined with human understanding allow for data exploration and decision making processes traditional static maps have a limited exploratory capability the graphical representations are inextricably linked to the geographical information beneath gis and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps including the ability to explore different layers of the map to zoom in or out and to change the visual appearance of the map usually on a computer display geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly the term visualization is first mentioned in the cartographic literature at least as early as 1953 in an article by university of chicago geographer allen k philbrick new developments in the field of computer science prompted the national science foundation to redefine the term in a 1987 report which placed visualization at the convergence of computer graphics image processing computer vision computer aided design signal processing and user interface studies and emphasized both the knowledge creation and hypothesis generation aspects of scientific visualization geovisualization

their formation is associated with crystallization of polymers from the melt and is controlled by several parameters such as the number of nucleation sites structure of the polymer molecules cooling rate etc depending on those parameters spherulite diameter may vary in a wide range from a few micrometers to millimeters spherulites are composed of highly ordered lamellae which result in higher density hardness but also brittleness when compared to disordered regions in a polymer the lamellae are connected by amorphous regions which provide elasticity and impact resistance alignment of the polymer molecules within the lamellae results in birefringence producing a variety of colored patterns including a maltese cross when spherulites are viewed between crossed polarizers in an optical microscope if a molten linear polymer such as polyethylene is cooled down rapidly then the orientation of its molecules which are randomly aligned curved and entangled remain frozen and the solid has disordered structure however upon slow cooling some polymer chains take on a certain orderly configuration they align themselves in plates called crystalline lamellae growth from the melt would follow the temperature gradient see figure for example if the gradient is directed normal to the direction of molecular alignment then the

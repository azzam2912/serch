their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release heart rate insulin secretion neuronal excitability epithelial electrolyte transport smooth muscle contraction and cell volume kcne5 encodes a membrane protein kcne5 originally named kcne1 l that has sequence similarity to the kcne1 gene product a member of the potassium channel voltage gated isk related subfamily the kcne gene family comprises five genes in the human genome each encoding a type i membrane protein the kcne subunits are potassium channel regulatory subunits that do not pass currents themselves but alter the properties of potassium channel pore forming alpha subunits kcne5 is thus far the least studied member of the kcne family but it is known to regulate a number of different k channel subtypes kcne5 co assembles with kcnq1 a k alpha subunit best known for its role in ventricular repolarization and in multiple epithelia this co assembly induces a 140 mv shift in voltage dependence of activation when co expressed in cho cells which would inhibit kcnq1 activity across the normal physiological voltage range in most tissues kcne5 also inhibits activity of channels formed with kcnq1 and kcne1 while reportedly not affecting kcnq2 kcnq2 3 or kcnq5 channel activity kcne5 inhibits kcnq4 in

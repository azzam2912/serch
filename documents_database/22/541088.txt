cvp reflects the amount of blood returning to the heart and the ability of the heart to pump the blood back into the arterial system cvp is often a good approximation of right atrial pressure rap although the two terms are not identical as a pressure differential can sometimes exist between the venae cavae and the right atrium cvp and rap can differ when arterial tone is altered this can be graphically depicted as changes in the slope of the venous return plotted against right atrial pressure where central venous pressure increases but right atrial pressure stays the same vr cvp rap cvp has been and often still is used as a surrogate for preload and changes in cvp in response to infusions of intravenous fluid have been used to predict volume responsiveness i e whether more fluid will improve cardiac output however there is increasing evidence that cvp whether as an absolute value or in terms of changes in response to fluid does not correlate with ventricular volume i e preload or volume responsiveness and so should not be used to guide intravenous fluid therapy nevertheless cvp monitoring is a useful tool to guide hemodynamic therapy the cardiopulmonary baroreflex

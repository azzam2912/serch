it was introduced in the paper lam s equation appears in the method of separation of variables applied to the laplace equation in elliptic coordinates in some special cases solutions can be expressed in terms of polynomials called lam polynomials lam s equation is where a and b are constants and formula 2 is the weierstrass elliptic function the most important case is when formula 3 where formula 4 is the elliptic sine function and formula 5 for an integer n and formula 6 the elliptic modulus in which case the solutions extend to meromorphic functions defined on the whole complex plane for other values of b the solutions have branch points by changing the independent variable to formula 7 with formula 8 lam s equation can also be rewritten in algebraic form as which after a change of variable becomes a special case of heun s equation a more general form of lam s equation is the ellipsoidal equation or ellipsoidal wave equation which can be written observe we now write formula 10 not formula 11 as above where formula 13 is the elliptic modulus of the jacobian elliptic functions and formula 14 and formula 15 are constants for

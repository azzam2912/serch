in terms of molecular orbital theory these compounds have in common a monocyclic array of molecular orbitals in which there is an odd number of out of phase overlaps the opposite pattern compared to the aromatic character to h ckel systems the nodal plane of the orbitals viewed as a ribbon is a m bius strip rather than a cylinder hence the name the pattern of orbital energies is given by a rotated frost circle with the edge of the polygon on the bottom instead of a vertex so systems with 4 n electrons are aromatic while those with 4 n 2 electrons are anti aromatic non aromatic due to incrementally twisted nature of the orbitals of a m bius aromatic system stable m bius aromatic molecules need to contain at least 8 electrons although 4 electron m bius aromatic transition states are well known in the context of the dewar zimmerman framework for pericyclic reactions m bius molecular systems were considered in 1964 by edgar heilbronner by application of the h ckel method but the first such isolable compound was not synthesized until 2003 by the group of rainer herges however the fleeting trans ch cation one conformation of

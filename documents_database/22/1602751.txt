it is a relatively small area of sand dunes comprising sand of seven distinct colours approximately red brown violet green blue purple and yellow the main feature of the place is that since these differently coloured sands spontaneously settle in different layers dunes acquire a surrealistic striped colouring since the earth was first exposed rains have carved beautiful patterns into the hillside creating an effect of earthen meringue the sands formed from the decomposition of volcanic rock basalt gullies into clay further transformed into ferralitic soil by total hydrolysis the two main elements of the resulting soil iron and aluminium are responsible for red anthracite and blue purplish colours respectively the different shades of colour are believed to be a consequence of the molten volcanic rock cooling down at different external temperatures hence rates but the causes of their consistent spontaneous separation are yet to be fully clarified the name seven coloured earth s is a descriptive rather than an official name sources report many variations of this name including chamarel seven coloured earths chamarel coloured earth s coloured earth and in french this phenomenon can also be observed on a smaller scale if one takes a handful of sands

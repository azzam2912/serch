positional tracking registers the exact position due to recognition of the rotation pitch yaw and roll and recording of the translational movements since virtual reality is about emulating and altering reality it s important that we can track accurately how objects like the head or the hands move in real life in order to represent them inside vr defining the position and orientation of a real object in space is determined with the help of special sensors or markers sensors record the signal from the real object when it moves or is moved and transmit the received information to the computer wireless tracking uses a set of anchors that are placed around the perimeter of the tracking space and one or more tags that are tracked this system is similar in concept to gps but works both indoors and outdoors sometimes referred to as indoor gps the tags triangulate their 3d position using the anchors placed around the perimeter a wireless technology called ultra wideband has enabled the position tracking to reach a precision of under 100 mm by using sensor fusion and high speed algorithms the tracking precision can reach 5 mm level with update speeds of 200 hz

a profusion of alternate scientific names exists for this long known heavily discussed and spectacular group it has also been called gymnoblastea and with or without an emended ending ae anthomedusa athecata hydromedusa and stylasterina there are about 1 200 species worldwide these hydrozoans always have a polyp stage their hydranths grow either solitary or in colonies there is no firm perisarc around the polyp body the medusae or jellyfish are solitary animals with tentacles arising from the bell margin lacking statocysts but possessing radial canals their gonads are on the manubrium handle except in eudendriidae and laingiidae prey can be captured by discharging harpoon like structures desmonemes from chambers cnidae in specialized cells nematocysts on the tentacles in hydrozoans these are nearly always adhesive and entrapping rather than puncturing and poisoned as in other jellys the close relationship of the orders anthoathecata and leptomedusae has been long known but formerly it was also believed that these two were close to the order limnomedusae however their closest relatives are the highly advanced siphonophorae whereas the limnomedusae are a rather primitive group and not very closely related to these three leptolinae and might instead belong to the subclass trachylinae some uncertainty

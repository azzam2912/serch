the aperture is almost half as high as the entire shell the whorls of the spire are strongly appressed posteriorly but scarcely constricted increasing slowly in diameter the body whorl is attenuated and gradually tapering to the rather broad anterior extremity the spire contains 5 whorls the protoconch is entirely smooth highly polished a little more than thrice coiled the initial whorl is minute almost entirely submerged the succeeding volutions feebly inflated increasing rather rapidly in altitude and diameter the dividing line between the spire and the protoconch is indicated by an irregular thickening of the shell the appression of the posterior portion of the whorl and the initiation of the axial and spiral ornamentation the axial ribs are narrow more persistent posteriorly and more strongly protractive upon the early whorls rather broadly rounded continuing with scarcely diminished strength to the anterior suture and to the base of the body obsolete upon the appressed posterior margin nine ribs upon the later whorls of the spire including the body which is regularly costate except for the nearly terminal varix and the relatively feeble rib behind it the intercostal areas are somewhat flattened and of approximately the same width as the costals

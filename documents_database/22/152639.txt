bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot especially when a small variation in exposure parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots it is typically but not always used for static subjects autobracketing is a feature of many modern cameras when set it will automatically take several bracketed shots rather than the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot without further qualifications the term bracketing usually refers to exposure bracketing the photographer chooses to take one picture at a given exposure one or more brighter and one or more darker in order to select the most satisfactory image technically this can be accomplished by changing either the shutter speed or the aperture or with digital cameras the iso speed or combinations thereof exposure can also be changed by altering the light level for example using neutral gray filters or changing the degree of illumination of the subject e g artificial light flash since the aim here is to alter the amount of exposure but not otherwise the visual effect exposure compensation for static

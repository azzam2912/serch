this single image is more informative and accurate than any single source image and it consists of all the necessary information the purpose of image fusion is not only to reduce the amount of data but also to construct images that are more appropriate and understandable for the human and machine perception in computer vision multisensor image fusion is the process of combining relevant information from two or more images into a single image the resulting image will be more informative than any of the input images in remote sensing applications the increasing availability of space borne sensors gives a motivation for different image fusion algorithms several situations in image processing require high spatial and high spectral resolution in a single image most of the available equipment is not capable of providing such data convincingly image fusion techniques allow the integration of different information sources the fused image can have complementary spatial and spectral resolution characteristics however the standard image fusion techniques can distort the spectral information of the multispectral data while merging in satellite imaging two types of images are available the panchromatic image acquired by satellites is transmitted with the maximum resolution available and the multispectral data are

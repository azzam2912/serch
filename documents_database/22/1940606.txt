it is a colorless liquid that is a degradation product of methionine it is a notable flavor in potato based snacks namely potato chips one of the most popular foods containing methional traces of the compound can also be found in black tea and green tea based products methional contains both aldehyde and thioether functional groups it is readily soluble in alcohol solvents including propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol in nature methional is a thermally induced volatile flavor compound for instance the heat initiated maillard reaction of reducing sugars and amino acids forms the initial basis of methional s composition the formation of methional stems from the interaction of dicarbonyl compounds intermediate products in the maillard reaction with methionine met by the strecker degradation reaction methional easily degrades into methanethiol which then oxidizes into dimethyl disulfide dimethyl disulfide is partly responsible for the reactive sulfur that contributes to the taste of potatoes furthermore the methionine resulting from the strecker degradation reaction produces alkyl pyrazines which contribute to the flavors in roasted toasted or thermally processed foods due to the ease of its decomposition a large portion of methional is lost during potato processing similarly in the presence of flavin mononucleotide

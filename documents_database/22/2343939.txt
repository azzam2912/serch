they are a type of metallacycle metallacyclopentanes are intermediates in some metal catalysed reactions in homogeneous catalysis traditionally metallacyclopentanes are prepared by dialkylation of metal dihalides with 1 4 bis bromomagnesio butane or the related dilithio reagent the complex ni bipyridine ch is prepared by oxidative addition of 1 4 dibromobutane to ni 0 precursors metallacyclopentanes also arise via the dimerization of ethylene within the coordination sphere of a low valence metal center this reaction is relevant to the catalytic production of butenes and related alkenes early examples of metallacyclopentanes come from studies of the ni catalyzed linear and cyclo dimerization of ethylenes linear dimerization proceeds via beta hydride elimination of the nickelacyclopentane php ni ch whereas cyclodimerization to give cyclobutane proceeds by reductive elimination from the related php ni ch another example of a metallacyclopentane is the titanocene derivative cpti ch metallacyclopentanes are intermediates in the metal catalysed dimerization trimerization and tetramerization of ethylene to give 1 butene 1 hexene and 1 octene respectively these compounds are of commercial interest as comonomers used in the production of polyethylene in the evolution of heterogeneous alkene metathesis catalysts metallacyclopentanes are invoked as intermediates in the formation of metal alkylidenes from ethylene

tomboulis 1997 later extended this work by looking at an equivalent scalar tensor theory biswas mazumdar and siegel 2005 looked at bouncing frw solutions in 2011 biswas gerwick koivisto and mazumdar demonstrated that the most general infinite derivative action in 4 dimensions around constant curvature backgrounds parity invariant and torsion free can be expressed by where the formula 2 are functions of the d alembert operator formula 3 and a mass scale formula 4 formula 5 is the ricci scalar formula 6 is the ricci tensor and formula 7 is the weyl tensor in order to avoid ghosts the propagator which is a combination of the formula 8s must be the exponential of an entire function a lower bound was obtained on the mass scale of idg using experimental data on the strength of gravity at short distances as well as by using data on inflation and on the bending of light around the sun the ghy boundary terms were found using the adm 3 1 spacetime decomposition one can show that the entropy for this theory is finite in various contexts the effect of idg on black holes and the propagator was examined by modesto modesto further looked at

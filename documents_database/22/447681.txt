a tribrach allows the survey instrument to be repeatedly placed in the same position over a surveying marker point with sub millimetre precision by loosening and re tightening a lock to adjust the instrument base in a horizontal plane the device consists of two triangular metal plates connected at their corners by leveling thumbscrews a bubble level a locking mechanism and often an optical plummet the centre of the bottom plate of the tribrach has a 5 8 11 unc thread bolt hole which is used to attach the tribrach to the tripod the top plate has three small holes or slots spaced 120 apart above leveling thumbscrews and a locking mechanism which enables a survey instrument or target to be accurately placed on the tribrach and locked in place the optical plummet has either a bullseye or cross hair sight for positioning the instrument over a survey marker or ground control point the older tribrachs required a plumb line to allow them to be positioned vertically over a point and took longer to set up some modern total stations have an integral laser plummet built in the process is iterative between horizontal position and top plate level because they

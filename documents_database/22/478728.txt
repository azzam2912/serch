as of 2013 the pair had an angular separation of 20 0 arc seconds along a position angle of 82 together they are barely visible to the naked eye with a combined apparent visual magnitude of 6 21 based upon an annual parallax shift for both stars of approximately 16 5 mas as seen from earth this system is located roughly 198 light years from the sun the brighter member component a is a magnitude 6 70 f type star with a stellar classification of f7 iv v the luminosity class may indicate that at the age of 2 6 billion years it is beginning to evolve away from the main sequence it has an estimated 1 55 times the mass of the sun and is radiating 7 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6 325 k the magnitude 7 35 companion component b has 1 38 times the mass of the sun if the pair are gravitationally bound then their estimated orbital period is 27 000 years

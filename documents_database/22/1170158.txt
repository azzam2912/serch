these heavy chain disease proteins have various deletions mainly in their amino terminal part which causes the heavy chains to lose the ability to form disulfide bonds with the light chains the defect in the immunoglobulins presumably arises during somatic hypermutation deletion of the n terminal part of the heavy chain disease protein leads to aggregation and signaling of the b cell receptor presumably due to the loss of the anti aggregating properties of the light chain there are four forms the most common type of heavy chain disease is the iga type known as hcd the most common type of hcd is the gastrointestinal form known as immunoproliferative small intestine disease or ipsid but it has also been reported in the respiratory tract and other areas of the body franklin s disease gamma heavy chain disease it is a very rare b cell lymphoplasma cell proliferative disorder which may be associated with autoimmune diseases and infection is a common characteristic of the disease it is characterized by lymphadenopathy fever anemia malaise hepatosplenomegaly and weakness the most distinctive symptom is palatal edema caused by nodal involvement of waldeyer s ring diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an anomalous serum

the film stars mickey rooney as hart and tom drake as rodgers along with janet leigh betty garrett ann sothern and numerous musical stars it was the second in a series of mgm biopics about broadway composers it was preceded by till the clouds roll by jerome kern 1946 and followed by three little words kalmar and ruby 1950 and deep in my heart sigmund romberg 1954 the film is best remembered for featuring the final screen pairing between rooney and judy garland and for the lavish showcasing of the rodgers and hart catalogue of songs the script as in many similar films of the era was heavily fictionalized it sanitized hart s complex psychological problems and self destructive behavior which led to the break up of the writing partnership and contributed to hart s early death in keeping with cultural taboos of the time the film also completely ignored hart s homosexuality thanks to the same taboos the new york times reviewer bosley crowther ridiculed the film s inaccurate portrayal of hart but did not specify what was inaccurate the introduction to the film is staged as if composer richard rodgers were actually playing himself actor tom drake appears

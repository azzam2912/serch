cell division in streptococci occurs along a single axis so as they grow they tend to form pairs or chains that may appear bent or twisted contrast with that of staphylococci which divide along multiple axes thereby generating irregular grape like clusters of cells the term was coined in 1877 by viennese surgeon albert theodor billroth 1829 1894 by combining the prefix strepto from together with the suffix coccus from modern from most streptococci are oxidase negative and catalase negative and many are facultative anaerobes capable of growth both aerobically and anaerobically in 1984 many bacteria formerly grouped in the genus streptococcus were separated out into the genera enterococcus and lactococcus currently over 50 species are recognised in this genus this genus has been found to be part of the salivary microbiome in addition to streptococcal pharyngitis strep throat certain streptococcus species are responsible for many cases of pink eye meningitis bacterial pneumonia endocarditis erysipelas and necrotizing fasciitis the flesh eating bacterial infections however many streptococcal species are not pathogenic and form part of the commensal human microbiota of the mouth skin intestine and upper respiratory tract streptococci are also a necessary ingredient in producing emmentaler swiss cheese species of

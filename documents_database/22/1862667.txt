this small cluster of neurons also is referred to by the abbreviation pre lc it was named pre lc because it lies just rostral to in front of the locus coeruleus which is commonly abbreviated lc the pre locus coeruleus was first formally defined during the course of neuroanatomical tract tracing and c fos experiments aimed at uncovering the connections and functions of aldosterone sensitive hsd2 neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract first hsd2 neurons were found to innervate the pre lc as evidenced by 1 dense labeling with an anterograde axonal tracer in pre lc after that tracer had been injected into the nucleus of the solitary tract and 2 the complementary finding of retrograde labeling of hsd2 neurons after injection of a retrograde tracer into the pre lc further experimental conditions which activate the hsd2 neurons simultaneously activate a cluster of neurons in pre lc in the same location as axon terminals labeled with an anterograde tracer from the nts based on these observations the pre locus coeruleus pre lc was defined as the cluster of neurons which these features consistently and reliably identify a very specific subset of neurons in the dorsolateral pons named the

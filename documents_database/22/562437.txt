ucg is an in situ gasification process carried out in non mined coal seams using injection of oxidants and steam the product gas is brought to the surface through production wells drilled from the surface the predominant product gases are methane hydrogen carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide ratios vary depending upon formation pressure depth of coal and oxidant balance gas output may be combusted for electricity production alternatively the gas output can be used to produce synthetic natural gas or hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used as a chemical feedstock for the production of fuels e g diesel fertilizer explosives and other products the technique can be applied to coal resources that are otherwise unprofitable or technically complicated to extract by traditional mining methods ucg offers an alternative to conventional coal mining methods for some resources it has been linked to a number of concerns from environmental campaigners the earliest recorded mention of the idea of underground coal gasification was in 1868 when sir william siemens in his address to the chemical society of london suggested the underground gasification of waste and slack coal in the mine russian chemist dmitri mendeleyev further developed siemens idea over the next couple

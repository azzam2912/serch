a notable effect attenuation is to gradually reduce the intensity of light waves as they propagate through a medium although the absorption of waves does not usually depend on their intensity linear absorption in certain conditions optics the medium s transparency changes by a factor that varies as a function of wave intensity and saturable absorption or nonlinear absorption occurs many approaches can potentially quantify radiation absorption with key examples following all these quantities measure at least to some extent how well a medium absorbs radiation which among them practitioners use varies by field and technique often due simply to convention the absorbance of an object quantifies how much of the incident light is absorbed by it instead of being reflected or refracted this may be related to other properties of the object through the beer lambert law precise measurements of the absorbance at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via absorption spectroscopy where a sample is illuminated from one side and the intensity of the light that exits from the sample in every direction is measured a few examples of absorption are ultraviolet visible spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy and x ray absorption spectroscopy understanding and measuring the absorption

a memory cell typically consists of a single mosfet metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor thus multi level cells reduce the number of mosfets required to store the same amount of data as single level cells triple level cells tlc and quad level cells qlc are versions of mlc memory which can store 3 and 4 bits per cell respectively note that due to the convention the name multi level cell is sometimes used specifically to refer to the two level cell which is slightly confusing overall the memories are named as follows examples of mlc memories are mlc nand flash mlc pcm phase change memory etc for example in slc nand flash technology each cell can exist in one of the two states storing one bit of information per cell most mlc nand flash memory has four possible states per cell so it can store two bits of information per cell this reduces the amount of margin separating the states and results in the possibility of more errors multi level cells which are designed for low error rates are sometimes called enterprise mlc emlc there are tools for modeling the area latency energy of mlc memories new technologies such

given a matroid formula 1 the matroid polytope formula 2 is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the bases of formula 1 let formula 1 be a matroid on formula 5 elements given a basis formula 6 of formula 1 the indicator vector of formula 8 is where formula 10 is the standard formula 11th unit vector in formula 12 the matroid polytope formula 2 is the convex hull of the set the matroid independence polytope or independence matroid polytope is the convex hull of the set the basis matroid polytope is a face of the independence matroid polytope given the rank formula 58 of a matroid formula 21 the independence matroid polytope is equal to the polymatroid determined by formula 58 the flag matroid polytope is another polytope constructed from the bases of matroids a flag formula 61 is a strictly increasing sequence of finite sets let formula 63 be the cardinality of the set formula 64 two matroids formula 21 and formula 66 are said to be concordant if their rank functions satisfy given pairwise concordant matroids formula 68 on the ground set formula 50 with ranks formula 70 consider the collection of flags formula 71

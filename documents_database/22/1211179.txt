some urban wildlife such as house mice are synanthropic ecologically associated with humans some species or populations may become entirely dependent on humans for instance the range of many synanthropic species is expanded to latitudes at which they could not survive the winter outside of human settlements other species simply tolerate cohabiting with humans and using the remaining green spaces in some cases gradually becoming more accustomed to the new habitat over time and eventually synanthropic these species represent a minority of the creatures that would normally inhabit an area for example a 2014 compilation of studies found that only 8 of native bird and 25 of native plant species were present in urban areas compared with estimates of non urban density of species urban wildlife can be found at any latitude that supports human dwellings the list of animals that will search human trash within settlements runs from tropical monkeys to polar bears in the arctic different types of urban areas support different kinds of wildlife one general feature of bird species that adapt well to urban environments is they tend to be the species with bigger brains perhaps allowing them to be more adaptable to the changeable urban

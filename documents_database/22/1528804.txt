they were relatively large bodied feathered hypercarnivores with diets consisting almost entirely of other terrestrial vertebrates that flourished in the cretaceous period eudromaeosaur fossils are known almost exclusively from the northern hemisphere they first appeared in the early cretaceous period early aptian stage about 124 million years ago and survived until the end of the cretaceous maastrichtian stage ma the earliest known definitive eudromaeosaur is the dromaeosaurine utahraptor ostrommaysorum from the cedar mountain formation dated to 124 million years ago however the earlier 143 million year old fossils such as those of nuthetes destructor and several indeterminate teeth dating to the kimmeridgian stage may represent eudromaeosaurs while other dromaeosaurids filled a variety of specialized ecological niches mainly those of small predators or larger fish eating forms eudromaeosaurs functioned as large bodied predators of often medium to large sized prey aside from their generally larger size eudromaeosaurs are characterized by several features of the foot first there were differences in the positions of the grooves which anchored blood vessels and keratin sheathes of the toe claws in primitive dromaeosaurids like hesperonychus these grooves ran parallel to each other on either side of the claw along its length in eudromaeosaurs the grooves

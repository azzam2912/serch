it is a stochastic jump process with arbitrary distributions of jump lengths and waiting times more generally it can be seen to be a special case of a markov renewal process ctrw was introduced by montroll and weiss as a generalization of physical diffusion process to effectively describe anomalous diffusion i e the super and sub diffusive cases an equivalent formulation of the ctrw is given by generalized master equations a connection between ctrws and diffusion equations with fractional time derivatives has been established similarly time space fractional diffusion equations can be considered as ctrws with continuously distributed jumps or continuum approximations of ctrws on lattices a simple formulation of a ctrw is to consider the stochastic process formula 1 defined by whose increments formula 3 are iid random variables taking values in a domain formula 4 and formula 5 is the number of jumps in the interval formula 6 the probability for the process taking the value formula 7 at time formula 8 is then given by here formula 10 is the probability for the process taking the value formula 7 after formula 12 jumps and formula 13 is the probability of having formula 12 jumps after time formula

it can be done by hand usually using a hoe or with powered machinery typically a tractor attachment hilling buries the normally above ground part of the plant promoting desired growth this may encourage the development of additional tubers as with potatoes force the plant to grow longer stems leeks or for some crops chicory leeks asparagus etc this blanching technique keeps the stems or shoots pale and tender or influences their taste hilling may also be used to stabilize the stems of crops which are easily disturbed by wind a common application of hilling is for potatoes the tubers grow just below the surface and can produce chlorophyll and solanine if exposed to light green potatoes solanine is toxic in large doses and can result in nausea headache and in rare cases death by hilling one or more times during the growing season effectively burying the potatoes in an additional few inches of soil yield is improved and the harvest remains edible in vineyards at the beginning of the winter period

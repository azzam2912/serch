it exists in two main forms liquid high level waste is typically held temporarily in underground tanks pending vitrification most of the high level waste created by the manhattan project and the weapons programs of the cold war exists in this form because funding for further processing was typically not part of the original weapons programs both spent nuclear fuel and vitrified waste are considered as suitable forms for long term disposal after a period of temporary storage in the case of spent nuclear fuel hlw contains many of the fission products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core and is the type of nuclear waste with the highest activity hlw accounts for over 95 of the total radioactivity produced in the nuclear power process in other words while most nuclear waste is low level and intermediate level waste such as protective clothing and equipment that have been contaminated with radiation the majority of the radioactivity produced from the nuclear power generation process comes from high level waste in the us hlw from reprocessing of spent fuel from electrical power stations amounts to less than 1 of the total volume of us hlw the rest is defense related some

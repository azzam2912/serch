it was released on 8 november 2013 by abc music the album mostly consists of christmas classics such as silent night and o holy night but also includes cover versions of recent christmas pop songs by such as don t save it all for christmas day by c line dion and note to god by jojo ben ryan of renowned for sound gave the album 4 of out 5 saying if you pick this album up expect vocal gymnastics and expect lead footed vibrato callea is obviously an accomplished vocalist but for the greater part of the record there is just one level he sings at there is the occasional dynamic variation but for the most part the tunes are sung with incessant vigour he added the choir is a particularly appealing feature of this record there is great poignancy inherent in any well organised raft of young voices and employing them in a moving piece like ave maria almost guarantees some goose bumps the album debuted at number 60 on the aria chart but peaked at 47

there are two classical fuzzy retrieval models mixed min and max mmm and the paice model both models do not provide a way of evaluating query weights however this is considered by the p norms algorithm in fuzzy set theory an element has a varying degree of membership say d to a given set a instead of the traditional membership choice is an element is not an element in mmm each index term has a fuzzy set associated with it a document s weight with respect to an index term a is considered to be the degree of membership of the document in the fuzzy set associated with a the degree of membership for union and intersection are defined as follows in fuzzy set theory according to this documents that should be retrieved for a query of the form a or b should be in the fuzzy set associated with the union of the two sets a and b similarly the documents that should be retrieved for a query of the form a and b should be in the fuzzy set associated with the intersection of the two sets hence it is possible to define the similarity of a document

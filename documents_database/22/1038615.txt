the aircraft was developed during the latter half of the 1960s by the swiss federal construction works eidgenoessische konstruktionswerkstaette ekw renamed farner werke f w in 1972 as a conversion of the existing c 3603 ground attack target towing aircraft following a successful prototype conversion in 1968 23 aircraft were converted between 1971 1973 with 2 still flying in private hands in 1967 the swiss air force determined that their c 3603 1 target towing aircraft still had approximately 10 years of structural life remaining but that the plane s hispano suiza piston type engines were on the verge of wearing out with replacements becoming scarce the c 3603 1 was based on a world war ii era ground attack design which had been inspired by the design of the messerschmitt bf 109 evaluations of various types of foreign aircraft were conducted to find a replacement however it was determined in 1965 that the most economical solution would be to re engineer the existing aircraft with a modern turboprop engine accordingly work began under the direction of jean pierre weibel to convert the 102nd c 3603 into the prototype c 3605 the selected replacement engine was a lycoming t53 turboprop

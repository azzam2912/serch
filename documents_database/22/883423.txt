it makes use of a large database that also holds detailed curated information for all sequences of viruses viroids and satellites of plants fungi and protozoa that are complete or that contain at least one complete gene there are currently about 10 000 such sequences for comparative purposes dpvweb also contains a representative sequence of all other fully sequenced virus species with an rna or single stranded dna genome for each curated sequence the database contains the start and end positions of each feature gene non translated region etc and these have been checked for accuracy as far as possible the nomenclature for genes and proteins are standardized within genera and families sequences of features either as dna or amino acid sequences can be directly downloaded from the website in fasta format the sequence information can also be accessed via client software for personal computers the descriptions of plant viruses dpvs were first published by the association of applied biologists in 1970 as a series of leaflets each one written by an expert describing a particular plant virus in 1998 all of the 354 dpvs published in paper were scanned and converted into an electronic format in a database and

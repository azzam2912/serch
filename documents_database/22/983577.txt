it is 394 km long and was named after eug ne michael antoniadi a greek astronomer 1870 1944 who spent most of his life in france there is evidence that antoniadi crater once contained rivers and lakes the picture below shows an inverted channel in antoniadi as seen by hirise inverted channels formed from accumulated sediments that were cemented by minerals these channels eroded into the surface then the whole area was covered over with sediments when the sediments were later eroded away the place where the river channel existed remained because the hardened material were resistant to erosion some places on mars show inverted relief in these locations a stream bed may be a raised feature instead of a valley the inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation in either case erosion would erode the surrounding land and leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridge will be more resistant to erosion an image below taken with hirise of antoniadi crater shows sinuous ridges that are old channels that have become inverted inverted relief in the form of sinuous and meandering ridges which are indicative of

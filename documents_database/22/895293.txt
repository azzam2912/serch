the idea is based on iterated exponentiation in much the same way that exponentiation is iterated multiplication a regular exponential can be expressed as such however these expressions become arbitrarily large when dealing with systems such as knuth s up arrow notation take the following cutler s bar notation shifts these exponentials counterclockwise forming formula 3 a bar is placed above the variable to denote this change as such this system becomes effective with multiple exponents when regular denotation becomes too cumbersome the same pattern could be iterated a fourth time becoming formula 6 for this reason it is sometimes referred to as cutler s circular notation the cutler bar notation can be used to easily express other notation systems in exponent form it also allows for a flexible summarization of multiple copies of the same exponents where any number of stacked exponents can be shifted counterclockwise and shortened to a single variable the bar notation also allows for fairly rapid composure of very large numbers for instance the number formula 7 would contain more than a googolplex digits while remaining fairly simple to write with and remember however the system reaches a problem when dealing with different exponents in

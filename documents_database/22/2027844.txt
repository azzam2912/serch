the sznajd model implements a phenomenon called social validation and thus extends the ising spin model in simple words the model states for simplicity one assumes that each individual formula 1 has an opinion s which might be boolean formula 2 for no formula 3 for yes in its simplest formulation which means that each individual either agrees or disagrees to a given question in the original 1d formulation each individual has exactly two neighbors just like beads on a bracelet at each time step a pair of individual formula 4 and formula 5 is chosen at random to change their nearest neighbors opinion or ising spins formula 6 and formula 7 according to two dynamical rules in a closed 1 dimensional community two steady states are always reached namely complete consensus which is called ferromagnetic state in physics or stalemate the antiferromagnetic state furthermore monte carlo simulations showed that these simple rules lead to complicated dynamics in particular to a power law in the decision time distribution with an exponent of 1 5 the final antiferromagnetic state of alternating all on and all off is unrealistic to represent the behavior of a community it would mean that the complete

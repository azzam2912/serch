it is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4 61 the distance to this system as determined from an annual parallax shift of is about 129 light years it is moving closer to the sun with a heliocentric radial velocity of 6 6 km s this system was found to have a variable radial velocity by leah allen and adelaide hobe of lick observatory in 1911 it was identified as a single lined spectroscopic binary and the orbital elements were published by canadian astronomer w e harper in 1926 the pair have an orbital period of 72 93 days and an eccentricity of 0 27 this is a rs canum venaticorum variable indicating a close binary system with active star spots and has the variable star designation bc psc the primary component a is a first ascent red giant with a stellar classification of k0 iiib having chemical abundances that match a first dredge up mixing model pourbaix boffin 2003 estimated the mass of the primary as and the secondary as however feuillet et al 2016 derived a much lower mass estimate of for the primary at the age of roughly five billion years the

the first tube to incorporate a dynode was the dynatron an ancestor of the magnetron which used a single dynode photomultiplier and video camera tubes generally include a series of dynodes each at a more positive electrical potential than its predecessor secondary emission occurs at the surface of each dynode such an arrangement is able to amplify the tiny current emitted by the photocathode typically by a factor of one million the electrons emitted from the cathode are accelerated toward the first dynode which is maintained 90 to 100 v positive with respect to the cathode each accelerated photoelectron that strikes the dynode surface produces several electrons these electrons are then accelerated toward the second dynode held 90 to 100 v more positive than the first dynode and each electron that strikes the surface of the second dynode produces several more electrons which are then accelerated toward the third dynode and so on by the time this process has been repeated at each of the dynodes 10 to 10 electrons have been produced for each incident photon dependent on the number of dynodes for conventional dynode materials such as beo and mgo a multiplication factor of 10 can normally be

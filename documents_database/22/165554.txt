these measurements reflect blood volume changes and can indirectly indicate the presence or absence of venous thrombosis this procedure provides an alternative to venography which is invasive and requires a great deal of skill to execute adequately and interpret accurately for the chest the technique was developed by nasa to measure the split second impedance changes within the chest as the heart beats to calculate both cardiac output and lung water content this technique has progressed clinically often now called bioz i e biologic impedance as promoted by the leading manufacturer in the us and allows low cost non invasive estimations of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance using only 4 skin electrodes oscillometric blood pressure measurement and lung water volumes with minimal removal of clothing in physician offices having the needed equipment for leg veins the test measures blood volume in the lower leg due to temporary venous obstruction this is accomplished by inflating a pneumatic cuff around the thigh to sufficient pressure to cut off venous flow but not arterial flow causing the venous blood pressure to rise until it equals the pressure under the cuff when the cuff is released there is a rapid venous runoff and

these facilities enable a designer to simulate concurrent processes each described using plain c syntax systemc processes can communicate in a simulated real time environment using signals of all the datatypes offered by c some additional ones offered by the systemc library as well as user defined in certain respects systemc deliberately mimics the hardware description languages vhdl and verilog but is more aptly described as a system level modeling language systemc is applied to system level modeling architectural exploration performance modeling software development functional verification and high level synthesis systemc is often associated with electronic system level esl design and with transaction level modeling tlm systemc is defined and promoted by the open systemc initiative osci now accellera and has been approved by the ieee standards association as ieee 1666 2011 the systemc language reference manual lrm the lrm provides the definitive statement of the semantics of systemc osci also provide an open source proof of concept simulator sometimes incorrectly referred to as the reference simulator which can be downloaded from the osci website although it was the intent of osci that commercial vendors and academia could create original software compliant to ieee 1666 in practice most systemc implementations

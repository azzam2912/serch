members of this family have no capsid fungi serve as natural hosts there are currently seven species in this family divided among 2 genera the genome of these viruses is unipartate and between 2 3 and 3 5 kilobases in length it encodes a single gene the rna dependent rna polymerase this protein is associated with the genome in the cytoplasm of the host the viruses do not have a capsid or envelop and do not form any infectious viral particles except lipid vesicles they infect fungi including yeast and oomycetes mitovirues appear to be among the most common fungi viruses viral replication is cytoplasmic replication follows the positive stranded rna virus replication model positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription the virus exits the host cell by cell to cell movement fungi serve as the natural host transmission routes are parental and sexual two genera have been recognised to date mitoviruses infect the mitochondria of fungi while narnaviruses remain within the cytoplasm of the host cell group ssrna other proposed members of the mitovirus genus are onumv1c and onumv7 their closest relatives among rna viruses are plant infecting viruses of genus ourmiavirus which however have a

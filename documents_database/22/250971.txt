the disjunction property is satisfied by a theory if whenever a sentence a b is a theorem then either a is a theorem or b is a theorem the existence property or witness property is satisfied by a theory if whenever a sentence is a theorem where a x has no other free variables then there is some term t such that the theory proves rathjen 2005 lists five properties that a theory may possess these include the disjunction property dp the existence property ep and three additional properties these properties can only be directly expressed for theories that have the ability to quantify over natural numbers and for cr quantify over functions from formula 12 to formula 12 in practice one may say that a theory has one of these properties if a definitional extension of the theory has the property stated above rathjen 2005 kurt g del 1932 stated without proof that intuitionistic propositional logic with no additional axioms has the disjunction property this result was proven and extended to intuitionistic predicate logic by gerhard gentzen 1934 1935 stephen cole kleene 1945 proved that heyting arithmetic has the disjunction property and the existence property kleene s method introduced

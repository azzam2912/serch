eves may be entire viral genomes proviruses or fragments of viral genomes they arise when a viral dna sequence becomes integrated into the genome of a germ cell that goes on to produce a viable organism the newly established eve can be inherited from one generation to the next as an allele in the host species and may even reach fixation endogenous retroviruses and other eves that occur as proviruses can potentially remain capable of producing infectious virus in their endogenous state replication of such active endogenous viruses can lead to the proliferation of viral insertions in the germline for most non retroviral viruses germline integration appears to be a rare anomalous event and the resulting eves are often only fragments of the parent virus genome such fragments are usually not capable of producing infectious virus but may express protein or rna and even cell surface receptors eves have been identified in animals plants and fungi in vertebrates eves derived from retroviruses endogenous retroviruses are relatively common because retroviruses integrate into the nuclear genome of the host cell as an inherent part of their replication cycle they are predisposed to enter the host germline in addition eves related to parvoviruses

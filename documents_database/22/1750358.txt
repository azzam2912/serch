it is found living on the seabed in the waters around antarctica it has been used as a model organism in the fields of reproductive biology embryology ecology physiology and toxicology the mitochondrial dna of the antarctic sea urchin and several other urchins found in the circumpolar region was examined in order to assess their phylogenetic relationships it was found that sterechinus neumayeri was most closely related to paracentrotus lividus and loxechinus albus both of which are found in the southernmost part of south america the divergence of the three species began 35 to 25 million years ago which coincides with the period at which antarctica became separated from south america the antarctic sea urchin ranges in color from bright red to dull purple and can grow to in diameter the test is globular with vertical rows of long strong white tipped spines between which there is a dense covering of smaller spines and vertical rows of tube feet the spines and tube feet enable the animal to move across the ground there are often fragments of red algae adhering to the spines the antarctic sea urchin is found in circumpolar waters including the southern ocean the balleny islands south

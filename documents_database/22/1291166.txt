amnon was the chief of staff of israel s military and hani was one of yasser arafat s right hand men the filmmakers worked exhaustingly to organize this unofficial meeting between two powerful people who have more in common than might be expected we ve worked on this handshake for more than a year the filmmaker says as amnon enters the room and greets hani this is the first time that the two leaders have met face to face but it s not the first time they ve come in contact with each other in 1968 amnon led an israeli offensive that faced palestinian guerrilla soldiers led by hani and in 1973 both men were in beirut during israel s raid on lebanon now instead of interacting from behind guns the two sit comfortably in an air conditioned room talking over finely prepared meals and red wine but instead of staying fixed in the conference room the film offers a glimpse into amnon and hani s personal lives to expose the roots of their political beliefs breaking from his discussions with amnon hani goes to visit his childhood home in haifa which has now become the holy site of elija

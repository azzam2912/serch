it has schl fli symbol of t 8 4 a secondary construction t 8 8 is called a truncated octaoctagonal tiling with two colors of hexakaidecagons there are two uniform constructions of this tiling first by the 8 4 kaleidoscope and second by removing the last mirror 8 4 1 gives 8 8 882 the dual of the tiling represents the fundamental domains of 882 orbifold symmetry from 8 8 symmetry there are 15 small index subgroup by mirror removal and alternation operators mirrors can be removed if its branch orders are all even and cuts neighboring branch orders in half removing two mirrors leaves a half order gyration point where the removed mirrors met in these images unique mirrors are colored red green and blue and alternatedly colored triangles show the location of gyration points the 8 8 44 subgroup has narrow lines representing glide reflections the subgroup index 8 group 1 8 1 8 1 4444 is the commutator subgroup of 8 8 one larger subgroup is constructed as 8 8 removing the gyration points of 8 4 index 16 becomes 44444444 and its direct subgroup 8 8 index 32 44444444 the 8 8 symmetry can be doubled

the formation of native disulfide bonds play an important role in the proper folding of proteins and stabilize tertiary structures of the protein dsbc is one of 6 proteins in the dsb family in prokaryotes the other proteins are dsba dsbb dsbd dsbe and dsbg these enzymes work in tandem with each other to form disulfide bonds during the expression of proteins dsbc and dsbg act as proofreaders of the disulfide bonds that are formed they break non native disulfide bonds that were formed and act as chaperones for the formation of native disulfide bonds the isomerization of disulfide bonds occurs in the periplasm dsba dsbc and dsbg have a common cys xxx xxx cys cys cysteine motif in their active site where xxx can be any amino acid in the periplasm dsba oxidizes thiols in cysteines to form disulfide bonds in proteins dsba receives its oxidizing potential from the cytosol through dsbb however the probability of forming a non native disulfide bond increases with the number of cysteines in the protein sequence this leads to improperly folded proteins dsbc and dsbg facilitate the proper folding of the protein by breaking non native disulfide bonds in addition to this dsbc

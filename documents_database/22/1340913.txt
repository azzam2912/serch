a non reversing mirror can be made by connecting two regular mirrors at their edges at a 90 degree angle if the join is positioned so that it is vertical an observer looking into the angle will see a non reversed image this can be seen in places such as public toilets when there are two mirrors mounted on walls which meet at right angles such an image is visible while looking towards the corner where the two mirrors meet the problem with this type of non reversing mirror is that there is usually a line down the middle interrupting the image however if first surface mirrors are used and care is taken to set the angle to exactly 90 degrees the join can be made almost invisible another type of non reversing mirror can be made by making the mirror concave curved inwards like a bowl at a certain distance from the mirror a non reversed image will appear the disadvantage of this is that it only works at a certain distance a third type of non reversing mirror was created by mathematics professor r andrew hicks in 2009 it was created using computer algorithms to generate a disco

it originally was made for tandy s trs dos operating system and for their trs 80 line of computers but eventually shifted to pc where it was developed using c and assembly like windows and other competitors from the time such as gem it was not a full operating system requiring a separate disk operating system in order to function although the initial pc ports would only run on tandy s pcs such as the tandy 1000 the introduction of the true pc compatible computers such as the tandy 3000 resulted in the software later being made available for other compatibles some non tandy software used deskmate to provide the user interface and provided a runtime version of the operating environment for those without it examples included activision s the music studio and a version of lotus 1 2 3 deskmate version 1 0 was included with the original tandy 1000 and did not work correctly on non tandy computers this was mainly due to the use of the function keys as most non tandy pcs either did not come with an f12 button or with one that did not act in the same way as a tandy f12 function

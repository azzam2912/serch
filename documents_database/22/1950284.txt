the purpose of these instruction sets is to improve the speed of bit manipulation all the instructions in these sets are non simd and operate only on general purpose registers there are two sets published by intel bmi here referred to as bmi1 and bmi2 they were both introduced with the haswell microarchitecture another two sets were published by amd abm advanced bit manipulation which is also a subset of sse4a implemented by intel as part of sse4 2 and bmi1 and tbm trailing bit manipulation an extension introduced with piledriver based processors as an extension to bmi1 but dropped again in zen based processors abm is only implemented as a single instruction set by amd all amd processors support both instructions or neither intel considers codice 1 as part of sse4 2 and codice 2 as part of bmi1 codice 1 has a separate cpuid flag however intel uses amd s codice 4 flag to indicate codice 2 support since codice 2 completes the abm codice 2 is almost identical to the bit scan reverse codice 8 instruction but sets the zf if the result is zero and cf if the source is zero flags rather than of and

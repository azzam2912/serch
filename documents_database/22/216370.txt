haag s original proof was subsequently generalized by a number of authors notably dick hall and arthur wightman who reached the conclusion that a single universal hilbert space representation does not suffice for describing both free and interacting fields in 1975 michael c reed and barry simon proved that a haag like theorem also applies to free neutral scalar fields of different masses which implies that the interaction picture cannot exist even under the absence of interactions in its modern form the haag theorem may be stated as follows consider two faithful representations of the canonical commutation relations ccr formula 1 and formula 2 where formula 3 denote the respective hilbert spaces and formula 4 the collection of operators in the ccr the two representations are called unitarily equivalent if and only if there exists some unitary mapping formula 5 from hilbert space formula 6 to hilbert space formula 7 such that for j formula 8 unitary equivalence is a necessary condition for both representations to deliver the same expectation values of the corresponding observables haag s theorem states that if the two representations are unitarily equivalent representations of scalar fields and both representations contain a unique vacuum state the

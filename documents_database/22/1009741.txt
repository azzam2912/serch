a pressurant is used such as steam or pressurized helium to drive the fluid through the pump nasa have developed a low cost rocket fuel pump which has comparable performance to turbopump at 80 90 lower cost perhaps the most difficult barrier to entry in the liquid rocket business is the turbo pump a turbo pump design requires a large engineering effort and is expensive to manufacture and test starting a turbo pump fed rocket engine is a complex process requiring a careful synchronisation of many valves and subsystems in fact beal aerospace tried to avoid the issue entirely by building a huge pressure feed booster their booster never flew but the engineering behind it was sound and if they had a low cost pump at their disposal they might be competing against boeing this pump saves up to 90 of the mass of the tanks as compared to a pressure fed system this pump has really proved to be a boon for rockets by using this pump the rocket does not have to carry such a heavy load and can travel with very high speed the cycle is as follows rocket engines requires a tremendous amount of fuel at

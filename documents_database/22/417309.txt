in digital audio transmissions this saves bandwidth of the communications channel by transmitting nothing when the source volume is under a certain threshold leaving only louder sounds such as the speaker s voice to be sent however improvements in background noise reduction technologies can occasionally result in the complete removal of all noise although maximizing call quality is of primary importance exhaustive removal of noise may not properly simulate the typical behavior of terminals on the pstn system the result of receiving total silence especially for a prolonged period has a number of unwanted effects on the listener including the following to counteract these effects comfort noise is added usually on the receiving end in wireless or voip systems to fill in the silent portions of transmissions with artificial noise the noise generated is at a low but audible volume level and can vary based on the average volume level of received signals to minimize jarring transitions in many voip products users may control how vad and comfort noise are configured or disable the feature entirely as part of the rtp audio video profile rfc 3389 defines a standard for distributing comfort noise information in voip systems a similar concept

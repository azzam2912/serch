light gaps form predominantly when a tree falls and thus produces an opening in the forest canopy light gaps are important for maintaining diversity in species rich ecosystems there are many ways in which light gaps can form a major occurrence is through previously mentioned treefall gaps the death of a full grown tree initiates a treefall gap where light is exposed to the soil and creates resources for seeds and younger trees treefall gaps have been proven to maintain tree diversity by increasing stem density which in turn can lead to species richness juvenile stems or saplings do an exceptional job at increasing stem density which increases species diversity as a result species compete for resources in order to regenerate succession can begin when treefall occurs because the newly lit area provides an area for a new population to grow trees that will grow in a treefall gap are not necessarily the most suited for that particular environment but rather grow by chance therefore different organisms may experience a greater attraction to certain environments over others which can also have an effect on the extent to which an area flourishes an interesting example of gap formation comes from japanese

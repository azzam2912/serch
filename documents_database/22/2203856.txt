the rhizome scales are red brown of uniform color and usually glossy they have unbranched red brown hairs on their edges hairs where present are unbranched and branched and brown in color the leaf blades are usually pinnate in cutting rarely pinnatifid or bipinnatifid bearing free veins which lack hydathodes at their terminus sori are borne in two rows beneath pinnae or lobes the sori are circular to elliptic in shape the sporangia either lack hairs or have one to two red brown hairs the genus was first described by barbara parris in 2007 to receive some of the species of the genus grammitis which as then circumscribed was artificial and contained a number of disparate lineages the name dasygrammitis means shaggy grammitis referring to the shaggy hairs often present on the frond in this group of former grammitis species parris placed six species in the genus a phylogenetic study of the grammitids found that dasygrammitis was sister to a clade consisting of calymmodon micropolypodium scleroglossum tomophyllum and xiphopterella these six genera share a radially symmetric rhizome which may be a synapomorphy for this clade although the trait appears in other grammitid taxa probably independently

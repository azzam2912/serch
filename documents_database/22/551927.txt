this means that for any residue class formula 6 there are coefficients formula 7 such that the restriction of the mapping formula 4 to the set formula 9 is given by residue class wise affine groups are countable and they are accessible to computational investigations many of them act multiply transitively on formula 1 or on subsets thereof a particularly basic type of residue class wise affine permutations are the class transpositions given disjoint residue classes formula 12 and formula 13 the corresponding class transposition is the permutation of formula 1 which interchanges formula 15 and formula 16 for every formula 17 and which fixes everything else here it is assumed that formula 18 and that formula 19 the set of all class transpositions of formula 1 generates a countable simple group which has the following properties it is straightforward to generalize the notion of a residue class wise affine group to groups acting on suitable rings other than formula 1 though only little work in this direction has been done so far see also the collatz conjecture which is an assertion about a surjective but not injective residue class wise affine mapping

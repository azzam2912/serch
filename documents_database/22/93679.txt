it is a key plot development in j r r tolkien s legendarium elrond at his council makes comparison to the last alliance of elves and men of the second age in the lord of the rings saying i remember well the splendour of their banners it recalled to me the glory of the elder days and the hosts of beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembled and yet not so many nor so fair as when thangorodrim was broken in the tale of the years it is called the great battle and the army the host of valinor the best known and most poetical account is in the silmarillion itself closely drawn from the earlier quenta silmarillion the most detailed account of the course of the war is in the later annals of beleriand other accounts and fragmentary details about the war are scattered appearing in the earliest versions of the legendarium the experience of distance to the war of wrath is greatest in the lord of the rings drawing nearer to it in the silmarillion closer still in the annals and quentas of the history of middle earth and closest in aspects in the lost tales

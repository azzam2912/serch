the beta angle determines the percentage of time that a satellite in low earth orbit leo spends in direct sunlight absorbing solar energy the term is defined as the angle between the orbital plane of the satellite and the vector to the sun i e the direction from which the sun is shining the beta angle is the smaller of the two angles between the sun vector and the plane of the object s orbit the beta angle does not define a unique orbital plane all satellites in orbit with a given beta angle at a given altitude have the same exposure to the sun even though they may be orbiting in completely different planes around earth the beta angle varies between 90 and 90 and the direction in which the satellite orbits its primary body determines whether the beta angle sign is positive or negative an imaginary observer standing on the sun defines a beta angle as positive if the satellite in question orbits in a counterclockwise direction and negative if it revolves clockwise the maximum amount of time that a satellite in a normal leo mission can spend in earth s shadow occurs at a beta angle of

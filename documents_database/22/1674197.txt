that experiment together with a similar one by t s k opened the way to the study of the dynamics of dislocations in solids those were also the first experiments of anelasticity in solids a branch of physics studying defects excitations and phase transitions in condensed matter first systematised by clarence zener he received the degree in electrotechnical engineering at the sapienza university of rome in 1937 following the steps of his father ugo bordoni engineering professor in the same faculty after whom the fondazione ugo bordoni was named in italy established in 1952 for supporting research and applications of telecommunications his interest in acoustics was first aroused still a student in 1936 by the invitation to join the newly founded institute of ultracoustics later of electroacoustics and then of acoustics of consiglio nazionale delle ricerche cnr then directed by orso mario corbino during the second world war he was initially in the aeronautics and head of the laboratory of electroacoustics in guidonia where he worked at acoustically triggered torpedoes for the navy in 1944 he became researcher of the institute of ultracoustics in 1947 8 he obtained a fellowship from cnr to stay 8 months at the massachusetts institute

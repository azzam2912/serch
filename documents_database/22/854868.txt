firearms companies everywhere were trying to achieve a type of practical light and cheap ammunition micro caliber less than 5mm 20 caliber ammunition makers wished to achieve high velocity flat trajectory and good penetration while keeping weight and recoil low so as to facilitate controllable use in individual automatic weapons the 4 5mm mkr was essentially a 22 wmr rimfire case necked down from 5 6mm to accept a 4 5mm bullet for use in the interdynamics mkr rifle and carbine it would be supplied in single use 50 round polymer magazines the cartridge featured a curved taper of its body to aid extraction and a short shoulderless neck its 4 5mm caliber boat tail spitzer bullet was 22mm long and made by cold rolling solid copper wire the lightweight bullet of 1 58 grams 24 4 grains reportedly achieved a muzzle velocity of about 1 000 m sec 3 270 ft sec and a muzzle energy of 790 joules 583 ft lbs this contrasts sharply with the comparable more modern 17 hmr which has a muzzle energy of 790 joule 250 ft lbs due to the combination of a thin walled rimfire case with a high pressure powder charge

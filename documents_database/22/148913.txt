this group lies in the d block of the periodic table the group itself has not acquired a trivial name it belongs to the broader grouping of the transition metals the three group 4 elements that occur naturally are titanium zirconium and hafnium the first three members of the group share similar properties all three are hard refractory metals under standard conditions however the fourth element rutherfordium rf has been synthesized in the laboratory none of its isotopes have been found occurring in nature all isotopes of rutherfordium are radioactive so far no experiments in a supercollider have been conducted to synthesize the next member of the group either unpenthexium uph element 156 or unpentoctium upo element 158 and it is unlikely that they will be synthesized in the near future like other groups the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group the chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium zirconium and hafnium all the elements of the group are

whereas the size may vary from rack to container a micro data center may include fewer than four servers in a single 19 inch rack it may come with built in security systems cooling systems and fire protection typically there are standalone rack level systems containing all the components of a traditional data center including in rack cooling power supply power backup security fire and suppression designs exist where energy is conserved by means of temperature chaining in combination with liquid cooling in mid 2017 technology introduced by the dome project was demonstrated enabling 64 high performance servers storage networking power and cooling to be integrated in a 2u 19 rack unit this packaging sometimes called datacenter in a box allows deployments in spaces where traditional data centers do not fit such as factory floors iot and dense city centers especially for edge computing and edge analytics mdcs are typically portable and provide plug and play features they can be rapidly deployed indoors or outdoors in remote locations for a branch office or for temporary use in high risk zones they enable distributed workloads minimizing downtime and increasing speed of response

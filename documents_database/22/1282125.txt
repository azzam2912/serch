its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 45 and an inclination of 3 with respect to the ecliptic the body s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at mauna kea in 1999 neptune has a semi major axis of 30 au and has a semi major axis of 32 au the minor planet center mpc does not classify this object as a centaur because the mpc defines centaurs as having a semi major axis of less than 30 066 au crosses the orbits of both neptune and uranus and has an inclination of only 2 62 the deep ecliptic survey des defines centaurs using a dynamical classification scheme based on the behavior of orbital integrations over 10 million years the des defines centaurs as nonresonant objects whose osculating perihelia are less than the osculating semimajor axis of neptune at any time during the integration using the dynamical definition of a centaur is a centaur in july 2009 a rotational lightcurve of was obtained from photometric observations lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 9 26 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0 11 magnitude the period however is ambiguous with alternative solutions 13 4 and 15 45 hours

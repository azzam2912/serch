the subtle difference in the name comes from the latin roots of english with inter meaning between or among and intra meaning inside chemical bonds are considered to be intramolecular forces for example these forces are often stronger than intermolecular forces which are present between atoms or molecules that are not bonded the classical model identifies three main types of chemical bonds ionic covalent and metallic distinguished by the degree of charge separation between participating atoms the characteristics of the bond formed can be predicted by the properties of constituent atoms namely electronegativity they differ in the magnitude of their bond enthalpies a measure of bond strength and thus affect the physical and chemical properties of compounds in different ways of ionic character is directly proportional difference in electronegitivity of bonded atom an ionic bond can be approximated as complete transfer of one or more valence electrons of atoms participating in bond formation resulting in a positive ion and a negative ion bound together by electrostatic forces electrons in an ionic bond tend to be mostly found around one of the two constituent atoms due to the large electronegativity difference between the two atoms greater difference in electronegativity results in

it is the layer 2 protocol for ibm s systems network architecture sna sdlc supports multipoint links as well as error correction it also runs under the assumption that an sna header is present after the sdlc header sdlc was mainly used by ibm mainframe and midrange systems however implementations exist on many platforms from many vendors the use of sdlc and sna is becoming more and more rare mostly replaced by ip based protocols or being tunneled through ip using anynet or other technologies in the united states sdlc can be found in traffic control cabinets in 1975 ibm developed the first bit oriented protocol sdlc from work done for ibm in the early 1970s this de facto standard has been adopted by iso as high level data link control hdlc in 1979 and by ansi as advanced data communication control procedures adccp the latter standards added features such as the asynchronous balanced mode frame sizes that did not need to be multiples of bit octets but also removed some of the procedures and messages such as the test message sdlc operates independently on each communications link and can operate on point to point multipoint or loop facilities on

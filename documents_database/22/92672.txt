the system is maintained and developed by the mizar project formerly under the direction of its founder andrzej trybulec in 2009 the mizar mathematical library was the largest coherent body of strictly formalized mathematics in existence the mizar project was started around 1973 by andrzej trybulec as an attempt to reconstruct mathematical vernacular so it can be checked by a computer its current goal apart from the continual development of the mizar system is the collaborative creation of a large library of formally verified proofs covering most of the core of modern mathematics this is in line with the influential qed manifesto currently the project is developed and maintained by research groups at bia ystok university poland the university of alberta canada and shinshu university japan while the mizar proof checker remains proprietary the mizar mathematical library the sizable body of formalized mathematics that it verified is licensed open source papers related to the mizar system regularly appear in the peer reviewed journals of the mathematic formalization academic community these include studies in logic grammar and rhetoric intelligent computer mathematics interactive theorem proving journal of automated reasoning and the journal of formalized reasoning the distinctive feature of the mizar language

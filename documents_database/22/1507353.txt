the galaxy is located at a distance of about 140 kpc from the sun and moves away from the sun with a velocity of about 45 km s it is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy dsph it has a noticeably elongated ratio of axes 3 1 shape with a half light radius of about 350 pc this elongation may be caused by tidal forces acting from the milky way galaxy meaning that her is being tidally disrupted now her also shows some gradient of velocities across the galaxy s body and is embedded into a faint stellar stream which also points towards its ongoing tidal disruption her is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the milky way its integrated luminosity is about 30 000 times that of the sun absolute visible magnitude of about 6 6 which is comparable to the luminosity of a typical globular cluster however its total mass is about 7 million solar masses which means the galaxy s mass to light ratio is around 330 a high mass to light ratio implies that her is dominated by dark matter the stellar population of her consists mainly of old stars formed more than 12

sinad is usually expressed in db and is quoted alongside the receiver rf sensitivity to give a quantitative evaluation of the receiver sensitivity note that with this definition unlike snr a sinad reading can never be less than 1 i e it is always positive when quoted in db when calculating the distortion it is common to exclude the dc components due to widespread use sinad has collected several different definitions sinad is commonly defined as information on the relations between sinad enob snr thd and sfdr can be found in a typical example quoted from a commercial hand held vhf or uhf radio might be this is stating that the receiver will produce intelligible speech with a signal at its input as low as 0 25 v radio receiver designers will test the product in a laboratory using a procedure which is typically as follows according to the radio designer intelligible speech can be detected 12 db above the receiver s noise floor noise and distortion regardless of how accurate this output power is regarding intelligible speech having a standard output sinad allows easy comparison between radio receiver input sensitivities this 0 25 v value is typical for vhf

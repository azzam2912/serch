calculation of this polynomial yields the eigenvalues of as its roots as a matrix polynomial in the matrix itself it vanishes by the fundamental cayley hamilton theorem calculating determinants however is computationally cumbersome whereas this efficient algorithm is computationally significantly more efficient in nc complexity class the algorithm has been independently rediscovered several times in some form or another it was first published in 1840 by urbain le verrier subsequently redeveloped by p horst jean marie souriau in its present form here by faddeev and sominsky and further by j s frame and others for historical points see householder an elegant shortcut to the proof bypassing newton polynomials was introduced by hou the bulk of the presentation here follows gantmacher p 88 the objective is to calculate the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix where evidently 1 and 1 det the coefficients are determined recursively from the top down by dint of the auxiliary matrices thus etc observe terminates the recursion at this could be used to obtain the inverse or the determinant of the proof relies on the modes of the adjugate matrix the auxiliary matrices encountered this matrix is defined by and is thus proportional to

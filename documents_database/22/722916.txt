they are frequently found in star shaped colonies of individuals asterionella average cell size is 60 85 micrometers long and 2 4 micrometers wide it forms colonies that often consist of eight cells but can vary up to 20 cells the cells in the colony are attached by the apex by extracellular matter by the way the cells are attached to each other the colonies often look like stars or spiralling chains the silica skeleton of a diatom cell called the frustule consists of an epitheca and an hypotheca the hypotheca is slightly smaller than the epitheca during asexual reproduction both thecae form the epitheca of the new daughter cell and each daughter produces a new hypotheca therefore one daughter cell is always smaller than the original cell in order to regain their original size it is usually assumed diatoms have to reproduce sexually although this has not yet been observed in a formosa however there may also be other ways to rejuvenate asterionella formosa is known to be susceptible to the chytrid fungus zygorhizidium planktonicum if a chytrid attaches to an asterionella cell they can however protect others of their kind by committing apoptosis or cellular suicide stopping the

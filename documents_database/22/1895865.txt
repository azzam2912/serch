for instance these are gauge theory of dislocations in continuous media when formula 2 the generalization of metric affine gravitation theory when formula 1 is a world manifold and in particular gauge theory of the fifth force being a vector bundle the tangent bundle formula 4 of an formula 5 dimensional manifold formula 1 admits a natural structure of an affine bundle formula 7 called the affine tangent bundle possessing bundle atlases with affine transition functions it is associated to a principal bundle formula 8 of affine frames in tangent space over formula 1 whose structure group is a general affine group formula 10 the tangent bundle formula 4 is associated to a principal linear frame bundle formula 12 whose structure group is a general linear group formula 13 this is a subgroup of formula 10 so that the latter is a semidirect product of formula 13 and a group formula 16 of translations there is the canonical imbedding of formula 12 to formula 8 onto a reduced principal subbundle which corresponds to the canonical structure of a vector bundle formula 4 as the affine one given linear bundle coordinates on the tangent bundle formula 4 the affine tangent bundle

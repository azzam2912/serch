the mizos are a tribal hill peoples in the indian state of mizoram and its neighboring areas all mizo tribes and clans in their folk legends claim that chhinlung sinlung khul which means cave in the mizo language was the cradle of the mizos thus it s sometimes concluded that the mizo people lived as cave dwellers at some point the present indian state of mizoram literally mizoland was called the lushai hills or lushai district and was defined as an excluded area during the british raj and a district of assam in independent india the people of the lushai hills demanded a distinct political territory when india achieved independence due to continued efforts by its people to gain autonomy the national government approved mizoram in 1972 as a union territory and in 1987 as a full fledged state of the republic of india as the people organized they chose to identify as mizo rather than by individual clan tribe names thus there is no mizo tribe as such rather an umbrella name for all the different tribes however unfortunately there still are some groups who refuse to be termed mizo and caused minor conflicts between the two these groups

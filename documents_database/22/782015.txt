the system has relative low installment costs and low operation and maintenance requirements the process uses air as a carrier gas that transfers water vapor from ascending evaporative channels to adjacent descending dew forming channels heat flowing through the barrier allows the evaporative energy requirement to be fully satisfied by the heat released by condensation on the dew forming side a small pressure difference is held so that the condensing cooler air is kept on the cool side near atmospheric operation permits corrosion free and scale resistant polypropylene construction and also allows the use of low grade heat to drive the process the process is proprietary developed by dr james r beckman currently altela inc albuquerque nm is manufacturing this technology under the altelarain trade name according to the bureau of reclamation a branch of the us department of interior this process uses simple corrugated plastic tanks with many dewvaporation columns inserted in each tank each column is made of corrugated plastic and is divided into two compartments the wall in the middle serves for receiving and evaporating sea water into a hot air stream and on the other side for condensing freshwater the cooling from the evaporation helps water

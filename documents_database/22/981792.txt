the other major site of adult neurogenesis is the subventricular zone svz in the brain the subgranular zone is a narrow layer of cells located between the granule cell layer and hilus of the dentate gyrus this layer is characterized by several types of cells the most prominent type being neural stem cells nscs in various stages of development however in addition to nscs there are also astrocytes endothelial cells blood vessels and other components which form a microenvironment that supports the nscs and regulates their proliferation migration and differentiation the discovery of this complex microenvironment and its crucial role in nsc development has led some to label it as a neurogenic niche it is also frequently referred to as a vascular or angiogenic niche due to the importance and pervasiveness of the blood vessels in the sgz the brain comprises many different types of neurons but the sgz generates only one type granule cells the primary excitatory neurons in the dentate gyrus dg which are thought to contribute to cognitive functions such as memory and learning the progression from neural stem cell to granule cell in the sgz can be described by tracing the following lineage of cell types

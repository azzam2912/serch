it is always within a constant factor of the logarithm of the given integer for instance the number 11 may be represented using eight ones however it has no representation using seven or fewer ones therefore its complexity is eight the complexities of the numbers 1 2 3 are the smallest numbers with complexity 1 2 3 are the question of expressing integers in this way was originally considered by they asked for the largest number with a given complexity later selfridge showed that this number is for example when and the largest integer that can be expressed using ten ones is its expression is thus the complexity of an integer is at least the complexity of is at most approximately an expression of this length for can be found by applying horner s method to the binary representation of almost all integers have a representation whose length is bounded by a logarithm with a smaller constant factor the complexities of all integers up to some threshold can be calculated in total time algorithms for computing the integer complexity have been used to disprove several conjectures about the complexity in particular it is not necessarily the case that the optimal

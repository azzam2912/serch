the radios which are similar to other walkie talkies use the part 15 low power communication 915 mhz band and employ frequency hopping spread spectrum fm technology to attempt to address some of the perceived shortcomings of family radio service frs radios since the frequency in use is rapidly changed in a pattern defined by the channel number transmissions cannot be monitored by commercially available radio scanners the radios hop on 50 actual frequencies from a pool of 700 giving ten billion unique frequency hopping pattern combinations known as channels due to the extremely high number of available channels users are unlikely to encounter others on the same channel and malicious interference is unlikely unless the interferer knows the channel number being used trisquare claims that reliable communications can be maintained with up to 100 000 users in range of each other this is in contrast to regular frs or gmrs radios which only permit 14 or 22 users to transmit simultaneously one user per frequency in range of each other even with privacy codes or pl tones that simply prevent one user on a channel from hearing another on the same channel but do nothing to prevent interference the

the pathway is triggered when the c3b protein directly binds a microbe it can also be triggered by foreign materials and damaged tissues this change in shape allows the binding of plasma protein factor b which allows factor d to cleave factor b into ba and bb bb remains bound to c3 ho to form c3 ho bb this complex is also known as a fluid phase c3 convertase this convertase the alternative pathway c3 convertase although only produced in small amounts can cleave multiple c3 proteins into c3a and c3b the complex is believed to be unstable until it binds properdin a serum protein the addition of properdin forms the complex c3bbbp a stable compound which can bind an additional c3b to form alternative pathway c5 convertase the c5 convertase of the alternative pathway consists of c3b bbp sometimes referred to as c3bbb after the creation of c5 convertase either as c3b bbp or c4b2a3b from the classical pathway the complement system follows the same path regardless of the means of activation alternative classical or lectin c5 convertase cleaves c5 into c5a and c5b c5b binds sequentially to c6 c7 c8 and then to multiple molecules of c9 to

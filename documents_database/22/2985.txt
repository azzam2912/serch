it is usually applied to an installation file after it is received from the download server by themselves checksums are often used to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data authenticity the actual procedure which yields the checksum from a data input is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm depending on its design goals a good checksum algorithm will usually output a significantly different value even for small changes made to the input this is especially true of cryptographic hash functions which may be used to detect many data corruption errors and verify overall data integrity if the computed checksum for the current data input matches the stored value of a previously computed checksum there is a very high probability the data has not been accidentally altered or corrupted checksum functions are related to hash functions fingerprints randomization functions and cryptographic hash functions however each of those concepts has different applications and therefore different design goals for instance a function returning the start of a string can provide a hash appropriate for some applications but will never be a suitable checksum checksums are used as cryptographic primitives in larger authentication algorithms for cryptographic systems with

the analogy is to that of construction on greenfield land where there is no need to work within the constraints of existing buildings or infrastructure in software development a greenfield project could be one of developing a system for a totally new environment without concern for integrating with other systems especially not legacy systems such projects are deemed as higher risk as they are often for new infrastructure new customers and even new owners for this reason agile software development is often deemed the best approach as it proposes how to handle those risks by developing small slices of complete functionality and getting them in the hands of customers internal or external quickly for immediate feedback in wireless engineering a greenfield project could be that of rolling out a new generation of cell phone networks the first cellular telephone networks were built primarily on tall existing tower structures or on high ground in an effort to cover as much territory as possible in as little time as possible and with a minimum number of base stations these early wireless telephone network designs were later augmented with additional base stations and antennas to handle the growing demand for additional voice traffic

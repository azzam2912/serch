the jamming transition has been proposed as a new type of phase transition with similarities to a glass transition but very different from the formation of crystalline solids while a glass transition occurs when the liquid state is cooled the jamming transition happens when density is increased this crowding of the constituent particles prevents them from exploring phase space making the aggregate material behave as a solid the system may be able to unjam if volume fraction is decreased or external stresses are applied such that they exceed the yield stress this transition is interesting because it is highly nonlinear with respect to volume fraction the jamming phase diagram relates the jamming transition to inverse density stress and temperature the density at which systems jam is determined by many factors including the shape of their components the deformability of the particles frictional interparticle forces and the degree of dispersity of the system the overall shape of the jamming manifold may depend on the particular system for example a particularly interesting feature of the jamming transition is the difference between attractive and repulsive systems whether the jamming surface diverges for high enough densities or low temperatures is uncertain simulations of jammed

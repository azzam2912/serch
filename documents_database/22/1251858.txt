the conjectured intractability of such problems is central to construction of secure lattice based cryptosystems for applications in such cryptosystems lattices over vector spaces often formula 1 or free modules often formula 2 are generally considered for all the problems below assume that we are given in addition to other more specific inputs a basis for the vector space v and a norm n the norm usually considered is l however other norms such as l are also considered and show up in a variety of results let formula 3 denote the length of the shortest non zero vector in the lattice l that is in svp a basis of a vector space v and a norm n often l are given for a lattice l and one must find the shortest non zero vector in v as measured by n in l in other words the algorithm should output a non zero vector v such that formula 5 in the approximation version svp one must find a non zero lattice vector of length at most formula 6 for given formula 7 the exact version of the problem is only known to be np hard for randomized reductions by contrast

the systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl coa l serine o acetyltransferase other names in common use include satase l serine acetyltransferase serine acetyltransferase and serine transacetylase this enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism and sulfur metabolism as of late 2007 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes with pdb accession codes and in molecular biology the protein domain satase is short for serine acetyltransferase and refers to an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of serine to cysteine in e coli more specifically its role is to catalyse the activation of serine by acetyl coa this entry refers to the n terminus of the protein which has a sequence that is conserved in plants and bacteria the n terminal domain of the protein serine acetyltransferase helps catalyse acetyl transfer this particular enzyme catalyses serine into cysteine which is eventually converted to the essential amino acid methionine of particular interest to scientists is the ability to harness the natural ability of the enzyme serine acetyltransferase to create nutritionally essential amino acids and to exploit this ability through transgenic plants these transgenic plants would contain more essential sulphur amino acids meaning a healthier diet for humans and animals

mutations in the aldh4a1 and prodh genes cause hyperprolinemia hyperprolinemia type i is caused by a mutation in the prodh gene which codes for the enzyme proline oxidase this enzyme begins the process of degrading proline by starting the reaction that converts it to pyrroline 5 carboxylate hyperprolinemia type ii is caused by a mutation in the aldh4a1 gene for the enzyme 1 pyrroline 5 carboxylate dehydrogenase this enzyme helps to break down the pyrroline 5 carboxylate produced in the previous reaction converting it to the amino acid glutamate the conversion between proline and glutamine and the reverse reaction controlled by different enzymes are important factors required to maintain proper metabolism and protein production a deficiency of either proline oxidase or pyrroline 5 carboxylate dehydrogenase results in a buildup of proline in the body a deficiency of the latter enzyme leads to higher levels of proline and a buildup of the intermediate breakdown product pyrroline 5 carboxylate causing the signs and symptoms of hyperprolinemia type ii hyperprolinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered most often the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are heterozygous

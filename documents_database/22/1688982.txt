it uses temperature controlled colour changes in the organic cement of agglutinated foraminifera microfossils to estimate thermal alteration the method is empirical and based on determination of colour by visual comparison of fossil specimens to the geological society of america rock color chart munsell colour system under a binocular microscope the fci values 0 to 10 are indicated below agglutinated foraminifera have a long geological history spanning the paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic the fci has many potential applications especially in the analysis of samples from hydrocarbon exploration wells significant colour changes fci 2 to 6 occur through a temperature range of 60 c to 110 c the fci is therefore an indicator of temperatures required to initiate petroleum generation oil window the onset of oil generation correlates approximately to fci 5 6 raman spectroscopy an analytical tool for fingerprinting molecules has confirmed that organic cement is present in fossil agglutinated foraminifera raman spectroscopy and the fci can be used to estimate thermal maturity and therefore assess thermal conditions necessary for hydrocarbon generation the fci methodology is similar to the conodont alteration index cai but the colour temperature relationships differ in that fci is more sensitive to colour change at lower

the nobel prize for chemistry in 1987 was given to donald j cram jean marie lehn and charles j pedersen for their efforts in discovering and determining uses of cryptands and crown ethers thus launching the now flourishing field of supramolecular chemistry the term cryptand implies that this ligand binds substrates in a crypt interring the guest as in a burial these molecules are three dimensional analogues of crown ethers but are more selective and strong as complexes for the guest ions the resulting complexes are lipophilic the most common and most important cryptand is n chchochchochch n the systematic iupac name for this compound is 1 10 diaza 4 7 13 16 21 24 hexaoxabicyclo 8 8 8 hexacosane this compound is termed 2 2 2 cryptand where the numbers indicate the number of ether oxygen atoms and hence binding sites in each of the three bridges between the amine nitrogen caps many cryptands are commercially available under the tradename kryptofix all amine cryptands exhibit particularly high affinity for alkali metal cations which has allowed the isolation of salts of k the three dimensional interior cavity of a cryptand provides a binding site or host for guest ions the

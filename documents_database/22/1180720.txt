it was named after the father of the discoverer agostino boattini agostino is a member of the eunomia family a large group of stony s type asteroids and the most prominent family in the intermediate main belt it orbits the sun at a distance of 2 4 2 9 au once every 4 years and 2 months 1 534 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 10 and an inclination of 15 with respect to the ecliptic the body s observation arc begins 47 years prior to its official discovery observation with a precovery taken at palomar observatory in june 1950 two rotational lightcurves of agostino were obtained in the r band from photometric observations by astronomers at the palomar transient factory in august 2010 and february 2012 respectively lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of and hours with a respective brightness variation of 0 51 and 0 84 in magnitude according to the neowise mission of nasa s space based wide field infrared survey explorer agostino measures 4 9 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0 23 the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link assumes an albedo of 0 21 derived from 15 eunomia the family

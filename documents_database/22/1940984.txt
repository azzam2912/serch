for perspective the observable universe is about 93 billion light years in diameter this massive galactic superstructure in a region of the sky seen in the data set mapping of gamma ray bursts grbs that has been found to have an unusually higher concentration of similarly distanced grbs than the expected average distribution it was discovered in early november 2013 by a team of american and hungarian astronomers led by istv n horv th jon hakkila and zsolt bagoly while analyzing data from the swift gamma ray burst mission together with other data from ground based telescopes it is the largest known formation in the universe exceeding the size of the prior huge lqg by about two times the overdensity lies at the second third and fourth galactic quadrants nq2 nq3 and nq4 of the sky thus it lies in the northern hemisphere centered on the border of the constellations draco and hercules the entire clustering consists of around 19 grbs with the redshift ranges between 1 6 and 2 1 typically the distribution of grbs in the universe appears in the sets of less than the 2 distribution or with less than two grbs in the average data of

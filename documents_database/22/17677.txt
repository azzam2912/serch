the system is unstable the two particles annihilate each other to predominantly produce two or three gamma rays depending on the relative spin states the orbit and energy levels of the two particles are similar to that of the hydrogen atom which is a bound state of a proton and an electron however because of the reduced mass the frequencies of the spectral lines are less than half of the corresponding hydrogen lines the mass of positronium is 1 022 mev which is twice the electron mass minus the binding energy of a few ev the ground state of positronium like that of hydrogen has two possible configurations depending on the relative orientations of the spins of the electron and the positron the singlet state with antiparallel spins s 0 m 0 is known as para positronium p ps it has a mean lifetime of 0 125 ns and decays preferentially into two gamma rays with energy of each in the center of mass frame by detecting these photons the position at which the decay occurred can be determined this process is used in positron emission tomography para positronium can decay into any even number of photons 2 4 6

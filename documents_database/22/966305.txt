operating within a half wavelength of a receiver transmitter tags must use relatively low frequencies less than 30 mhz to achieve significant ranging depending on the choice of frequency nfer has the potential for range resolution of and ranges up to the phase relations between the eh components of an electro magnetic field e and h are the components e electric and h magnetic vary with distance around small antennas this was first discovered by heinrich hertz and is formulated with maxwell s field theory close to a small antenna the electric and magnetic field components of a radio wave are 90 degrees out of phase as the distance from the antenna increases the eh phase difference decreases far from a small antenna in the far field the eh phase difference goes to zero thus a receiver that can separately measure the electric and magnetic field components of a near field signal and compare their phases can measure the range to the transmitter nfer technology is a different approach for locating systems it has several inherent advantages over other rtls systems for instance a radio wave at 1 mhz has a period of 1 s and the eh phase difference

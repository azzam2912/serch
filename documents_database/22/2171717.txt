it is larger than a pilot plant and is the final stage in research development and demonstration of a new process demonstration plants are built in a range of sizes and the term demonstration plant can sometimes be used interchangeably with pilot plant however demonstration plants are generally larger than pilot plants and are often constructed following a successful trial in a pilot scale size demonstration plants are used to prove a process works at industrial scale and is financially viable in its intended industry the goals of a demonstration plant are generally as follows many of the same design techniques that are used for pilot plants are also used when developing demonstration plants 3d modeling chemical similitude studies mass and energy balances risk factors computational fluid dynamics cfd and mathematical modeling are common techniques used to design demonstration modules before actual fabrication occurs the emphasis in a demonstration plant is on using industrial equipment rather than smaller scale equipment to prove process viability a significant amount of product must be produced in equipment that will hold up over a long production lifetime and not be prohibitively expensive a demonstration plant must show that enough end product can be created

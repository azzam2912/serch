the earliest use of a color photo on a cover is the february 1939 issue of true magazine with the february 1940 edition apparently the first to feature a gag worn by a damsel in distress the peak era for these was the era from roughly 1959 until 1986 when due to the meese commission a contribution by park dietz and the end of a few of the publishers of detective or true crime magazines the main era of the bondage cover ended though there were a few issues of detective dragnet in the late 1980s and early 1990s and a brief revival from about 1994 until 2000 though even then they were few and far between unlike the late 1960s when at least two such covers could be seen monthly also the use of over the mouth gags was common enough that the slang term detective gag is used for it

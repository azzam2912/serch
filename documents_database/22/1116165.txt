traditional subjective bayesian analysis is based upon fully specified probability distributions which are very difficult to specify at the necessary level of detail bayes linear analysis attempts to solve this problem by developing theory and practise for using partially specified probability models bayes linear in its current form has been primarily developed by michael goldstein mathematically and philosophically it extends bruno de finetti s operational subjective approach to probability and statistics consider first a traditional bayesian analysis where you expect to shortly know d and you would like to know more about some other observable b in the traditional bayesian approach it is required that every possible outcome is enumerated i e every possible outcome is the cross product of the partition of a set of b and d if represented on a computer where b requires n bits and d m bits then the number of states required is formula 1 the first step to such an analysis is to determine a persons subjective probabilities e g by asking about their betting behaviour for each of these outcomes when we learn d conditional probabilities for b are determined by the application of bayes rule practitioners of subjective bayesian statistics

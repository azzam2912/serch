when the hemisphere is horizontal it is like a spinning top and applies negligible torque to its contact point on the ground when tipped on edge however it pulls like a traditional circular wheel the torque can be quickly vectored in any direction by tilting the hemisphere side to side and or front to back for example if the hemisphere is spinning clockwise tilting it to the right will pull the vehicle forward tilting it to the left will push the vehicle backward and front to back tilt will push left or right notably the torque is proportional to the hemisphere s tilt providing performance similar to an infinite gear ratio but without any gears one limitation of the hog wheel is its reliance on a single point of contact with the ground this requires a flat hard surface especially for small robotic vehicles the october 1938 issue of mechanics and handicraft magazine featured a concept illustration of a hog drive automobile called a hemisphere drive speedster a personal vehicle utilizing a hog drive made from chinese woks won the 1988 toyota olympic ideas competition more recently it has seen use in robotics where it has also been called a

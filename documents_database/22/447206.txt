the name may be considered appropriate when their small sized head 3 mm diameter shaft is compared to a bur fruit seed with hooks or their teeth are compared to a metal burr burrs are a rotary analog to files that cut linearly hence their alternate name rotary files they are also in many ways comparable to endmills and to router bits a distinction is that the latter usually have their toolpath controlled by the machine whereas burrs are often used freehand however there is substantial overlap in the use and toolpath control of these various classes of cutters and in the outcomes accomplished with them for example endmills can be used in routers and burrs can be used like endmills in milling by cnc or manual machine tools in fact burrs the tools are often used in cnc machining centers for removing burrs the small flakes of metal after a machining process to maintain the correct surface speed and cutting conditions burrs are rotated at high speed thousands or tens of thousands of rpm often the top speed available on a given spindle the cutters shown in the image are made from tungsten carbide which allows them to operate

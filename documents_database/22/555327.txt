paos accomplish this removal of phosphate by accumulating it within their cells as polyphosphate paos are by no means the only bacteria that can accumulate polyphosphate within their cells and in fact the production of polyphosphate is a widespread ability among bacteria however the paos have many characteristics that other organisms that accumulate polyphosphate do not have that make them amenable to use in wastewater treatment specifically this is the ability to consume simple carbon compounds energy source without the presence of an external electron acceptor such as nitrate or oxygen by generating energy from internally stored polyphosphate and glycogen most other bacteria cannot consume under these conditions and therefore paos gain a selective advantage within the mixed microbial community present in the activated sludge therefore wastewater treatment plants that operate for enhanced biological phosphorus removal have an anaerobic tank where there is no nitrate or oxygen present as external electron acceptor prior to the other tanks to give paos preferential access to the simple carbon compounds in the wastewater that is influent to the plant a pao related to the betaproteobacteria has been identified and named candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis accumulibacter has been shown to remove phosphorus from ebpr plants

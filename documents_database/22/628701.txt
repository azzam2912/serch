backscattering from monochromator and analyzer crystals is used to achieve an energy resolution in the order of ev neutron backscattering experiments are performed to study atomic or molecular motion on a nanosecond time scale neutron backscattering was proposed by heinz maier leibnitz in 1966 and realized by some of his students in a test setup at the research reactor frm i in garching bei m nchen germany following this successful demonstration of principle permanent spectrometers were built at forschungszentrum j lich and at the institut laue langevin ill later instruments brought an extension of the accessible momentum transfer range in13 at ill the introduction of focussing optics in16 at ill and a further increase of intensity by a compact design with a phase space transform chopper hfbs at nist spheres at frm ii in16b at the institut laue langevin operational backscattering spectrometers at reactors include in10 in13 and in16b at the institut laue langevin the high flux backscattering spectrometer hfbs at the nist center for neutron research the spheres instrument of forschungszentrum j lich at frm ii and emu at ansto inverse geometry spectrometers at spallation sources include iris and osiris at the isis neutron source at rutherford appleton basis

it forms part of a dominantly transform boundary that is part of the southern margin to the north american plate it developed during the eocene when the northern part of the caribbean plate collided with the bahamas platform forcing the southern boundary to propagate southwards this boundary initially formed as two strike slip faults with a large left stepping offset between them generating a pull apart basin continuing movement on the boundary and extension within the pull apart led to the formation of an area of oceanic crust containing a north south trending spreading center that remains active to the present day it is an ultra slow spreading center with an opening rate of 15 17 mm per year when the spreading center formed all the displacement on the swan islands transform fault was transferred by the mid cayman rise to the septentrional oriente fault zone during the late miocene the leading edge of the caribbean plate began to collide with the bahamas platform this led to the development of a new fault system formed of the walton fault zone and the enriquillo plantain garden fault zone carrying some of the plate boundary displacement and creating the gon ve microplate

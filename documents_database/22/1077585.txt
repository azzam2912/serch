the event is well documented and important as a demonstration of transitional forms and exaptation the re purposing of existing structures during evolution in reptiles the eardrum is connected to the inner ear via a single bone the columella while the upper and lower jaws contain several bones not found in mammals over the course of the evolution of mammals one bone from the lower and one from the upper jaw the articular and quadrate bones lost their purpose in the jaw joint and were put to new use in the middle ear connecting to the existing stapes bone and forming a chain of three bones the ossicles which transmit sounds more efficiently and allow more acute hearing in mammals these three bones are known as the malleus incus and stapes hammer anvil and stirrup respectively mammals and birds also differ from other vertebrates by having evolved a cochlea the evidence that the malleus and incus are homologous to the reptilian articular and quadrate was originally embryological and since this discovery an abundance of transitional fossils has both supported the conclusion and given a detailed history of the transition the evolution of the stapes from the hyomandibula was an earlier

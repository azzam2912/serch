when a factory discharges polluted water into a river that pollution can hurt people who fish in or get their drinking water from the river downstream but the factory owner may have no incentive to consider those consequences coordination failure can also prevent market formation again considering the pollution example downstream residents might seek to be paid by the factory owner who pollute their water but because of the free rider problem it may be difficult to coordinate another barrier to pollution markets could be technology if the river has several factories along its banks it may be difficult or impossible to monitor which factory is responsible for downstream pollution high transaction costs might also deter market formation it may be the case that both sides could benefit from an exchange of goods but that setting up such an exchange is prohibitively expensive markets can also be missing if there is a failure of trust or information in non zero sum interactions it is possible that the nash equilibrium for individuals acting independently will be sub optimal in that both parties could benefit from cooperating but on their own will choose not to an example could be a shortage in

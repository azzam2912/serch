as an example note that any simple algebra is a central simple algebra over its center for example the complex numbers c form a csa over themselves but not over the real numbers r the center of c is all of c not just r the quaternions h form a 4 dimensional csa over r and in fact represent the only non trivial element of the brauer group of the reals see below given two central simple algebras a m n s and b m m t over the same field f a and b are called similar or brauer equivalent if their division rings s and t are isomorphic the set of all equivalence classes of central simple algebras over a given field f under this equivalence relation can be equipped with a group operation given by the tensor product of algebras the resulting group is called the brauer group br f of the field f it is always a torsion group we call a field e a splitting field for a over k if a e is isomorphic to a matrix ring over e every finite dimensional csa has a splitting field indeed in the case when a

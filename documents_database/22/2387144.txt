it is named after adriano garsia and michelle l wachs the input to the problem for an integer formula 1 consists of a sequence of formula 2 non negative weights formula 3 the output is a rooted binary tree with formula 1 internal nodes each having exactly two children such a tree has exactly formula 2 leaf nodes which can be identified in the order given by the binary tree with the formula 2 input weights the goal of the problem is to find a tree among all of the possible trees with formula 1 internal nodes that minimizes the weighted sum of the external path lengths these path lengths are the numbers of steps from the root to each leaf they are multiplied by the weight of the leaf and then summed to give the quality of the overall tree this problem can be interpreted as a problem of constructing a binary search tree for formula 1 ordered keys with the assumption that the tree will be used only to search for values that are not already in the tree in this case the formula 1 keys partition the space of search values into formula 2 intervals and the

it is based on the theoretical assumption that every organism whether a single cell or multicellular is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors i e a sensory motor coupling that is to say if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly it is cognitive any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives from one generation to the next and since by darwinian theory the species of every organism is evolving from a common root three further elements of cognitive biology are required i the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful through contrast and comparison to the study of another species cognitive abilities ii it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems and iii the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard the more we understand the nature of cognition while cognitive science endeavors to explain human thought and the conscious mind the work of cognitive biology is focused on the most fundamental process of cognition for any organism in the past

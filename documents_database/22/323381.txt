the first theorem states that a market will tend toward a competitive equilibrium that is weakly pareto optimal when the market maintains the following two attributes 1 complete markets with no transaction costs and therefore each actor also having perfect information 2 price taking behavior with no monopolists and easy entry and exit from a market furthermore the first theorem states that the equilibrium will be fully pareto optimal with the additional condition of 3 local nonsatiation of preferences such that for any original bundle of goods there is another bundle of goods arbitrarily close to the original bundle but which is preferred the second theorem states that out of all possible pareto optimal outcomes one can achieve any particular one by enacting a lump sum wealth redistribution and then letting the market take over the first theorem is often taken to be an analytical confirmation of adam smith s invisible hand hypothesis namely that competitive markets tend toward an efficient allocation of resources the theorem supports a case for non intervention in ideal conditions let the markets do the work and the outcome will be pareto efficient however pareto efficiency is not necessarily the same thing as desirability it

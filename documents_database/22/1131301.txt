this protein is one of two paralogs of the ral protein the other being rala and part of the ras gtpase family rala functions as a molecular switch to activate a number of biological processes majorly cell division and transport via signaling pathways its biological role thus implicates it in many cancers the ral isoforms share an 80 overall match in amino acid sequence and 100 match in their effector binding region the two isoforms mainly differ in the c terminal hypervariable region which contains multiple sites for post translational modification leading to diverging subcellular localization and biological function for example phosphorylation of serine 194 on rala by the kinase aurora a results in the relocation of rala to the inner mitochondrial membrane where rala helps carry out mitochondrial fission whereas phosphorylation of serine 198 on ralb by the kinase pkc results in the relocation of ralb to other internal membranes and activation of its tumorigenic function ralb is one of two proteins in the ral family which is itself a subfamily within the ras family of small gtpases as a ras gtpase ralb functions as a molecular switch that becomes active when bound to gtp and inactive when bound

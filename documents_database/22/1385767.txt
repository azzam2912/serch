these highly efficient engines were first flown on the us atlas centaur and were one of the main factors of nasa s success in reaching the moon by the saturn v rocket rocket engines burning cryogenic propellants remain in use today on high performance upper stages and boosters upper stages are numerous boosters include esa s ariane 5 jaxa s h ii and the united states delta iv and space launch system rocket engines need high mass flow rates of both oxidizer and fuel to generate useful thrust oxygen the simplest and most common oxidizer is in the gas phase at standard temperature and pressure as is the simplest fuel hydrogen while it is possible to store propellants as pressurized gases this would require large heavy tanks that would make achieving orbital spaceflight difficult if not impossible on the other hand if the propellants are cooled sufficiently they exist in the liquid phase at higher density and lower pressure simplifying tankage these cryogenic temperatures vary depending on the propellant with liquid oxygen existing below 183 c 90 k and liquid hydrogen below 253 c 20 k since one or more of the propellants is in the liquid phase all cryogenic

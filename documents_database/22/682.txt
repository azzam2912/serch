the addition and multiplication operations together give a the structure of a ring the addition and scalar multiplication operations together give a the structure of a vector space over k in this article we will also use the term k algebra to mean an associative algebra over the field k a standard first example of a k algebra is a ring of square matrices over a field k with the usual matrix multiplication in this article associative algebras are assumed to have a multiplicative unit denoted 1 they are sometimes called unital associative algebras for clarification in some areas of mathematics this assumption is not made and we will call such structures non unital associative algebras we will also assume that all rings are unital and all ring homomorphisms are unital many authors consider the more general concept of an associative algebra over a commutative ring r instead of a field an r algebra is an r module with an associative r bilinear binary operation which also contains a multiplicative identity for examples of this concept if s is any ring with center c then s is an associative c algebra let r be a fixed commutative ring so r

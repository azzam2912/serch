these sequence structure motifs are used for the local structure prediction of proteins local structure can be expressed as fragments or as backbone angles locations in the protein sequence that have high confidence i sites predictions may be the initiation sites of folding i sites have also been identified as discrete models for folding pathways i sites consist of about 250 motifs each motif has an amino acid profile a fragment structure represented by a paradigm fragment chosen from a protein in the pdb and optionally a 4 dimensional tensor of pairwise sequence covariance the sequence and structure database the database initially consisted of 471 protein sequence families from the hssp database with an average of 47 aligned sequences per family each family contained a single known structure parent from the brookhaven protein data bank these were a subset of the pdbselect 25 list having no more than 25 sequence identity between any two alignments disordered loops were omitted gaps and insertions in the sequence were ignored clustering of sequence segments each position in the database is described by a weighted amino acid frequency a similarity measure in sequence space between a segment p and a cluster of segments q

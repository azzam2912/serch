rankl has been identified to affect the immune system and control bone regeneration and remodeling rankl is an apoptosis regulator gene a binding partner of osteoprotegerin opg a ligand for the receptor rank and controls cell proliferation by modifying protein levels of id4 id2 and cyclin d1 rankl is expressed in several tissues and organs including skeletal muscle thymus liver colon small intestine adrenal gland osteoblast mammary gland epithelial cells prostate and pancreas variation in concentration levels of rankl throughout several organs reconfirms the importance of rankl in tissue growth particularly bone growth and immune functions within the body the level of rankl expression does not linearly correlate to the effect of this ligand high protein expression of rankl is commonly detected in the lungs thymus and lymph nodes low protein expression is found in bone marrow the stomach peripheral blood the spleen the placenta leukocytes the heart the thyroid and skeletal muscle while bone marrow expresses low levels of rankl rankl plays a critical role for adequate bone metabolism this surface bound molecule also known as cd254 found on osteoblasts serves to activate osteoclasts which are critically involved in bone resorption osteoclastic activity is triggered via the osteoblasts surface

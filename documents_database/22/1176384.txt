just like all domain decomposition methods so that the number of iterations does not grow with the number of subdomains neumann neumann methods require the solution of a coarse problem to provide global communication the balancing domain decomposition is a neumann neumann method with a special kind of coarse problem more specifically consider a domain on which we wish to solve the poisson equation for some function f split the domain into two non overlapping subdomains and with common boundary and let u and u be the values of u in each subdomain at the interface between the two subdomains the two solutions must satisfy the matching conditions where n is the unit normal vector to an iterative method for approximating each u satisfying the matching conditions is to first solve the decoupled problems i 1 2 for some function on we then solve the two neumann problems we then obtain the next iterate by setting for some parameters and this procedure can be viewed as a richardson iteration for the iterative solution of the equations arising from the schur complement method this continuous iteration can be discretized by the finite element method and then solved in parallel on a

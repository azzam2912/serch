treatment is primarily aimed at individuals with an adipose triglyceride lipase atgl enzyme deficiency or mutation because of the essential ppar protein interactions with free fatty acid monomers derived from the atgl catalyzed lipid oxidation reaction it was discovered as wy 14 643 in 1974 adipose triglyceride lipase atgl an enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting hydrolysis step of triglycerides in the triacylglycerol lipolysis cascade is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue but is also found in lesser amounts within cardiac and skeletal muscle its function is to initiate the breakdown of intracellular triglycerides into fatty acid monomers individuals deficient in the atgl enzyme are at higher risk for cardiac dysfunction and premature death because of increased size and accumulation of lipid droplets within cardiac myocytes ppars are a family of ligand activated receptors which include ppar ppar and ppar subtypes that are expressed in varying amounts in nuclear membranes of in different tissues ppar activation occurs with free fatty acid binding or fatty acid derivative ligands that have been broken down via the triacylglycerol lipolysis cascade activated ppars act as transcription factors to increase expression of specific genes within cells ppar a ppar subtype controls the expression of genes involved

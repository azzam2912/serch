even if a metric is not a measurement metrics are functions while measurements are the numbers obtained by the application of metrics often the two terms are used as synonyms since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences there is a continuous effort by computer science practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development the goal is obtaining objective reproducible and quantifiable measurements which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning cost estimation quality assurance testing software debugging software performance optimization and optimal personnel task assignments common software measurements include as software development is a complex process with high variance on both methodologies and objectives it is difficult to define or measure software qualities and quantities and to determine a valid and concurrent measurement metric especially when making such a prediction prior to the detail design another source of difficulty and debate is in determining which metrics matter and what they mean the practical utility of software measurements has therefore been limited to the following domains a specific measurement may target one or more of the above aspects or the balance between them for example as an indicator of team motivation or project performance some

it is one component of the runoff of water from the land to waterbodies the other component being surface runoff water flowing in channels comes from surface runoff from adjacent hillslopes from groundwater flow out of the ground and from water discharged from pipes the discharge of water flowing in a channel is measured using stream gauges or can be estimated by the manning equation the record of flow over time is called a hydrograph flooding occurs when the volume of water exceeds the capacity of the channel streams and rivers play a critical role in the hydrologic cycle that is essential for all life on earth a diversity of biological species from unicellular organisms to vertebrates depend on flowing water systems for their habitat and food resources rivers are major aquatic landscapes for all manners of plants and animals rivers even help keep the aquifers underground full of water by discharging water downward through their streambeds in addition to that the oceans stay full of water because rivers and runoff continually refreshes them streamflow is the main mechanism by which water moves from the land to the oceans or to basins of interior drainage surface and subsurface sources stream

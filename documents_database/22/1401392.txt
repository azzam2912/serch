it was designed in the mid 1970s to assist in the understanding of the then new microprocessors users of the mpt8080 enter assembly language programs via binary switches or a hexadecimal keypad while the code executes the user can observe what is happening on the address data and control signals of the microprocessor the mpt8080 acts like a simulator in that code can be stepped through one instruction or each cycle of each individual instruction at a time to observe what is happening the mpt8080 has simple input and output consisting of eight leds and eight switches the input port allows code to sense the state of external switches whilst the output port can display information on one of its eight leds the input and outputs port also have connectors allowing them to be connected to external signals through accessory patch kits allowing the mpt8080 to control and monitor other circuitry initially a motorola 6800 based trainer was developed alongside the intel 8080 based model but due to technical and operational issues the 6800 trainer was abandoned as recently as 2012 the mpt8080 remained in academic use at king s college london as part of a course in practical physics

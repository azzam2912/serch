the original jewish law made at some time after the first jewish roman war with vespasian and his son titus saw additional amendments by later rabbinic courts all of which were meant to safe guard against depriving the original landowners and their heirs of any land that belonged to them and to ensure their ability to redeem such property in the future the origin of the word sicaricon or saqr q n is now obscure the word is believed by some to be a corruption of the greek word or what is called in latin caesaricium others namely heinrich graetz and m s zuckermandel think the word to be derived from sicarii a group associated with murders brigandage and robbery during the second temple period rabbi and scholar hai gaon also thought that the word sicarii is to be ascribed to government personnel involved with implementing the laws of sicaricon largely mentioned in regard to assassinations there is no historical evidence however to connect the sicarii with the expropriation of land the author of sefer arukh brings down a different interpretation saying that the word is merely an acronym for take my land but leave me alone a view supported

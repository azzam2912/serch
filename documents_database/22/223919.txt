common measurements of traffic are total volume in units of multiples of the byte or as transmission rates in bytes per certain time units as the topology of the internet is not hierarchical no single point of measurement is possible for total internet traffic traffic data may be obtained from peering points of the tier 1 network providers for indications of volume and growth such data however excludes traffic that remains within a single service provider s network as well as traffic that crosses private peering points file sharing constitutes a large fraction of internet traffic the prevalent technology for file sharing is the bittorrent protocol which is a peer to peer p2p system mediated through indexing sites that provide resource directories the traffic patterns of p2p systems are often described as problematic and causing congestion according to a sandvine research in 2013 bit torrent s share of internet traffic decreased by 20 to 7 4 overall reduced from 31 in 2008 the internet does not employ any formally centralized facilities for traffic management its progenitor networks especially the arpanet established early backbone infrastructure which carried traffic between major interchange centers for traffic resulting in a tiered hierarchical system of

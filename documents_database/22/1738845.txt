the protein also known as c14orf42 is an enzyme with thioesterase activity the protein encoded by the acot1 gene is part of a family of acyl coa thioesterases which catalyze the hydrolysis of various coenzyme a esters of various molecules to the free acid plus coa these enzymes have also been referred to in the literature as acyl coa hydrolases acyl coa thioester hydrolases and palmitoyl coa hydrolases the reaction carried out by these enzymes is as follows coa ester ho free acid coenzyme a these enzymes use the same substrates as long chain acyl coa synthetases but have a unique purpose in that they generate the free acid and coa as opposed to long chain acyl coa synthetases which ligate fatty acids to coa to produce the coa ester the role of the acot family of enzymes is not well understood however it has been suggested that they play a crucial role in regulating the intracellular levels of coa esters coenzyme a and free fatty acids recent studies have shown that acyl coa esters have many more functions than simply an energy source these functions include allosteric regulation of enzymes such as acetyl coa carboxylase hexokinase iv and the

one essential utility of a peptide spectral library is to serve as consensus templates supporting the identification of peptide proteins based on the correlation between the templates with experimental spectra one potential application of peptide spectral libraries is the identification of new currently unknown mass spectra here the spectra from the library are compared to the new spectra and if a match is found the unknown spectra can be assigned the identity of the known peptide in the library spectral libraries have been used in the small molecules mass spectra identification since the 1980s in the early years of shotgun proteomics pioneer investigations suggested that a similar approach might be applicable in shotgun proteomics for peptide protein identification modern tandem ms instruments combine features of fast duty cycle exquisite sensitivity and unprecedented mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry which is an ideal match for the large scale protein identification and quantification in complex biological systems in a shotgun proteomics approach proteins in a complex mixture are digested by proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin subsequently one or more chromatographic separations are applied to resolve resulting peptides which are then ionized and analyzed in a mass spectrometer to acquire tandem mass spectra a

they were proposed in 2001 by brothers charles and martin vacanti and colleagues further work in collaboration with japanese researchers led to the apparent discovery of stap cells in which the pluripotent cells were newly created by stress or injury this work was published in 2014 but soon found to be due to fraudulent work by haruko obokata spore like cells were said to be a specific class of stem cells in adult organisms including humans which are small versatile and most frequently remain in a dormant spore like state as the rest of the cells of the organism divide grow and die despite their dormancy they apparently retain the ability to grow divide and differentiate into other cell types expressing characteristics appropriate to the tissue environment from which they were initially isolated if some external stimulus should prompt them to do so this capacity to continue to regenerate new cells has been shown in in vitro conditions for some animals in which all other cells have died especially if the animal died from exposure to cold elements spore like cells were said to remain viable in unprepared tissue using no special preservation techniques frozen at 86 c and then

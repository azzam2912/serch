this was confirmed as a myth by several british police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls the basis for the myth was a feature of blackberry phones if the battery level was too low the phone automatically locked down phone features and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services people discovered that if they dialed 999 then immediately hung up it would override the shutdown for a number of minutes so that phone calls could be made the myth is believed to have originated in blackberry forums around 2012 in 2013 derbyshire constabulary released a press release telling people not to believe the myth that calling 999 charges the battery they cited that for every silent or aborted 999 call received the operators have to call the person back to make sure there is no emergency these hoax calls waste police time that could potentially block responses to real emergencies bedfordshire police also released information asking people not to call 999 except for an emergency as they stated that in the last six months of 2013 they had an increase in hoax 999 calls from people believing the myth other sources

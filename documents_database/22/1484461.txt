the process although similar in many ways to direct writing using electrons nevertheless offers some interesting and unique advantages protons which are approximately 1800 times more massive than electrons have deeper penetration in materials and travel in an almost straight path this feature allows the fabrication of three dimensional high aspect ratio structures with vertical smooth sidewalls and low line edge roughness calculations have also indicated that p beam writing exhibits minimal proximity effects unwanted exposure due to secondary electrons since the secondary electrons induced in proton electron collisions have low energy a further advantage stems from the ability of protons to displace atoms while traversing material thereby increasing localized damage especially at the end of range p beam writing produces resistive patterns at depth in silicon allowing patterning of selective regions with different optical properties as well as the removal of undamaged regions via electrochemical etching the primary mechanisms for producing structures in resist materials is in general bond scissioning in positive resists such as pmma polymethylmethacrylate or cross linking in negative resists such as su 8 in positive resists the regions damaged by protons are removed by chemical development to produce structures whereas in negative resists the development

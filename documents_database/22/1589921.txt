the concept of proteostasis maintenance is central to understanding the cause of diseases associated with excessive protein misfolding and degradation leading to loss of function phenotypes as well as aggregation associated degenerative disorders therefore adapting proteostasis should enable the restoration of proteostasis once its loss leads to pathology cellular proteostasis is key to ensuring successful development healthy aging resistance to environmental stresses and to minimize homeostasis perturbations by pathogens such as viruses mechanisms by which proteostasis is ensured include regulated protein translation chaperone assisted protein folding and protein degradation pathways adjusting each of these mechanisms to the demand for proteins is essential to maintain all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded proteome one of the first points of regulation for proteostasis is during translation this is accomplished via the structure of the ribosome a complex central to translation these two characteristics shape the way the protein folds and influences the proteins future interactions the synthesis of a new peptide chain using the ribosome is very slow and the ribosome can even be stalled when it encounters a rare codon a codon found at low concentrations in the cell these pauses provide an opportunity for an individual protein domain to

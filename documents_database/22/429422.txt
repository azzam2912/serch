it is very similar to the daiquiri which is usually identified with cuba and the caipirinha identified with brazil the drink is traditionally made with white rhum agricole lime and cane syrup while aged rhum agricole can be used in place of white rhum agricole other fruit flavors may be added on top of the lime and sugar may be substituted for cane syrup a ti punch can only be made with rhum agricole it is usually served as an ap ritif before starting a meal both as a matter of tradition and because the drink itself is strongly alcoholic a popular tradition is that of roughly each prepares his own death where instead of serving the mixed drink the bartender or host will simply place out the ingredients and everyone will prepare the drink according to his or her own taste opinions differ as to whether it should be served with or without ice but most agree that the real ti punch should be served without ice however adding a small amount of ice allows the flavours of the ingredients to blossom

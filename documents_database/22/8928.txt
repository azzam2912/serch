neodymium belongs to the lanthanide series and is a rare earth element it is a hard slightly malleable silvery metal that quickly tarnishes in air and moisture when oxidized neodymium reacts quickly to produce pink purple blue and yellow compounds in the 2 3 and 4 oxidation states neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the austrian chemist carl auer von welsbach it is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals monazite and bastn site neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides and it is usually refined for general use although neodymium is classed as a rare earth element it is fairly common no rarer than cobalt nickel or copper and is widely distributed in the earth s crust most of the world s commercial neodymium is mined in china neodymium compounds were first commercially used as glass dyes in 1927 and they remain a popular additive in glasses the color of neodymium compounds is due to the nd ion and is often a reddish purple but it changes with the type of lighting due to the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands of neodymium with ambient light enriched with the sharp visible

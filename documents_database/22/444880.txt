the gauss markov theorem shows that when this is so formula 1 is a best linear unbiased estimator blue if however the measurements are uncorrelated but have different uncertainties a modified approach might be adopted aitken showed that when a weighted sum of squared residuals is minimized formula 1 is the blue if each weight is equal to the reciprocal of the variance of the measurement if the errors are correlated the resulting estimator is the blue if the weight matrix is equal to the inverse of the variance covariance matrix of the observations when the errors are uncorrelated it is convenient to simplify the calculations to factor the weight matrix as formula 4 the normal equations can then be written in the same form as ordinary least squares where we define the following scaled matrix and vector this is a type of whitening transformation the last expression involves an entrywise division for non linear least squares systems a similar argument shows that the normal equations should be modified as follows note that for empirical tests the appropriate w is not known for sure and must be estimated for this feasible generalized least squares fgls techniques may be used in

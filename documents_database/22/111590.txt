this process is one of the simplest unit operations if the throttling valve or device is located at the entry into a pressure vessel so that the flash evaporation occurs within the vessel then the vessel is often referred to as a flash drum if the saturated liquid is a single component liquid for example propane or liquid ammonia a part of the liquid immediately flashes into vapor both the vapor and the residual liquid are cooled to the saturation temperature of the liquid at the reduced pressure this is often referred to as auto refrigeration and is the basis of most conventional vapor compression refrigeration systems if the saturated liquid is a multi component liquid for example a mixture of propane isobutane and normal butane the flashed vapor is richer in the more volatile components than is the remaining liquid uncontrolled flash evaporation can result in a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion bleve the flash evaporation of a single component liquid is an isenthalpic process and is often referred to as an adiabatic flash the following equation derived from a simple heat balance around the throttling valve or device is used to predict how much of a single component

petersburg russia after finishing saint petersburg lyceum 30 pavel belov graduated with honors from the itmo university in 2000 he defended his phd thesis twice from itmo university in russia in 2003 with the thesis analytical modeling of electromagnetic crystals and then in finland in 2006 at the helsinki university of technology with the thesis analytical modeling of metamaterials and new principle of sub wavelength imaging in november 2010 he received doctor of science degree for his thesis analytical modeling of electromagnetic crystals and left handed materials the main dr belov s achievement is the development of metamaterials which can transfer superresolution images ie much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation used which is much better than the resolution of conventional optical systems for image transmission and processing findings of pavel belov have both fundamental and practical importance because they can radically change the concept of designing optical and microwave components of various devices and thus lead to a revolution in information and telecommunication technologies in 2010 pavel belov invited professor yuri kivshar as a leading researcher in terms of government megagrant program together they established international research centre for nanophotonics and metamaterials this laboratory performs broad research in

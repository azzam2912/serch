working directly with decimal base 10 fractions can avoid the rounding errors that otherwise typically occur when converting between decimal fractions common in human entered data such as measurements or financial information and binary base 2 fractions the advantage of decimal floating point representation over decimal fixed point and integer representation is that it supports a much wider range of values for example while a fixed point representation that allocates 8 decimal digits and 2 decimal places can represent the numbers 123456 78 8765 43 123 00 and so on a floating point representation with 8 decimal digits could also represent 1 2345678 1234567 8 0 000012345678 12345678000000000 and so on this wider range can dramatically slow the accumulation of rounding errors during successive calculations for example the kahan summation algorithm can be used in floating point to add many numbers with no asymptotic accumulation of rounding error early mechanical uses of decimal floating point are evident in the abacus slide rule the smallwood calculator and some other calculators that support entries in scientific notation in the case of the mechanical calculators the exponent is often treated as side information that is accounted for separately the ibm 650 computer supported

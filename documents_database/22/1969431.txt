it decomposes above 300 c in the family of dialkyl phosphinic acid salts aluminium diethyl phosphinate has been found to be an excellent flame retardant for use in engineering plastics such as polyamides polyesters thermosets and elastomers it was developed by hoechst later by clariant chemicals and ticona in 2004 and 2012 clariant chemicals opened its first and second commercial production lines respectively in huerth knapsack near cologne aluminium diethyl phosphinate acts as a flame retardant in the condensed phase in contributing to charring of the polymer matrix and thus protecting the substrate against heat and oxygen attack in parallel it acts in the gas phase by radical reactions removing from the combustion zone the high energy radicals h and oh which determine flame propagation and heat release the phosphinate partly vaporises and partly decomposes to volatile diethyl phosphinic acid and an aluminium phosphate residue which acts as a barrier for fuel and heat transport aluminium diethyl phosphinate is used as a halogen free flame retardant for polyamides polyesters thermoset resins e g epoxies in electrical engineering and electronics e e applications for switches plugs pc fans and structural and housing components smartphones washing machines and airplane parts among others

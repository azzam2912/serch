this is done by electronically converting the luminaires to high frequency operation t5 lamps are approximately 40 smaller than t8 lamps t5 lamps have a miniature bi pin base while t8 lamps use a medium bi pin base conversion kits are available which will work in existing fittings containing switch start mains frequency fluorescent lamp ballasts the kits convert the fittings to use energy efficient high frequency ballasts and accommodate the smaller diameter t5 lamp the magnetic ballast remains in place but it is bypassed rendering it ineffective as a conductor the new high frequency ballast draws only 2 w rather than the 6 10 w of the old ballast increasing the efficiency of the system changing to this type of lamp without taking the ballast out of operation rather than simply bypassing it results in an increased power factor for the fitting this increase in power is a result of the separate coils used in an electric ballast as opposed to the single coil in a magnetic ballast because it allows the electricity to flow more consistently there are tree main types of conversion kits t5 retrofit conversion can maintain existing lighting levels at up to 65 reduction in

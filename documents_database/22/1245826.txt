the tooling and processes are the same between the two only the terminology is different in blanking the punched out piece is used and called a blank in piercing the punched out piece is scrap the process for parts manufactured simultaneously with both techniques is often termed pierce and blank an alternative name of piercing is punching burrs and die rolls are typical defects of trimmed surfaces the surface finish will be lower in the so called fracture zone i e where the material is irregularly stripped away from the matching surface at the end of the shearing operation die roll is a plastic deformation of the sheet edge which causes permanent edge rounding burr height is typically used as an index to measure tool wear because it is easy to measure during production the selection criteria of all process parameters are governed by the sheet thickness and by the strength of the work piece material being pierced the punch die clearance is a crucial parameter which determines the load or pressure experienced at the cutting edge of the tool commonly known as point pressure excessive point pressure can lead to accelerated wear and ultimately failure the surface quality of

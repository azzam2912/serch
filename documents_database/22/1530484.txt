it exists as pale yellow crystals which are soluble in organic solvents but decompose when in solution it has been examined as a catalyst and reagent mesitylene molybdenum tricarbonyl arises from the reaction of molybdenum hexacarbonyl with hot mesitylene it can also be synthesized with good yields by displacement of pyridine ligands of the trispyridine complex mo co pyridine in the presence of lewis acids this reaction proceeds at lower temperatures of the compound than the direct method the mesitylene group is bonded to the molybdenum centre through delocalized electron ring the aromaticity of the ligand is indicated by its ability to undergo friedel crafts reactions e g with acetyl chloride such reactions are slower on the tricarbonyl mesitylene molybdenum than benzene which suggests that the electron density contributes to the bonding to the molybdenum the tricarbonyl mesitylene molybdenum complex adopts a near c symmetry with the three carbonyl groups occupying an eclipsed arrangement relative to the three methyl groups the mesityl group is to the molybdenum central metal atom which lies 0 009 away from the ring centre and the methyl groups on the benzene are bent out of plane by 0 035 due to steric interaction with the

this family is characterized by its petioles and specific wood pattern and it grew only in the paleozoic era specifically in north america and europe it is divided into three genera based on stem structure calamopitys stenomyelon and diichinia it was named by solms laubach in 1896 since then its genera have been added to and grouped differently though these three genera are currently depicted as the only genera of this family calamopityaceae is the largest family in pteriodspermatophyta this family is composed of gymnosperms and because of their stem structure discovered through fossil rocks they are considered to be in this division however nothing is known of their reproductive organs but they are classified as seed plants based on their similarities to the lyginopteridaceae and medullasaceae families within pteriodspermatophyta calamopityaceae resemble lyginopteridaceae and medullasaceae in the monoxylic wood structures in their stem this structure suggests the stem diameter less than 1 5 cm was narrow during the calamopityaceae plant lifetime only some petiole tissue has been found it is classified to be of the kalymma genus and suggests the plant had large fronds to identify a genus within this family this petiole structure and monoxylic wood must be present

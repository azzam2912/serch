it is a hybrid discipline involving aspects of transport engineering and traditional urban planning indeed many transit planners find themselves involved in discourse with urban land use issues such as transit oriented development transit planners are responsible for developing routes and networks of routes for urban transit systems these may follow one or more models depending on the character of the communities they serve for example in urban areas a system may attract enough ridership to support high frequencies of service at these high frequencies services can operate at demand service levels where the specific frequency of service in each corridor can be independent and where transfers can reasonably occur at random in less densely developed areas service may operate somewhat infrequently to optimize the quality of trips for customers some systems compensate by operating a timed transfer system in this model routes are designed to bring buses or trains or ferries together at a central location at predetermined times customers then transfer between the vehicles which leave a few minutes later in systems committed to this system routes are designed to take travel time into account in addition to serving customers transportation needs transit planners often consider transportation projects

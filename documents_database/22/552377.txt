this approach is diametrically opposite to that of capability based security computer operating systems provide different levels of access to resources a protection ring is one of two or more hierarchical levels or layers of privilege within the architecture of a computer system this is generally hardware enforced by some cpu architectures that provide different cpu modes at the hardware or microcode level rings are arranged in a hierarchy from most privileged most trusted usually numbered zero to least privileged least trusted usually with the highest ring number on most operating systems ring 0 is the level with the most privileges and interacts most directly with the physical hardware such as the cpu and memory special gates between rings are provided to allow an outer ring to access an inner ring s resources in a predefined manner as opposed to allowing arbitrary usage correctly gating access between rings can improve security by preventing programs from one ring or privilege level from misusing resources intended for programs in another for example spyware running as a user program in ring 3 should be prevented from turning on a web camera without informing the user since hardware access should be a ring 1

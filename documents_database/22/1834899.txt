the term compact here does not refer to any topology on the semigroup let s be a semigroup and x a finite set of letters a system of equations is a subset e of the cartesian product x x of the free monoid finite strings over x with itself the system e is satisfiable in s if there is a map f from x to s which extends to a semigroup morphism f from x to s such that for all u v in e we have f u f v in s such an f is a solution or satisfying assignment for the system e two systems of equations are equivalent if they have the same set of satisfying assignments a system of equations if independent if it is not equivalent to a proper subset of itself a semigroup is compact if every independent system of equations is finite the class of compact semigroups does not form an equational variety however a variety of monoids has the property that all its memberss are compact if and only if all finitely generated members satisfy the maximal condition on congruences any family of congruences ordered by inclusion has a maximal element

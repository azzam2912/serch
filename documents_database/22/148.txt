it was first isolated by french chemist andr louis debierne in 1899 friedrich oskar giesel later independently isolated it in 1902 and unaware that it was already known gave it the name emanium actinium gave the name to the actinide series a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table it is also sometimes considered the first of the 7th period transition metals although lawrencium is less commonly given that position together with polonium radium and radon actinium was one of the first non primordial radioactive elements to be isolated a soft silvery white radioactive metal actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation as with most lanthanides and many actinides actinium assumes oxidation state 3 in nearly all its chemical compounds actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope ac which decays with a half life of 21 772 years predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles and ac which is beta active with a half life of 6 15 hours one tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0 2 milligrams of actinium 227

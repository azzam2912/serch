two toxins from this source have been identified one acting on sodium channels and one acting on calcium channels the toxin acting on na channels has a molecular weight of 12 kda and consists of 105 amino acids the gpt that acts on ca channels has a molecular weight of 19 kda its structure is as of yet unknown the 12 kda gpt inhibits the inactivation of na channels this results in a maintained open state of the channel and allows for more na influx as a result the action potential duration is prolonged the maintained open state of sodium channels induces a longer lasting action potential which allows for persistent activation of calcium channels and more calcium influx the prolongation of the action potential and its subsequent positive inotropic effect can be influenced by stimulus frequency at higher frequencies 1 hz the effects of gpt were suppressed furthermore the effects of gpt on the sodium channels depend on the membrane potential of the cell preceding gpt binding suggesting that the effects of gpt are potential dependent also in the presence of gpt sodium channels are activated in response to an unusually small depolarizing stimulus the 19 kda gpt stimulates

haplogroups are used to represent the major branch points on the mitochondrial phylogenetic tree understanding the evolutionary path of the female lineage has helped population geneticists trace the matrilineal inheritance of modern humans back to human origins in africa and the subsequent spread around the globe the letter names of the haplogroups not just mitochondrial dna haplogroups run from a to z as haplogroups were named in the order of their discovery the alphabetical ordering does not have any meaning in terms of actual genetic relationships the hypothetical woman at the root of all these groups meaning just the mitochondrial dna haplogroups is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor mrca for all currently living humans she is commonly called mitochondrial eve the rate at which mitochondrial dna mutates is known as the mitochondrial molecular clock it s an area of ongoing research with one study reporting one mutation per 8000 years this phylogenetic tree is based van oven 2009 a 2012 paper suggested that the haplogroups most common in modern european populations were h j k n1 t u4 u5 v x and w african haplogroups l0 l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 t u5a australian haplogroups m42a m42c m14

these include the chemistry at earth s surface the rate of cooling of the planet s interior the gravitational interactions with other objects in the solar system and a steady increase in the sun s luminosity an uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans such as climate engineering which could cause significant changes to the planet the current holocene extinction is being caused by technology and the effects may last for up to five million years in turn technology may result in the extinction of humanity leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long term natural processes over time intervals of hundreds of millions of years random celestial events pose a global risk to the biosphere which can result in mass extinctions these include impacts by comets or asteroids and the possibility of a massive stellar explosion called a supernova within a 100 light year radius of the sun other large scale geological events are more predictable milankovitch theory predicts that the planet will continue to undergo glacial periods at least until the quaternary glaciation comes to an end these periods are caused by variations in

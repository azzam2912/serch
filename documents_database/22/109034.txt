it is also a secondary site of androgen synthesis the adrenal cortex comprises three main zones or layers that are regulated by distinct hormones as noted below this anatomic zonation can be appreciated at the microscopic level where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics the precursor of steroids synthesized in the adrenal cortex is cholesterol that is stored in vesicles cholesterol can be synthesized de novo in the adrenal cortex yet the major source of cholesterol appears to be cholesterol that is taken up with circulating lipoproteins the steps up to this point occur in many steroid producing tissues subsequent steps to generate aldosterone and cortisol however primarily occur in the adrenal cortex the adrenal cortex produces a number of different corticosteroid hormones the primary mineralocorticoid aldosterone is produced in the adrenocortical zona glomerulosa by the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase also known as cyp11b2 aldosterone is largely responsible for the long term regulation of blood pressure aldosterone effects on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium by principal cells and hydrogen ions

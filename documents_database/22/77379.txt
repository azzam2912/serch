it is common to several classes of organic compounds as part of many larger functional groups a compound containing a carbonyl group is often referred to as a carbonyl compound the term carbonyl can also refer to carbon monoxide as a ligand in an inorganic or organometallic complex a metal carbonyl e g nickel carbonyl the remainder of this article concerns itself with the organic chemistry definition of carbonyl where carbon and oxygen share a double bond a carbonyl group characterizes the following types of compounds note that the most specific labels are usually employed for example r co o co r structures are known as acid anhydride rather than the more generic ester even though the ester motif is present other organic carbonyls are urea and the carbamates the derivatives of acyl chlorides chloroformates and phosgene carbonate esters thioesters lactones lactams hydroxamates and isocyanates examples of inorganic carbonyl compounds are carbon dioxide and carbonyl sulfide a special group of carbonyl compounds are 1 3 dicarbonyl compounds that have acidic protons in the central methylene unit examples are meldrum s acid diethyl malonate and acetylacetone because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon carbonyl compounds often have resonance structures which affect

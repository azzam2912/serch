despite different backgrounds sanders had trained in architecture and advertising sutherland in electrical engineering they shared a passion for music and electrostatic loudspeakers discussion of electrostatic speakers and the available technology led sanders and sutherland to design and build an electrostatic speaker sanders organized a research and development team to transform a design he had tinkered with for more than a decade into a marketable electrostatic transducer the first prototype was ready in 1980 the sound quality was adequate but at high volume levels there was arcing within the electrostatic panels the team began experiments with aerospace materials that led to improved performance the drivers were made with conductive coatings insulation and adhesives and an ultra light mylar diaphragm between two perforated steel stators satisfied with the aesthetics sanders still struggled with achieving satisfactory high frequency dispersion without compromising sound quality physically wide transducers radiate high frequencies in a narrow beam rather than fanning them over a wide area the solution came in a midnight session when sutherland sketched a theoretical sound wave to illustrate how sound disperses sanders envisioned a horizontally curved panel the curvilinear line source or cls transducer central to the design of every martinlogan electrostat since

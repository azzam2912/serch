a less common antithyroid agent is potassium perchlorate in graves disease treatment with antithyroid medications must be given for six months to two years in order to be effective even then upon cessation of the drugs the hyperthyroid state may recur side effects of the antithyroid medications include a potentially fatal reduction in the level of white blood cells a randomized control trial testing single dose treatment for graves found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil 77 1 on methimazole 15 mg vs 19 4 in the propylthiouracil 150 mg groups but generally both drugs are considered equivalent a study has shown no difference in outcome for adding thyroxine to antithyroid medication and continuing thyroxine versus placebo after antithyroid medication withdrawal however two markers were found that can help predict the risk of recurrence these two markers are an elevated level of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies tshr ab and smoking a positive tshr ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment increases the risk of recurrence to 90 sensitivity 39 specificity 98 a negative tshr ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment is associated with a 78 chance of remaining in remission

the first analysis of this method when applied to the problem of minimizing a smooth convex function was performed by nesterov 2010 in nesterov s analysis the method needs to be applied to a quadratic perturbation of the original function with an unknown scaling factor richt rik and tak 2011 give iteration complexity bounds which do not require this i e the method is applied to the objective function directly furthermore they generalize the setting to the problem of minimizing a composite function i e sum of a smooth convex and a possibly nonsmooth convex block separable function formula 1 where formula 2 formula 3 is decomposed into formula 4 blocks of variables coordinates formula 5 and formula 6 are simple convex functions example block decomposition if formula 7 and formula 8 one may choose formula 9 and formula 10 example block separable regularizers consider the optimization problem where formula 16 is a convex and smooth function smoothness by smoothness we mean the following we assume the gradient of formula 16 is coordinate wise lipschitz continuous with constants formula 18 that is we assume that for all formula 20 and formula 21 where formula 22 denotes the partial derivative with

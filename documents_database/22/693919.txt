power network design includes the analysis and design of such networks as in all engineering this involves tradeoffs the network must have adequate performance be sufficiently reliable but should not use more resources than required the power distribution network distributes power and ground voltages from pad locations to all devices in a design shrinking device dimensions faster switching frequencies and increasing power consumption in deep sub micrometer technologies cause large switching currents to flow in the power and ground networks which degrade performance and reliability a robust power distribution network is essential to ensure reliable operation of circuits on a chip power supply integrity verification is a critical concern in high performance designs due to the resistance of the interconnects constituting the network there is a voltage drop across the network commonly referred to as the ir drop the package supplies currents to the pads of the power grid either by means of package leads in wire bond chips or through c4 bump arrays in flip chip technology although the resistance of package is quite small the inductance of package leads is significant which causes a voltage drop at the pad locations due to the time varying current drawn by

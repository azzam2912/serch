it is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell it is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope breaking down in the lower atmosphere to dioxygen ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet light uv and electrical discharges within the earth s atmosphere it is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere which absorbs most of the sun s ultraviolet uv radiation ozone s odour is reminiscent of chlorine and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as in air ozone s o structure was determined in 1865 the molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be diamagnetic in standard conditions ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet black solid ozone s instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point it is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations ozone is a powerful oxidant far

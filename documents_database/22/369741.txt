either a volumetric or mass flow rate may be determined depending on the calculation associated with the orifice plate it uses the same principle as a venturi nozzle namely bernoulli s principle which states that there is a relationship between the pressure of the fluid and the velocity of the fluid when the velocity increases the pressure decreases and vice versa an orifice plate is a thin plate with a hole in it which is usually placed in a pipe when a fluid whether liquid or gaseous passes through the orifice its pressure builds up slightly upstream of the orifice but as the fluid is forced to converge to pass through the hole the velocity increases and the fluid pressure decreases a little downstream of the orifice the flow reaches its point of maximum convergence the vena contracta see drawing to the right where the velocity reaches its maximum and the pressure reaches its minimum beyond that the flow expands the velocity falls and the pressure increases by measuring the difference in fluid pressure across tappings upstream and downstream of the plate the flow rate can be obtained from bernoulli s equation using coefficients established from extensive research in general

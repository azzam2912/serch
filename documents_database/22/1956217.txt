the shmem acronym was subsequently reverse engineered to mean symmetric hierarchical memory later it was expanded to distributed memory parallel computer clusters and is used as parallel programming interface or as low level interface to build partitioned global address space pgas systems and languages libsma the first shmem library was created by richard smith at cray research in 1993 as a set of thin interfaces to access the cray t3d s inter processor communication hardware shmem has been implemented by cray research sgi cray inc quadrics hp gshmem ibm qlogic mellanox universities of houston and florida there is also open source openshmem shmem laid the foundations for low latency sub microsecond one sided communication after its use on the cray t3e its popularity waned as few machines could deliver the near microsecond latencies necessary to maintain efficiency for its hallmark individual word communication with the advent of popular sub microsecond interconnects shmem has been used to address the necessity of hyper efficient portable parallel communication methods for exascale computing programs written using shmem can be started on several computers connected together with some high performance network supported by used shmem library every computer runs a copy of a program spmd

they are also installed within medians of divided highways to prevent errant vehicles from entering the opposing carriageway of traffic and help to reduce head on collisions some of these barriers designed to be struck from either side are called median barriers traffic barriers can also be used to protect vulnerable areas like school yards pedestrian zones and fuel tanks from errant vehicles while barriers are normally designed to minimize injury to vehicle occupants injuries do occur in collisions with traffic barriers they should only be installed where a collision with the barrier is likely to be less severe than a collision with the hazard behind it where possible it is preferable to remove relocate or modify a hazard rather than shield it with a barrier to make sure they are safe and effective traffic barriers undergo extensive simulated and full scale crash testing before they are approved for general use while crash testing cannot replicate every potential manner of impact testing programs are designed to determine the performance limits of traffic barriers and provide an adequate level of protection to road users roadside hazards must be assessed for the danger they pose to traveling motorists based on size shape

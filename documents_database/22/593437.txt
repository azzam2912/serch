note that nxp and freescale merged in 2015 arm920 based arm926 based arm11 based cortex a8 based cortex a9 based cortex a7 based cortex a72 based arm cortex a53 and or arm cortex m4 based arm cortex a7 based arm cortex a9 based arm cortex a53 based arm cortex a72 based the m core based risc microcontrollers are 32 bit processors specifically designed for low power electronics m core processors like 68000 family processors have a user mode and a supervisor mode and in user mode both see a 32 bit pc and 16 registers each 32 bits the m core instruction set is very different from the 68k instruction set in particular m core is a pure load store machine and all m core instructions are 16 bit while 68k instructions are a variety of lengths however 68k assembly language source code can be mechanically translated to m core assembly language the m core processor core has been licensed by atmel for smart cards see also s32k the time processing unit tpu and enhanced time processing unit etpu are largely autonomous timing peripherals found on some freescale parts note the 56xxx series is commonly known as the 56000 series

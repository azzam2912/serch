the crucial difficulty is that we do not know how much each buyer is willing to pay for an item if we know at least that the valuations of the buyers are random variables with some known probability distribution then we can use a bayesian optimal mechanism but often we do not know the distribution in this case random sampling mechanisms provide an alternative solution when the market is large the following general scheme can be used this scheme is called random sampling empirical myerson rsem the declaration of each buyer has no effect on the price he has to pay the price is determined by the buyers in the other sub market hence it is a dominant strategy for the buyers to reveal their true valuation in other words this is a truthful mechanism intuitively by the law of large numbers if the market is sufficiently large then the empirical distributions are sufficiently similar to the real distributions so we expect the rsem to attain near optimal profit however this is not necessarily true in all cases it has been proved to be true in some special cases the simplest case is digital goods auction there step 4 is

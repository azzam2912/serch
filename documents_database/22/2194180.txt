this decision based on art 130 of the greek act of accession allowed france to restrict imports of cotton yarn from greece piraiki patraiki challenged the decision crucially there was an exporter that had a live contract to export and one that did not the court of justice held that the exporter with the contract was individually concerned as it was part of a closed group and annulled the decision where it was concerned however the exporter without a contract despite being directly concerned affected by the measure was found not to be individually concerned furthermore article 130 imposed an obligation on the commission to take the interests of such exporters into account and the commission had not done so regarding direct concern because possibility that france would not decide to exercise authority was entirely theoretical the discretion was not sufficient in this case to preclude direct concern

the exact consequences of fragmentation depend on the specific system of storage allocation in use and the particular form of fragmentation in many cases fragmentation leads to storage space being wasted and in that case the term also refers to the wasted space itself for other systems e g the fat file system the space used to store given data e g files is the same regardless of the degree of fragmentation from none to extreme there are three different but related forms of fragmentation external fragmentation internal fragmentation and data fragmentation which can be present in isolation or conjunction fragmentation is often accepted in return for improvements in speed or simplicity analogous phenomena occur for other resources such as processors see below when a computer program requests blocks of memory from the computer system the blocks are allocated in chunks when the computer program is finished with a chunk it can free the chunk back to the system making it available to later be allocated again to another or the same program the size and the amount of time a chunk is held by a program varies during its lifespan a computer program can request and free many chunks

as a thermoplastic it can be molded and is therefore also called liquid wood arboform was developed in 1996 by helmut n gele and j rgen pfitzer at the fraunhofer institute for chemical technology in 1998 they founded a spin off company tecnaro and already in 2002 the company produced about 300 tonnes of arboform and was selling it at a price of about 5 5 kg in 2010 n gele and pfitzer received the european inventor award for their work on arboform arboform consists of the two most abundant natural materials lignin ca 30 and cellulose ca 60 the remaining part is natural additives that function as plasticizers dyes antioxidants fillers etc it has a similar composition appearance and properties to those of wood but it can be melted upon heating and molded like a thermoplastic it has been designed to when the amount of cellulose in arboform is increased from 30 to 60 its tensile strength increases from 9 5 to 14 5 n mm and bending stress increases from ca 23 to 39 n mm while the indentation hardness and impact strength remain almost constant at ca 135 n mm and 3 2 mj mm respectively other

several studies indicate a possible link between genetic polymorphisms of this and several other genes to chronic inflammatory barrier diseases such as crohn s disease and sarcoidosis the gene spans 142 366 base pairs and is located at the 10p12 2 locus on the minus or sense strand of chromosome 10 it is flanked upstream by the gene armc3 and downstream by the gene kiaa1217 these genes are approximately 150 000 bp and 350 000 bp from c10orf67 respectively there are 23 alternatively spliced exons which encode 13 transcript variants the primary transcript only 2943 bp is not well conserved among orthologs rather the x2 variant 3417 bp has far greater identity with orthologous proteins this x2 transcript variant contains 15 exons which yield a polypeptide of 551 amino acids depending on post translational modifications ptms from no ptms all possible ptms the isoelectric point is significantly greater than average for human proteins 6 81 shown to the right is a predicted tertiary structure of the protein it is marked by long alpha helices with several coil regions and beta strands localized to the end of the protein opposite the n and c terminal ends c10orf67 is moderately expressed 50

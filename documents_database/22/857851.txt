cohn is a series of purification steps with the purpose of extracting albumin from blood plasma the process is based on the differential solubility of albumin and other plasma proteins based on ph ethanol concentration temperature ionic strength and protein concentration albumin has the highest solubility and lowest isoelectric point of all the major plasma proteins this makes it the final product to be precipitated or separated from its solution in a solid form albumin was an excellent substitute for human plasma in world war two when administered to wounded soldiers or other patients with blood loss it helped expand the volume of blood and led to speedier recovery cohn s method was gentle enough that isolated albumin protein retained its biological activity during the operations the ethanol concentration change from zero initially to 40 the ph decreases from neutral at 7 to more acidic at 4 8 over the course of the fractionation the temperature starts at room temperature and decreases to 5 degrees celsius initially the blood is frozen there are five major fractions each fraction ends with a specific precipitate these precipitates are the separate fractions fractions i ii and iii are precipitated out at earlier stages

it is named after girard desargues arises from several different combinatorial constructions has a high level of symmetry is the only known non planar cubic partial cube and has been applied in chemical databases the name desargues graph has also been used to refer to a ten vertex graph the complement of the petersen graph which can also be formed as the bipartite half of the 20 vertex desargues graph there are several different ways of constructing the desargues graph the desargues graph is a symmetric graph it has symmetries that take any vertex to any other vertex and any edge to any other edge its symmetry group has order 240 and is isomorphic to the product of a symmetric group on 5 points with a group of order 2 one can interpret this product representation of the symmetry group in terms of the constructions of the desargues graph the symmetric group on five points is the symmetry group of the desargues configuration and the order 2 subgroup swaps the roles of the vertices that represent points of the desargues configuration and the vertices that represent lines alternatively in terms of the bipartite kneser graph the symmetric group on five

it contains one species k lafquenianum described in 2016 by o gorman at in body length kawanectes was small for an elasmosaurid it belongs to the non elongated group of elasmosaurids meaning that its cervical vertebrae are not extremely lengthened neither do they show great variability in length the mcs specimen preserves 15 cervical vertebrae and 15 dorsal vertebrae while the holotype preserves 10 caudal vertebrae the true number of cervical and caudal vertebrae is unknown due to the incompleteness of the specimens a combination of traits can be used to distinguish kawanectes from all other elasmosaurids the centra of the vertebrae are wider than they are long the projections known as the parapophyses on the caudal vertebrae are knob like the ischium and pubis form a bar of bone that encloses two diamond shaped openings the ratio between the length of the humerus and the femur is unusually high 1 2 the end of the humerus bears a backward projection of bone which forms an articulating surface and the capitulum of the femur which likewise forms an articulating surface is strongly convex although kawanectes is similar to the somewhat larger vegasaurus its bones clearly represent that of an adult

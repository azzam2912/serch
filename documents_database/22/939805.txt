c jun in combination with c fos forms the ap 1 early response transcription factor it was first identified as the fos binding protein p39 and only later rediscovered as the product of the c jun gene jun was the first oncogenic transcription factor discovered the proto oncogene c jun is the cellular homolog of the viral oncoprotein v jun the viral homolog v jun was discovered in avian sarcoma virus 17 and was named for ju nana the japanese word for 17 the human jun encodes a protein that is highly similar to the viral protein which interacts directly with specific target dna sequences to regulate gene expression this gene is intronless and is mapped to 1p32 p31 a chromosomal region involved in both translocations and deletions in human malignancies both jun and its dimerization partners in ap 1 formation are subject to regulation by diverse extracellular stimuli which include peptide growth factors pro inflammatory cytokines oxidative and other forms of cellular stress and uv irradiation for example uv irradiation is a potent inducer for elevated c jun expression c jun transcription is autoregulated by its own product jun the binding of jun ap 1 to a high affinity

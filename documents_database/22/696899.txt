crsds arise from a persistent pattern of sleep wake disturbances that can be caused either by dysfunction in one s biological clock system or by misalignment between one s endogenous oscillator and externally imposed cues as a result of this mismatch those affected by circadian rhythm sleep disorders have a tendency to fall asleep at unconventional time points in the day these occurrences often lead to recurring instances of disturbed rest where individuals affected by the disorder are unable to go to sleep and awaken at normal times for work school and other social obligations humans like most living organisms have various biological rhythms these biological clocks control processes that fluctuate daily e g body temperature alertness hormone secretion generating circadian rhythms among these physiological characteristics our sleep wake propensity can also be considered one of the daily rhythms regulated by the biological clock system our sleeping cycles are tightly regulated by a series of circadian processes working in tandem which allow us to experience moments of consolidated sleep during the night and a long wakeful moment during the day conversely disruptions to these processes and the communication pathways between them can lead to problems in sleeping patterns which are

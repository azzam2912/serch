it functions as a na dependent transporter this enzyme participates in metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450 meh has been identified as playing a large role in the detoxification and bioactivation of a wide variety of substrates such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs which are known for their carcinogenic properties the human homolog of microsomal epoxide hydrolase is ephx1 and is located on chromosome 1 this enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases specifically those acting on ether bonds ether hydrolases the systematic name of this enzyme class is cis stilbene oxide hydrolase other names in common use include epoxide hydratase ambiguous microsomal epoxide hydratase ambiguous epoxide hydrase microsomal epoxide hydrase arene oxide hydratase ambiguous benzo a pyrene 4 5 oxide hydratase benzo a pyrene 4 5 epoxide hydratase aryl epoxide hydrase ambiguous cis epoxide hydrolase and meh microsomal epoxide hydrolase is a single polypeptide chain composed of 455 amino acids with a molecular weight of 52 96 kilodaltons it is known that the n terminal region of the enzyme is responsible for anchoring the protein to the cell membrane while the c terminal region of the enzyme contains catalytic residues microsomal epoxide hydrolase belongs to the superfamily hydrolase fold

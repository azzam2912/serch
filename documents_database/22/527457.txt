phosphorene can be viewed as a single layer of black phosphorus much in the same way that graphene is a single layer of graphite phosphorene is predicted to be a strong competitor to graphene because in contrast to graphene phosphorene has a band gap phosphorene was first isolated in 2014 by mechanical exfoliation in the 1960s black phosphorus a layered semiconducting allotrope of phosphorus was synthesized which exhibited high carrier mobility in 2014 several groups introduced single layer phosphorene a monolayer of black phosphorus it attracted renewed attention because of its potential in optoelectronics and electronics due to its band gap which can be tuned via modifying its thickness anisotropic photoelectronic properties and high carrier mobility phosphorene was initially prepared using mechanical cleavage a commonly used technique in graphene production that is difficult to scale up liquid exfoliation is a promising method for scalable phosphorene production synthesis of phosphorene is a significant challenge currently there are two main ways of phosphorene production scotch tape based microcleavage and liquid exfoliation while several other methods are being developed as well phosphorene production from plasma etching is also reported in scotch tape based microcleavage phosphorene is mechanically exfoliated from a bulk of black

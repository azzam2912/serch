ferrous alloys and titanium alloys have a distinct limit called the endurance limit which is the amplitude of completely reversed bending stress below which there appears to be no number of cycles that will cause failure other structural metals such as aluminium and copper do not have a distinct limit and will eventually fail even from small stress amplitudes in these cases the term endurance strength is used endurance strength is defined as the maximum value of completely reversed bending stress that a material can withstand for a finite number of cycles without a fatigue failure fatigue limit is used in plotting s n curves and the goodman diagram the astm defines fatigue strength s as the value of stress at which failure occurs after n cycles and fatigue limit s as the limiting value of stress at which failure occurs as n becomes very large astm does not define endurance limit the stress value below which the material will withstand many load cycles but implies that it is similar to fatigue limit some authors use endurance limit s for the stress below which failure never occurs even for an indefinitely large number of loading cycles as in the case

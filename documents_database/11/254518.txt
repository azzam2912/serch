pathogenicity islands are found in both animal and plant pathogens additionally pais are found in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria they are transferred through horizontal gene transfer events such as transfer by a plasmid phage or conjugative transposon therefore pais contribute to microorganisms ability to evolve one species of bacteria may have more than one pai for example salmonella has at least five an analogous genomic structure in rhizobia is termed a symbiosis island pathogenicity islands pais are gene clusters incorporated in the genome chromosomally or extrachromosomally of pathogenic organisms but are usually absent from those nonpathogenic organisms of the same or closely related species they may be located on a bacterial chromosome or may be transferred within a plasmid or can be found in bacteriophage genomes the gc content and codon usage of pathogenicity islands often differs from that of the rest of the genome potentially aiding in their detection within a given dna sequence unless the donor and recipient of the pai have similar gc content pais are discrete genetic units flanked by direct repeats insertion sequences or trna genes which act as sites for recombination into the dna cryptic mobility genes may also be present

since there are no known conditions where stars devoid of hydrogen can be formed from molecular clouds it is theorized that they are the product of the mergers of helium core and carbon oxygen core white dwarfs extreme helium stars form a sub group within the broader category of hydrogen deficient stars the latter includes cool carbon stars like r coronae borealis helium rich spectral class o or b stars population i wolf rayet stars am cvn stars white dwarfs of spectral type wc and transition stars like pg 1159 the first known extreme helium star hd 124448 was discovered in 1942 by daniel m popper at the mcdonald observatory in austin texas usa this star displayed no lines of hydrogen in its spectrum but strong helium lines as well as the presence of carbon and oxygen the second pv telescopii was discovered in 1952 and by 1996 a total of 25 candidates had been found this list was narrowed to 21 by 2006 a common characteristic of these stars is that the abundance ratio of carbon to helium is always in the range of 0 3 to 1 this is despite wide variation of other abundance ratios in ehe

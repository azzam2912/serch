there are two known paralogs in the human genome tpc1s and tpc2s in humans tpc1s are sodium selective and tpc2s conduct sodium ions calcium ions and possibly hydrogen ions plant tpc1s are non selective channels expression of tpcs are found in both plant vacuoles and animal acidic organelles these organelles consist of endosomes and lysosomes tpcs are formed from two transmembrane non equivalent tandem shaker like pore forming subunits dimerized to form quasi tetramers quasi tetramers appear very similar to tetramers but are not quite the same some key roles of tpcs include calcium dependent responses in muscle contraction s hormone secretion fertilization and differentiation disorders linked to tpcs include membrane trafficking parkinson s disease ebola and fatty liver as implied by their name tpc channels possess two pores and were named for their two shaker like repeats which each have a pore domain this contrasts with two pore domain potassium channels which confusingly have only one pore and were named for the fact that each subunit has two p pore domains in its primary sequence although much is left to be discovered about tpc function they have been extensively studied thus far many questions have been raised about the

it is basically synonymous to flagella and cilia which are differing terms for similar molecular structures used on different types of cells the name was coined to differentiate from the analogous structures present in prokaryotic cells it is structurally a complex of microtubules along with motor proteins the usage of the term was early supported by lynn margulis especially in support of endosymbiotic theory the eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and or length undulipodia use a whip like action to create movement of the whole cell such as the movement of sperm in the reproductive tract and also create water movement as in the choanocytes of sponges motile or secondary cilia are more numerous with multiple cilia per cell move in a wave like action and are responsible for movement in organisms such as ciliates and platyhelminthes but also move extracellular substances in animals such as the ciliary escalator found in the respiratory tract of mammals and the corona of rotifers primary cilia function as sensory antennae but are not undulipodia as primary cilia do not have the rotary movement mechanism found in motile cilia undulipodia are an extension

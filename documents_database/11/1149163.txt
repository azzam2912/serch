it is the fastest deterministic algorithm known for numbers of that form for numbers of the form n k 2 1 proth numbers either application of proth s theorem a las vegas algorithm or one of the deterministic proofs described in brillhart lehmer selfridge 1975 are used the algorithm is very similar to the lucas lehmer test but with a variable starting point depending on the value of k define a sequence u for all i 0 by then n is prime if and only if it divides u the starting value u is determined as follows an alternative method for finding the starting value u is given in r dseth 1994 the selection method is much easier than that used by riesel for the 3 divides k case first find a p value that satisfies the following equalities of jacobi symbols in practice only a few p values need be checked before one is found 5 8 9 or 11 work in about 85 of trials to find the starting value u from the p value we can use a lucas p 1 sequence as shown in as well as page 124 of the latter explains that when 3

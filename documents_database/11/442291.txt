the system developed by io2 technology in 2001 uses a projection unit focused onto multiple layers of air and dry micron size atomized particles in mid air resulting in a two dimensional display that appears to float 3d when using 3d content this is similar in principle to the cinematic technique of rear projection and can appear three dimensional when using appropriate content as dark areas of the image may appear invisible the image may be more realistic than on a projection screen although it is still not volumetric however the system does allow for multiple viewing and dual viewing back and front when combined with two light sources the necessity of an oblique viewing angle 30 degrees may be required for various configurations due the rear projection requirement heliodisplay can operate as a free space touchscreen when the equipment is ordered as an interactive unit with embedded sensors in the equipment the original prototype of 2001 used a pc that sees the heliodisplay as a pointing device like a mouse with the supplied software installed one can use a finger pen or another object as cursor control and navigate or interact with simple content as of 2010 no computer

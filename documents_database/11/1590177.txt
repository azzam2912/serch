in general viruses cannot leave behind physical fossils therefore indirect evidence is used to reconstruct the past for example viruses can cause evolution of their hosts and the signatures of that evolution can be found and interpreted in the present day also some viral genetic fragments which were integrated into germline cells of an ancient organism have been passed down to our time as viral fossils or endogenous viral elements eves eves that originate from the integration of retroviruses are known as endogenous retroviruses or ervs and most viral fossils are ervs they may preserve genetic code from millions of years go hence the fossil terminology although no one has detected a virus in mineral fossils the most surprising viral fossils originate from non retroviral dna and rna viruses although there is no formal classification system for eves they are categorised according to the taxonomy of their viral origin indeed all known viral genome types and replication strategies as defined by the baltimore classification have been found in the genomic fossil record acronyms have been designated to describe different types of viral fossil other viral fossils originate from dna viruses such as hepadnaviruses a group that includes hepatitis b successful

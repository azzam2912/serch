this is the first ef s lens made by canon to offer both wide angle and telephoto shooting range in the same package other manufacturers including sigma and tamron have had similar lenses available for ef s cameras for some time however their lenses generally only work at 6 3 when fully zoomed in which can make autofocusing unreliable canon s aps c cameras are only designed to autofocus up to 5 6 canon s version is a third of a stop faster when fully zoomed in which means that autofocusing is more reliable and the lens is slightly faster as well it is almost functionally identical to the canon 28 300l lens which also has image stabilization and comparable apertures and focal lengths when mounted on a 35mm or full frame camera reviews indicate that the 18 200 does not compare to the 28 300l in terms of image quality though this is understandable since the latter is priced much higher due to it belonging to the l series line most reviewers have criticised the lens for high levels of barrel distortion at the wide end and chromatic aberration and softness evident at all focal lengths and apertures the

this number of donor atoms that bind is called denticity and is a way to classify ligands tetradentate ligands are common in nature in the form of chlorophyll which has a core ligand called chlorin and heme with a core ligand called porphyrin they add much of the colour seen in plants and humans phthalocyanine is an artificial macrocyclic tetradentate ligand that is used to make blue and green pigments tetradentate ligands can be classified by the topology of the connections between the donor atoms common forms are linear also called sequential ring or tripodal a tetrapodal ligand that is also tetradentate has four legs with donor atoms and a bridgehead that is not a donor on binding with a central atom there are several arrangements possible called geometric isomers a linear tetradentate ligand has the four donor atoms in a line each subsequent donor is connected by one of three bridges a linear tetradetate ligand bound to a metal in tetrahedral coordination can only connect in one way if the ligand is unsymmetrical then there are two chiral arrangements a linear tetradetate ligand bound to a metal in square planar coordination in one way anticlockwise or clockwise arrangements are

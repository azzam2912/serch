this produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses without interneurons at the level of l3 in the spinal cord completely independent of higher centres from there an alpha motor neuron conducts an efferent impulse back to the quadriceps femoris muscle triggering contraction this contraction coordinated with the relaxation of the antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle causes the leg to kick this is a reflex of proprioception which helps maintain posture and balance allowing to keep one s balance with little effort or conscious thought the patellar reflex is a clinical and classic example of the monosynaptic reflex arc there is no interneuron in the pathway leading to contraction of the quadriceps muscle instead the sensory neuron synapses directly on a motor neuron in the spinal cord however there is an inhibitory interneuron used to relax the antagonistic hamstring muscle reciprocal innervation this test of a basic automatic reflex may be influenced by the patient consciously inhibiting or exaggerating the response the doctor may use the jendrassik maneuver as a distraction or diversion in order to ensure a more valid reflex test after the tap of a hammer the leg is normally extended once and comes to

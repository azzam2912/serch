similar to the bones of a spine protecting the spinal cord casing is set inside the drilled borehole to protect and support the wellstream the lower portion and sometimes the entirety is typically held in place with cement deeper strings usually are not cemented all the way to the surface so the weight of the pipe must be partially supported by a casing hanger in the wellhead casing that is cemented in place aids the drilling process in several ways optimum design of the casing program decreases the well construction costs enhances the efficiency of operations and also diminishes the environmental impacts a slightly different metal string called production tubing is often used without cement inside the final casing string of a well to contain production fluids and convey them to the surface from an underground reservoir in the planning stages of a well a drilling engineer usually with input from geologists and others will pick strategic depths at which the hole will need to be cased in order for drilling to reach the desired total depth this decision is often based on subsurface data such as formation pressures and strengths well integrity and is balanced against the cost objectives

words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy for example the words begin start commence and initiate are all synonyms of one another words are typically synonymous in one particular sense for example long and extended in the context long time or extended time are synonymous but long cannot be used in the phrase extended family synonyms with exactly the same meaning share a seme or denotational sememe whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field the former are sometimes called cognitive synonyms and the latter near synonyms plesionyms or poecilonyms some lexicographers claim that no synonyms have exactly the same meaning in all contexts or social levels of language because etymology orthography phonic qualities connotations ambiguous meanings usage and so on make them unique different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason feline is more formal than cat long and extended are only synonyms in one usage and not in others for example a long arm is not the same as an extended arm synonyms are also a source of euphemisms metonymy

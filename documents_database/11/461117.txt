it is named after the gray color of the fracture it forms which is due to the presence of graphite it is the most common cast iron and the most widely used cast material based on weight it is used for housings where the stiffness of the component is more important than its tensile strength such as internal combustion engine cylinder blocks pump housings valve bodies electrical boxes and decorative castings grey cast iron s high thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are often exploited to make cast iron cookware and disc brake rotors a typical chemical composition to obtain a graphitic microstructure is 2 5 to 4 0 carbon and 1 to 3 silicon by weight graphite may occupy 6 to 10 of the volume of grey iron silicon is important for making grey iron as opposed to white cast iron because silicon is a graphite stabilizing element in cast iron which means it helps the alloy produce graphite instead of iron carbides at 3 silicon almost no carbon is held in chemical form as iron carbide another factor affecting graphitization is the solidification rate the slower the rate the greater the time for the carbon to diffuse and

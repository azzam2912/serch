it is an amine derivative of biphenyl it is a colorless solid although aged samples can appear colored 4 aminobiphenyl was commonly used in the past as a rubber antioxidant and an intermediate for dyes exposure to this aryl amine can happen through contact with chemical dyes and from inhalation of cigarette smoke researches showed that 4 aminobiphenyl is responsible for bladder cancer in humans and dogs by damaging dna due to its carcinogenic effects commercial production of 4 aminobiphenyl ceased in the united states in the 1950s like other aniline derivatives 4 aminobiphenyl is weakly basic it is prepared by reduction of 4 nitrobiphenyl which together with the 2 nitro derivatives is obtained by nitration of biphenyl another reaction to synthesize 4 aminobiphenyl can be obtained by using 4 azidobiphenyl this can be done by reacting 4 azidobiphenyl with diphosphorus tetraiodide pi which can cleave the nitrogen nitrogen bond this reaction is done in benzene and later on water is added to promote the formation of amine 4 aminobiphenyl causes dna damage which is thought to be mediated by formation of dna adducts in this process 4 aminobiphenyl is oxidized in the liver giving the n hydroxy derivative 4

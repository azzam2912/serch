this unique lone pair on the phosphide ligands in the transition metal phosphide complex gives some properties which have been used in organic synthesis the key step for the synthesis of transition metal phosphido complex is to install the phosphorus containing ligand on to the metal center the most common way is to react with alkali metal phosphido compounds one of the drawbacks for this method is that these reagents may reduce the metal center for example the electron rich ni ii spices shown below is reduced to the ni i by the phosphide anions for early transition metal complexes the reduction of metal center is rarely happened and the salt elimination reaction takes place another way to generate the transition metal phosphido complexes are by direct activation of p h bonds and is mostly seen in the late transition metal complexes for example the reaction of vaska s complex analogs with the parent phosphine generate the following transition metal phosphido complex the structures of phosphido complex can be basically summarized in the two resonance structure a and structure b in the resonance structure a the lone pair from the p orbital on phosphorus donates to the vacant orbital on

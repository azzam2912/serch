c7orf43 has no other human alias but in mice can be found as bc037034 in humans c7orf43 is located in the long arm of human chromosome 7 7q22 1 and is on the negative antisense strand genes located around c7orf43 include gal3st4 lamtor4 gpc2 in humans c7orf43 has 9 detected common single nucleotide polymorphisms snps all of which are located in non coding regions and thus do not affect amino acid sequence c7orf43 encodes 2 isoforms the longest being c7orf43 isoform 1 which is 2585 base pairs long and has with 11 exons and 10 introns c7orf43 isoform 1 encodes a protein that is 580 amino acids long and only has one polyadenylation site c7orf43 isoform 2 is 2085 base pairs long and encodes a protein of 311 amino acids two additional isoforms has been reported on several occasions encoding for proteins with 199 and 206 amino acids c7orf43 has a widespread moderate expression with tissue to tissue variability in humans and across mammalian species the mouse c7orf43 ortholog has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed in the brain as well as in the mouse embryonic central nervous system c7orf43 has one promoter region upstream of its transcription site as

they also inherit from glms the idea of extending linear mixed models to non normal data glmms provide a broad range of models for the analysis of grouped data since the differences between groups can be modelled as a random effect these models are useful in the analysis of many kinds of data including longitudinal data fitting glmms via maximum likelihood as via aic involves integrating over the random effects in general those integrals cannot be expressed in analytical form various approximate methods have been developed but none has good properties for all possible models and data sets e g ungrouped binary data are particularly problematic for this reason methods involving numerical quadrature or markov chain monte carlo have increased in use as increasing computing power and advances in methods have made them more practical the akaike information criterion aic is a common criterion for model selection estimates of aic for glmms based on certain exponential family distributions have recently been obtained

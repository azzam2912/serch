the model is developed and supported by researchers at the alfred wegener institute helmholtz centre for polar and marine research awi in bremerhaven germany fesom implements the idea of using meshes with variable resolution to simulate the circulation of the global ocean with regional focus because of the broad range of scales characterizing the ocean circulation downscaling is commonly needed to describe processes on regional scales fesom allows global multi resolution cross scale simulations without traditional nesting the dynamical core of the new version fesom2 switches from the finite element method used in the original version of fesom to the finite volume method for the sake of better computational efficiency both versions include the finite element sea ice model fesim fesom is also used as the ocean component of the awi cm the coupled atmosphere ocean climate model developed at awi the prototype version of fesom appeared in 2004 due to work of sergey danilov gennady kivman and jens schr ter ralph timmermann extended it to a full global ocean sea ice configuration in 2009 qiang wang rewrote its numerical algorithm and parameterizations from 2008 through 2014 which led to essentially improved numerical and physical performance the last release of

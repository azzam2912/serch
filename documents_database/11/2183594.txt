the protein contains the domain of unknown function 4605 duf4605 which belongs to the protein family pfam15378 this gene is located at locus 10q22 1 the physical properties of the c10orf35 protein were analyzed and the molecular weight was predicted to be 13 2 kdal and the isoelectric point was predicted to be 11 5 the properties of duf4605 were also analyzed and the molecular weight was predicted to be 6 0 kdal the isoelectric point was predicted to be 6 9 which is significantly less basic than the full protein this protein includes a highly conserved region between amino acids 1 and 19 discovered by msa duf 4605 is located between amino acids 62 and 92 the secondary structure of the c10orf35 protein was predicted to consist of a sheet between amino acids 3 and 5 an helix between 61 and 72 and a transmembrane helix between 92 and 112 the serine in position 62 can be phosphorylated to form a phosphoserine group the protein of interest has a similar paralogous domain found in c4orf32 which is conserved in mammals birds very few reptiles and one amphibian the protein coded for by c10orf35 has many orthologs found mainly in

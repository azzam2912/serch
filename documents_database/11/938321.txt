it is encoded by the lemd3 gene and was first identified after it was isolated from the serum of a patient with a collagen vascular disease the protein is 82 3 kda and has a 40 amino acid long lem domain located at its amino terminal region in its carboxyl end it has a rna recognition motif rrm the lem domain is also common to two other integral proteins of the inm lamina associated polypeptide 2 lap2 and emerin the lem segment enables lemd3 to attach to the barrier to autointegration factor baf and therefore indirectly interact with the chromatin lemd3 also has several implications in regulating the cytokine family such as the transforming growth factor beta tgf and bone morphogenic protein bmps the rrm domain in its carboxylic region attaches to the smad protein proteins which is involved in mediating tgf cellular signalling consequently lemd3 indirectly regulates downstream genes lemd3 seems to play an important role in regulating the expression of several fundamental genes lemd3 has been associated with laminopathies as well as osteopoikilosis mutations in the lemd3 gene have been linked to several genetic diseases such as osteopoikilosis melorheostosis and buschke ollendorff syndrome inner nuclear membrane proteins

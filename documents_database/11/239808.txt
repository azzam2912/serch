the actual topology has no hierarchy queries are resolved by matching prefixes this also determines the choice of routing table entries each peer for each level of the trie maintains autonomously routing entries chosen randomly from the complementary sub trees in fact multiple entries are maintained for each level at each peer to provide fault tolerance as well as potentially for query load management for diverse reasons including fault tolerance and load balancing multiple peers are responsible for each leaf node in the p grid tree these are called replicas the replica peers maintain an independent replica sub network and uses gossip based communication to keep the replica group up to date the redundancy in both the replication of key space partitions as well as the routing network together is called structural replication the figure above shows how a query is resolved by forwarding it based on prefix matching p grid partitions the key space in a granularity adaptive to the load at that part of the key space consequently its possible to realize a p grid overlay network where each peer has similar storage load even for non uniform load distributions this network probably provides as efficient search of

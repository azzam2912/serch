the area owes its name to the three flat mesas or butte hills cerros aligned in a row from the biggest in the south to the smallest in the north which dominate the horizon their names are cerro zapato or alpargata meaning shoe because of its shape as seen from above the biggest of the three cerro del medio meaning hill of the middle and cerro chapeu meaning hat in portuguese being the smallest the hills are mostly bare except for a few native woodland trees around the brim of the table tops cerro zapato has some eucalyptus trees that were planted along its north eastern flank and the eastern part of its top surface access to the area is made difficult by sporadic flooding which cuts off the main access bridges paso rogelio over the tacuaremb river and paso cunha over the stream arroyo cu apir that cross the two rivers this flooding has become much less frequent in recent years due to extensive planting of eucalyptus and pine forests especially in the tacuaremb river basin

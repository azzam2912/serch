it studies how economic behavior can shape our understanding of the brain and how neuroscientific discoveries can constrain and guide models of economics it combines research from neuroscience experimental and behavioral economics and cognitive and social psychology as research into decision making behavior becomes increasingly computational it has also incorporated new approaches from theoretical biology computer science and mathematics neuroeconomics studies decision making by using a combination of tools from these fields so as to avoid the shortcomings that arise from a single perspective approach in mainstream economics expected utility eu and the concept of rational agents are still being used many economic behaviors are not fully explained by these models such as heuristics and framing behavioral economics emerged to account for these anomalies by integrating social cognitive and emotional factors in understanding economic decisions neuroeconomics adds another layer by using neuroscientific methods in understanding the interplay between economic behavior and neural mechanisms by using tools from various fields some scholars claim that neuroeconomics offers a more integrative way of understanding decision making the field of decision making is largely concerned with the processes by which individuals make a single choice from among many options these processes are generally assumed

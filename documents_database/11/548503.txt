people normally have two copies of this chromosome chromosome 6 spans more than 170 million base pairs the building material of dna and represents between 5 5 and 6 of the total dna in cells it contains the major histocompatibility complex which contains over 100 genes related to the immune response and plays a vital role in organ transplantation the human leukocyte antigen lies on chromosome 6 with the exception of the gene for 2 microglobulin which is located on chromosome 15 and encodes cell surface antigen presenting proteins among other functions in 2003 the entirety of chromosome 6 was manually annotated for proteins resulting in the identification of 1 557 genes and 633 pseudogenes the following are some of the newer gene count estimates because researchers use different approaches to genome annotation their predictions of the number of genes on each chromosome varies for technical details see gene prediction among various projects the collaborative consensus coding sequence project ccds takes an extremely conservative strategy so ccds s gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein coding genes the following is a partial list of genes on human chromosome 6 for complete list see

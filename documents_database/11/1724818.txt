it has been well received by critics in june 2006 a group of arch linux users initiated the kdemod packaging project to improve and simplify a standard kde installation with arch linux in december 2008 the group released their first custom made iso with a preconfigured arch kdemod tribe after several releases lead developer jan mette suggested to split from arch to allow for a much closer integration with kde software on august 30 2010 the first independent version called chakra 0 2 was released this ended the development on kdemod and the project was renamed to the chakra project chakra includes both free and proprietary software though the latter may be disabled during installation it is only available for the x86 64 architecture with support for i686 having been dropped in august 2012 it is based on kde software compilation chakra does not schedule releases for specific dates but uses a half rolling release system this means that the core packages of chakra graphics audio etc are frozen and only updated to fix any security problems these packages are updated after the latest versions have been thoroughly tested before being moved to permanent repository about every six months this

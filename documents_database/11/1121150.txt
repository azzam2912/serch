among these it belongs to a distinct lineage which is variously treated as tribe chelariini in subfamilies dichomeridinae like done here gelechiinae or even pexicopiinae and historically was considered a subfamily in its own right chelariinae of this lineage hypatima under its junior synonym chelaria is the type genus this genus has numerous species but its exact limits are not quite clear see below this genus occurs mainly in the southern hemisphere though one of the better known species is the only member of this genus native to europe the lobster clawed moth h rhomboidella species of hypatima include the genus hypatima was established by jacob h bner about 1825 though some authors mistakenly credited g a w herrich sch ffer to have done it about 1853 herrich sch ffer however only cited the genus as established by h bner as regards chelaria this has been treated as distinct genus by several authors but this was based on the mistaken assumption that its type species chelaria conscripta was a distinct taxon however it is merely an unjustified name change of hypatima conscriptella and hence hypatima and chelaria are objective synonyms a group within this genus is remarkably similar to chelophoba

the algorithm was the first to determine whether any given number is prime or composite within polynomial time the authors received the 2006 g del prize and the 2006 fulkerson prize for this work aks is the first primality proving algorithm to be simultaneously general polynomial deterministic and unconditional previous algorithms had been developed for centuries and achieved three of these properties at most but not all four while the algorithm is of immense theoretical importance it is not used in practice rendering it a galactic algorithm for 64 bit inputs the baillie psw primality test is deterministic and runs many orders of magnitude faster for larger inputs the performance of the also unconditionally correct ecpp and apr tests is far superior to aks additionally ecpp can output a primality certificate that allows independent and rapid verification of the results which is not possible with the aks algorithm the aks primality test is based upon the following theorem given an integer formula 1 and integer formula 2 coprime to formula 3 formula 3 is prime if and only if the polynomial congruence relation holds note that formula 5 should be understood as a formal symbol this theorem is a generalization

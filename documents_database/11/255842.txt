comparable to a compressor which attenuates signals above a threshold such as loud attacks from the start of musical notes noise gates attenuate signals that register below the threshold however noise gates attenuate signals by a fixed amount known as the range in its simplest form a noise gate allows a main signal to pass through only when it is above a set threshold the gate is open if the signal falls below the threshold no signal is allowed to pass or the signal is substantially attenuated the gate is closed a noise gate is used when the level of the signal is above the level of the unwanted noise the threshold is set above the level of the noise and so when there is no main signal the gate is closed a common application is with electric guitar to remove hum and hiss noise caused by distortion effects units a noise gate does not remove noise from the signal itself when the gate is open both the signal and the noise will pass through even though the signal and the unwanted noise are both present in open gate status the noise is not as noticeable the noise becomes most

as such integrated quantum photonics provides a promising approach to the miniaturization and optical scaling of optical quantum circuits major areas of application of integrated quantum photonics include quantum computing quantum communication quantum simulation quantum walks and quantum metrology quantum photonics is the science of generating manipulating and detecting light in regimes where it is possible to coherently control individual quanta of the light field photons quantum photonics is generally recognised as being a fundamental field in exploring quantum phenomena quantum photonics is also expected to play a central role in advancing future technologies such as quantum information processing qip photons are particularly attractive carriers of quantum information due to their low decoherence properties light speed transmission and ease of manipulation single photons were used for the very first violations of bells inequality and are employed within many highly successful proof of principle demonstrations of emerging quantum technologies the most common implementation of quantum photonics employs linear optical components such as beamsplitters mirrors and wave plates such realizations of quantum photonics have been used to implement linear optical quantum computation loqc however such experiments suffer from several optical scaling problems as the size of the experiments are increased these problems

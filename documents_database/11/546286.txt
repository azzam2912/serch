these joints are of the condyloid kind formed by the reception of the rounded heads of the metacarpal bones into shallow cavities on the proximal ends of the proximal phalanges being condyloid they allow the movements of flexion extension abduction adduction and circumduction at the joint each joint has the dorsal surfaces of these joints are covered by the expansions of the extensor tendons together with some loose areolar tissue which connects the deep surfaces of the tendons to the bones the movements which occur in these joints are flexion extension adduction abduction and circumduction the movements of abduction and adduction are very limited and cannot be performed while the fingers form a fist the muscles of flexion and extension are as follows arthritis of the mcp is a distinguishing feature of rheumatoid arthritis as opposed to the distal interphalangeal joint in osteoarthritis in many quadrupeds particularly horses and other larger animals the metacarpophalangeal joint is referred to as the fetlock this term is translated literally as foot lock in fact although the term fetlock does not specifically apply to other species metacarpophalangeal joints for instance humans the second or mid finger knuckle of the human hand does anatomically correspond

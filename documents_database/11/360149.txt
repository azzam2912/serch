the shorter of the two pathways the digestive loop takes food from the stomach to the common channel the much longer pathway the biliopancreatic loop carries bile from the liver to the common channel the common channel is the portion of small intestine usually 75 150 centimeters long in which the contents of the digestive path mix with the bile from the biliopancreatic loop before emptying into the large intestine the objective of this arrangement is to reduce the amount of time the body has to capture calories from food in the small intestine and to selectively limit the absorption of fat as a result following surgery these patients absorb only approximately 20 of the fat they consume the primary advantage of duodenal switch ds surgery is that its combination of moderate intake restriction with substantial calorie malabsorption results in a higher percentage of excess weight loss versus a purely restrictive gastric bypass for all individuals in a systemic meta analysis of the weight loss surgical procedures buckwald et al type 2 diabetics have had a 98 cure i e became euglycemic almost immediately following surgery which is due to the metabolic effect from the intestine switch the results are

it interfaces with the pmes across the interface and to the mac phy rate matching function using an abstract interface paf is an optional function which was defined before 2007 for two ieee 802 3 interfaces 2base tl and 10pass ts both of which were ethernet in the first mile efm copper physical layers pme aggregation function has the following characteristics paf transmit function works by fragmenting incoming ethernet frames into a number of fragments limited in size to a range between 64 and 512 bytes a sequential fragmentation header is prepended to each fragment indicating if the fragment is from the start of packet end of packet or middle of packet a frame check sequence fcs is appended to each fragment which is then transmitted by the next available active pme in the aggregated group the following diagram illustrates the paf fragmentation paf receive function reassembles the original frames from the received fragments which are buffered in a per mac fragment buffer the algorithm uses the fragmentation header to make sure that the reassembled frames are in order the pme aggregation function was first defined in ieee 802 3ah in 2004 the original loop aggregation proposal was submitted by

in other words and thus is the dimension of the manifold christoffel symbols satisfy the symmetry relations the second of which is equivalent to the torsion freeness of the levi civita connection the contracting relations on the christoffel symbols are given by and where g is the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor formula 11 these are useful when dealing with divergences and laplacians see below the covariant derivative of a vector field with components formula 12 is given by and similarly the covariant derivative of a formula 14 tensor field with components formula 15 is given by for a formula 17 tensor field with components formula 18 this becomes and likewise for tensors with more indices the covariant derivative of a function scalar formula 20 is just its usual differential because the levi civita connection is metric compatible the covariant derivatives of metrics vanish as well as the covariant derivatives of the metric s determinant and volume element the geodesic formula 24 starting at the origin with initial speed formula 12 has taylor expansion in the chart if one defines the curvature operator as formula 27 and the coordinate components of the formula 28 riemann curvature

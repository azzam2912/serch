although the ttf was meant to be notation independent the original presentation was made using the z formal notation it is one of the few mbt frameworks approaching unit testing the ttf is a specific proposal of model based testing mbt it considers models to be z specifications each operation within the specification is analyzed to derive or generate abstract test cases this analysis consists of the following steps one of the main advantages of the ttf is that all of these concepts are expressed in the same notation of the specification i e the z notation hence the engineer has to know only one notation to perform the analysis down to the generation of abstract test cases in this section the main concepts defined by the ttf are described let formula 1 be a z operation let formula 2 be all the input and non primed state variables referenced in formula 1 and formula 4 their corresponding types the input space is of formula 1 written formula 6 is the z schema box defined by formula 7 let formula 1 be a z operation let formula 9 be the precondition of formula 1 the valid input space vis of

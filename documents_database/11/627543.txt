he played a major role in the development of mixed valence chemistry and has carried out important and elegant experimental and theoretical work on the spectra magnetic properties and conductivity of solid inorganic complexes as a young researcher he gave the first theoretically consistent description of the visible ultraviolet spectra of vitamin b12 and its derivatives later he put the assignment of inorganic charge transfer spectra on a more rigorous basis he correlated structures and physical properties of metal chain compounds and identified the first optically transparent ferromagnetic compounds by combined optical and neutron scattering methods he also measured and systematised the optical properties of metamagnets peter day s graduate work initiated the study of mixed valence compounds and led to the robin day classification of such species in 2012 he published a memoir about his life in science peter has received awards from both the royal society and the royal society of chemistry the latter named one of its awards in materials chemistry after him he has served many national and international agencies and institutions both professional and governmental and holds numerous honorary degrees and fellowships day was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1986 and

it considers neural characteristics as phenotypes i e manifestations measurable or not of the genetic make up of an individual and is mainly based on the observation that the nervous systems of individuals even of those belonging to the same species may not be identical as the name implies it draws aspects from both the studies of neuroscience and genetics focusing in particular how the genetic code an organism carries affects its expressed traits mutations in this genetic sequence can have a wide range of effects on the quality of life of the individual neurological diseases behavior and personality are all studied in the context of neurogenetics the field of neurogenetics emerged in the mid to late 1900s with advances closely following advancements made in available technology currently neurogenetics is the center of much research utilizing cutting edge techniques the field of neurogenetics emerged from advances made in molecular biology genetics and a desire to understand the link between genes behavior the brain and neurological disorders and diseases the field started to expand in the 1960s through the research of seymour benzer considered by some to be the father of neurogenetics his pioneering work with drosophila helped to elucidate the

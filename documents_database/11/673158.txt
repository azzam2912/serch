it forms a double star with 11 camelopardalis which is only 3 arcminutes away the system has the variable star designation bm camelopardalis 12 camelopardalis is the flamsteed designation it is just visible to the naked eye appearing as a dim orange hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 6 08 the system is moving closer to the earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of 2 km s abt et al 1969 determined this to be a single lined spectroscopic binary system and computed an orbital solution with a period of 80 17 days and an eccentricity of 0 35 however what appeared to be an ellipticity effect with a period of was found which was inconsistent with the computed orbit and the lack of modulation of the amplitude did not fit with the large orbital eccentricity hall et al 1995 made additional measurements finding an orbital period of 80 9 days and an eccentricity that is statistically indistinguishable from zero the visible component is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of k0 iiie showing strong emission lines it is an rs canum venaticorum variable and its brightness varies by 0 14 magnitudes with a period of

many ores are suitable for direct reduction direct reduction refers to solid state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting point of iron reduced iron derives its name from these processes one example being heating iron ore in a furnace at a high temperature of in the presence of the reducing gas syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide direct reduction processes can be divided roughly into two categories gas based and coal based in both cases the objective of the process is to drive off the oxygen contained in various forms of iron ore sized ore concentrates pellets mill scale furnace dust etc in order to convert the ore to metallic iron without melting it below the direct reduction process is comparatively energy efficient steel made using dri requires significantly less fuel in that a traditional blast furnace is not needed dri is most commonly made into steel using electric arc furnaces to take advantage of the heat produced by the dri product in modern times direct reduction processes have been developed to specifically overcome the difficulties of conventional blast furnaces dri is successfully manufactured in various parts of the world and

hull in his 1943 book titled principles of behavior he defined it as reactive inhibition is a typically studied in the context of drive reduction hull likens it to fatigue through which humans become tired over time and thus less accurate and precise within a given task there is significant debate whether the process of reactive inhibition is due to fatigue or some other process nevertheless it is a factor researchers need to consider in analyses of sustained performance due to its possible role in the results and analysis of research hull goes onto to further explain the decay of performance through the use of a decay formula which can estimate the rate of performance deterioration hull explains i dissipates exponentially with time t with the passage of time since its formation i spontaneously dissipates approximately as a simple decay function of the time t elapsed i e with formula 3 formula 4 is the inhibition at the beginning the time interval 0 t note that if one takes the natural logarithm of both sides one obtains where formula 6 and formula 7 the last formula is used in inhibition theory reactive inhibition is distinct from proactive inhibition reactive inhibition

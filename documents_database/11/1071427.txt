the form genus was put forwards by dianne edwards and is diagnosed by inwards pointing flanges and randomly oriented pseudo cellular units projections on the outer surface are always present and sometimes also appear on the inner surface however the surface of the cuticle itself is always smooth the holes in the cuticle are often covered by round flaps loosely attached along a side where nematothallus was sometimes used to relate only to tube like structures cosmochlaina was used in reference to the cuticle fragments material discovered later revealed its internal anatomy which comprises a lichen like mat of hyphae it has been suggested that the pores of cosmochlaina represent broken off rhizoids on the basis that rotting and acid treatment of extant liverworts produces a similar perforated texture however the status of this form genus in any one kingdom is not secure members could for example represent arthropod cuticle alternatively different species may in fact represent different parts of the same organism based on the more recent material a lichen affinity seems most plausible

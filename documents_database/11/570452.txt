purposeful introgression is a long term process it may take many hybrid generations before the backcrossing occurs introgression differs from simple hybridization introgression results in a complex mixture of parental genes while simple hybridization results in a more uniform mixture which in the first generation will be an even mix of two parental species natural introgression does not have human direct interference while the exotic introgression is induced intentionally as for instance genetically modified organisms or not introgression or introgressive hybridization is the incorporation usually via hybridization and backcrossing of alleles from one entity species into the gene pool of a second divergent entity species introgression is an important source of genetic variation in natural populations and may contribute to adaptation and even adaptive radiation it can occur across hybrid zones due to chance selection or hybrid zone movement there is evidence that introgression is a ubiquitous phenomenon in plants animals and even humans in which it may have introduced the microcephalin d allele it has been proposed that historically domestic animals have had a limited number of domestication situations followed by long periods of introgression where they have acquired the genetic material of wild animals in their dna introgressive

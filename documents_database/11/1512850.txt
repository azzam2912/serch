the abundantly fossiliferous nodular limestone at the base overlies the calico overlying this is 5 to 6 m of fragmental calcarenite containing abundant crinoid columnals above the calcarenite is 6 m of fossiliferous banded calcisiltite the uppermost 15 m is a sequence alternating between laminated stromatolitic calcisiltite and calcilutite and calcisiltite that are argillaceous and fossiliferous the depositional environment of the keyser is interpreted as shallow marine and tidal flats occurring in cycles contact with tonoloway formation is probably conformable but sharp enough to suggest an unconformity upper contact with the old port formation is conformable the keyser was divided into three members by j w head in 1972 these are from lowest to highest the byers island member jersey shore member and la vale member the type locality of the byers island member is at selinsgrove pennsylvania where it is 93 feet thick the type locality of the jersey shore member is at jersey shore lycoming county pennsylvania the type locality of the la vale member is at the corriganville quarry allegany county maryland and is named for the nearby town of la vale this nomenclature is accepted by the usgs in virginia and west virginia the keyser is

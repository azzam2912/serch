the process involves simply re melting the metal which is far less expensive and energy intensive than creating new aluminium through the electrolysis of aluminium oxide which must first be mined from bauxite ore and then refined using the bayer process recycling scrap aluminium requires only 5 of the energy used to make new aluminium from the raw ore for this reason approximately 36 of all aluminium produced in the united states comes from old recycled scrap used beverage containers are the largest component of processed aluminum scrap and most of it is manufactured back into aluminium cans a common practice since the early 1900s and extensively capitalized during world war ii aluminium recycling is not new it was however a low profile activity until the late 1960s when the exploding popularity of aluminium beverage cans finally placed recycling into the public consciousness sources for recycled aluminium include aircraft automobiles bicycles boats computers cookware gutters siding wire and many other products that need a strong lightweight material or a material with high thermal conductivity as recycling does not transmute the element aluminium can be recycled indefinitely and still be used to produce any product for which new aluminium could have

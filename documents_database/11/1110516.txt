he has taught at the university of ferrara since 1996 a population geneticist by training barbujani has been working on several aspects of human genetic variation in collaboration with robert r sokal he pioneered the statistical comparison of patterns of genetic and linguistic variation showing that language differences may contribute to reproductive isolation and hence promote genetic divergence between populations his analyses of geographic patterns of genetic variation in europe support luca cavalli sforza s neolithic demic diffusion model or the idea that farming spread in the neolithic mainly because farmers did and not by cultural transmission there are two implications of this finding first that most europeans ancestors up to neolithic times did not live in geographical europe but rather in the near east and second that the early farmers expanding west carried with them their genes their technologies and possibly their languages his studies of the amount of dna differentiation among human populations and of its spatial distribution led to the conclusion that traditional human racial classifications fail to account for most of the existing patterns of genetic variation rather it seems that genetic variation is largely uncorrelated across genes which if confirmed would explain why no consensus

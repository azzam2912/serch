the term nano is used to indicate that the pixel sizes of the cross sections are in the nanometer range nano ct beamlines have been built at 3rd generation synchrotron radiation facilities including the advanced photon source of argonne national laboratory spring 8 and esrf from early 2000s they have been applied to wide variety of three dimensional visualization studies such as those of comet samples returned by the startdust mission mechanical degradation in lithium ion batteries and neuron deformation in schizophrenic brains although a lot of research is done to create nano ct scanners currently there are only a few available commercially the skyscan 2011 has a range of about 150 to 250 nanometers per pixel with a resolution of 400 nm and a field of view fov of 200 micrometers the xradia nanoxct has a spatial resolution of better than 50 nm and a fov of 16 micrometers at the ghent university the ugct team developed a nano ct scanner based on commercially available components the ugct facility is an open nano ct facility giving access to scientists from universities institutes and industry more information can be found at ugct website

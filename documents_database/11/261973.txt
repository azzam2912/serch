they are best observed during civil twilight when the sun is between 1 and 6 degrees below the horizon as well as in winter and in more northerly latitudes one main type of psc is made up mostly of supercooled droplets of water and nitric acid and is implicated in the formation of ozone holes the other main type consists only of frozen ice crystals and is not considered harmful this type of psc is also referred to as nacreous from nacre or mother of pearl due to its iridescence the stratosphere is very dry unlike the troposphere it rarely allows clouds to form in the extreme cold of the polar winter however stratospheric clouds of different types may form which are classified according to their physical state and chemical composition due to their high altitude and the curvature of the surface of the earth these clouds will receive sunlight from below the horizon and reflect it to the ground shining brightly well before dawn or after dusk pscs form at very low temperatures below these temperatures can occur in the lower stratosphere in polar winter in the antarctic temperatures below frequently cause type ii pscs such low temperatures are

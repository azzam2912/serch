when referring to the free surface effect the condition of a tank that is not full is described as a slack tank while a full tank is pressed up in a normally loaded vessel any rolling from perpendicular is countered by a righting moment generated from the increased volume of water displaced by the hull on the lowered side this assumes the center of gravity of the vessel is relatively constant if a moving mass inside the vessel moves in the direction of the roll this counters the righting effect by moving the center of gravity towards the lowered side the free surface effect can become a problem in a craft with large partially full bulk cargo compartments fuel tanks or water tanks especially if they span the full breadth of the ship or from accidental flooding such as has occurred in several accidents involving roll on roll off ferries if a compartment or tank is either empty or full there is no change in the craft s center of mass as it rolls from side to side in strong winds heavy seas or on sharp motions or turns however if the compartment is only partially full the liquid in

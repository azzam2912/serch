it was discovered in 2012 and reported independently by several research groups it has been identified mostly in stool samples from children and has been detected in a variety of geographic locations mwpyv was discovered in 2012 and independently reported by three different research groups under the names malawi polyomavirus mexico polyomavirus and human polyomavirus 10 the first group to publish gave the virus the malawi designation based on the geographic location of the index case a healthy child from malawi the designation mw polyomavirus has been included in the international committee on taxonomy of viruses proposed classification of polyomaviruses it was the 10th human polyomavirus to be discovered the organization of the mwpyv genome is typical of polyomaviruses at around 4 9 kilobase pairs in length it contains genes for the small tumor antigen and large tumor antigen and three viral coat proteins vp1 vp2 and vp3 different mwpyv isolates have a relatively large amount of sequence variation up to approximately 5 this pattern is similar to that seen in bk polyomavirus phylogenetic analyses of the mwpyv genome suggest different ancestries for the large tumor antigen and the major capsid protein vp1 implying that the virus might have evolved

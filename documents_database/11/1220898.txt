the electrodes are electrically insulated from each other by the pem these two electrodes make up the anode and cathode respectively the pem is a fluoropolymer pfsa proton permeable but electrical insulator barrier this barrier allows the transport of the protons from the anode to the cathode through the membrane but forces the electrons to travel around a conductive path to the cathode the most commonly used nafion pems are nafion xl 112 115 117 and 1110 the electrodes are heat pressed onto the pem commonly used materials for these electrodes are carbon cloth or carbon fiber papers nuvant produces a carbon cloth called elat which maximizes gas transport to the pem as well as moves water vapor away from the pem imbedding elat with noble metal catalyst allows this carbon cloth to also act as the electrode many other different methods and procedures also exist for the production of meas which are quite similar between fuel cells and electrolyzers platinum is one of the most commonly used catalysts however other platinum group metals are also used ruthenium and platinum are often used together if carbon monoxide co is a product of the electro chemical reaction as co poisons the

occurrences of events are neither uniform nor random in distribution there are spatial environment factors infrastructure sociocultural topographic etc that constrain and influence where the locations of events occur geospatial predictive modeling attempts to describe those constraints and influences by spatially correlating occurrences of historical geospatial locations with environmental factors that represent those constraints and influences geospatial predictive modeling is a process for analyzing events through a geographic filter in order to make statements of likelihood for event occurrence or emergence there are two broad types of geospatial predictive models deductive and inductive the deductive method relies on qualitative data or a subject matter expert sme to describe the relationship between event occurrences and factors that describe the environment as a result the deductive process generally will rely on more subjective information this means that the modeler could potentially be limiting the model by only inputting a number of factors that the human brain can comprehend an example of a deductive model is as follows sets of events are typically found in this deductive model high suitability locations for the set of events are constrained and influenced by non empirically calculated spatial ranges for airports land cover and elevation lower

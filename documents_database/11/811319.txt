since it was the only semiregular 5 polytope made of more than one type of regular facets he called it a 5 ic semi regular e l elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope labeling it as hm for a 5 dimensional half measure polytope coxeter named this polytope as 1 from its coxeter diagram which has branches of length 2 1 and 1 with a ringed node on one of the short branches and schl fli symbol formula 1 or 3 3 it exists in the k polytope family as 1 with the gosset polytopes 2 3 and 4 the graph formed by the vertices and edges of the demipenteract is sometimes called the clebsch graph though that name sometimes refers to the folded cube graph of order five instead cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a demipenteract centered at the origin and edge length 2 are alternate halves of the penteract with an odd number of plus signs this configuration matrix represents the 5 demicube the rows and columns correspond to vertices edges faces cells and 4 faces the diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 5 demicube the nondiagonal numbers

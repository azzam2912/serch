it is approximately 190 million light years from earth and has a diameter of about 165 000 light years ngc 128 was discovered by astronomer william herschel on 25 december 1790 using a reflecting telescope with an aperture of 18 7 inches at the time of discovery its coordinates were recorded as 00h 22m 05s 87 54 6 20 0 it was later observed by john herschel on 12 october 1827 the galaxy is described as pretty bright very small with a brighter middle it is approximately 165 000 light years in diameter and is elongated the galaxy is famous for its peanut shell shaped bulge and in 2016 it was discovered that there are two such nested structures possibly associated with two stellar bars ngc 128 is the largest member and the namesake of the ngc 128 group which also includes the galaxies ngc 127 and ngc 130 ngc 128 has a strong tidal bridge with ngc 127 and there is evidence of interaction between all three galaxies in the group ngc 128 has a noticeable peanut shape that is likely to be caused by gravitational effects of the other two galaxies

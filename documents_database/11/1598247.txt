this contrasts with the rational numbers whose corresponding number line has a gap at each irrational value in the decimal number system completeness is equivalent to the statement that any infinite string of decimal digits is actually a decimal representation for some real number depending on the construction of the real numbers used completeness may take the form of an axiom the completeness axiom or may be a theorem proven from the construction there are many equivalent forms of completeness the most prominent being dedekind completeness and cauchy completeness completeness as a metric space the real numbers can be defined synthetically as an ordered field satisfying some version of the completeness axiom different versions of this axiom are all equivalent in the sense that any ordered field that satisfies one form of completeness satisfies all of them apart from cauchy completeness and nested intervals theorem which are strictly weaker in that there are non archimedean fields that are ordered and cauchy complete when the real numbers are instead constructed using a model completeness becomes a theorem or collection of theorems the least upper bound property states that every nonempty set of real numbers having an upper bound must have a

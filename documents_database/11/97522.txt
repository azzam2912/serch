oleum is identified by the cas number 8014 95 7 ec list number 616 954 1 echa infocard 100 116 872 oleums cans be described by the formula y so ho where y is the total molar mass of sulfur trioxide contention pad the value of y can be varied to include different oleums they can also be described by the formula hso x so where x is now defined as the molar free sulfur trioxide content oleum is generally assessed according to the free so content by mass it can also be expressed as a percentage of sulfuric acid strength for oleum concentrations that would be over 100 for example 10 oleum can also be expressed as hso 0 13611 so 1 0225 so ho or 102 25 sulfuric acid the conversion between acid and oleum is acid 100 18 80 oleum a value for x of 1 gives the empirical formula hso for disulfuric pyrosulfuric acid pure disulfuric acid is a solid at room temperature melting at 36 c and rarely used either in the laboratory or industrial processes oleum is produced in the contact process where sulfur is oxidized to sulfur trioxide which is subsequently dissolved in

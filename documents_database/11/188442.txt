the converse is always true every hilbert space has this property there are however banach spaces which do not per enflo published the first counterexample in a 1973 article however a lot of work in this area was done by grothendieck 1955 later many other counterexamples were found the space of bounded operators on formula 1 does not have the approximation property szankowski the spaces formula 2 for formula 3 and formula 4 see sequence space have closed subspaces that do not have the approximation property a locally convex topological vector space formula 5 is said to have the approximation property if the identity map can be approximated uniformly on precompact sets by continuous linear maps of finite rank if x is a banach space this requirement becomes that for every compact set formula 6 and every formula 7 there is an operator formula 8 of finite rank so that formula 9 for every formula 10 some other flavours of the ap are studied let formula 5 be a banach space and let formula 12 we say that x has the formula 13 approximation property formula 13 ap if for every compact set formula 6 and every formula 7 there

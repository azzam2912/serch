this article defines some of these basic terms a string is a finite sequence of characters the empty string is denoted by formula 1 the concatenation of two string formula 2 and formula 3 is denoted by formula 4 or shorter by formula 5 concatenating with the empty string makes no difference formula 6 concatenation of strings is associative formula 7 for example formula 8 a language is a finite or infinite set of strings besides the usual set operations like union intersection etc concatenation can be applied to languages if both formula 9 and formula 10 are languages their concatenation formula 11 is defined as the set of concatenations of any string from formula 9 and any string from formula 10 formally formula 14 again the concatenation dot formula 15 is often omitted for brevity the language formula 16 consisting of just the empty string is to be distinguished from the empty language formula 17 concatenating any language with the former doesn t make any change formula 18 while concatenating with the latter always yields the empty language formula 19 concatenation of languages is associative formula 20 for example abbreviating formula 21 the set of all three digit decimal

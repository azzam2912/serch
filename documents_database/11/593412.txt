members of thermotoga are hyperthermophilic bacteria whose cell is wrapped in a unique sheath like outer membrane called a toga the members of the phylum stain gram negative as they possess a thin peptidoglycan in between two lipid bilayers albeit both peculiar the peptidoglycan is unusual as the crosslink is not only meso diaminopimelate as occurs in proteobacteria but d lysine the species are anaerobes with varying degrees of oxygen tolerance they are capable of reducing elemental sulphur s to hydrogen sulphide which in turn can be used whether thermophily is an innovation of the lineage or an ancestral trait is unclear and cannot be determined the genome of thermotoga maritima was sequenced in 1999 revealing several genes of archaeal origin possibly allowing its thermophilic adaptation the cg cytosine guanine content of t maritima is 46 2 most thermophiles in fact have high cg content this has led to the speculation that cg content may be a non essential consequence to thermophily and not the driver towards thermophily the type species of the genus is t maritima first described in 1986 at the time it was the first species of the phylum to be described the genus thermotoga now contains

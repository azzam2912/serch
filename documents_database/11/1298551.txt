the allowed vertices have an even number of arrows pointing towards the vertex these include the six inherited from the ice type model 1 6 and sinks and sources 7 8 we consider a formula 1 lattice with formula 2 vertices and formula 3 edges imposing periodic boundary conditions requires that the states 7 and 8 occur equally often as do states 5 and 6 and thus can be taken to have the same energy for the zero field case the same is true for the two other pairs of states each vertex formula 4 has an associated energy formula 5 and boltzmann weight formula 6 giving the partition function over the lattice as where the summation is over all allowed configurations of vertices in the lattice in this general form the partition function remains unsolved the zero field case of the model corresponds physically to the absence of external electric fields hence the model remains unchanged under the reversal of all arrows the states 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 consequently must occur as pairs the vertices can be assigned arbitrary weights the solution is based on the observation that rows in transfer matrices commute for a certain

the first one was formally published in 1997 jenkins s one at a time hash is adapted here from a www page by bob jenkins which is an expanded version of his dr dobb s article it was originally created to fulfill certain requirements described by colin plumb a cryptographer but was ultimately not put to use sample hash values for one at a time hash function the avalanche behavior of this hash is shown on the right each of the 24 rows corresponds to a single bit in the 3 byte input key and each of the 32 columns corresponds to a bit in the output hash colors are chosen by how well the input key bit affects the given output hash bit a green square indicates good mixing behavior a yellow square weak mixing behavior and red would indicate no mixing only a few bits in the last byte of the input key are weakly mixed to a minority of bits in the output hash the standard implementation of the perl programming language includes jenkins s one at a time hash or a hardened variant of it along with siphash and uses jenkins s one at a time

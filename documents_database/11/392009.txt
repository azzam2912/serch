it accounts for magnetic interactions and retardation effects to the order of 1 c when other quantum electrodynamic effects are negligible this equation has been shown to give results in good agreement with experiment it was originally derived from the darwin lagrangian but later vindicated by the wheeler feynman absorber theory and eventually quantum electrodynamics the breit equation is not only an approximation in terms of quantum mechanics but also in terms of relativity theory as it is not completely invariant with respect to the lorentz transformation just as does the dirac equation it treats nuclei as point sources of an external field for the particles it describes for n particles the breit equation has the form r is the distance between particle i and j where is the dirac hamiltonian see dirac equation for particle i at position r and r is the scalar potential at that position q is the charge of the particle thus for electrons q e the one electron dirac hamiltonians of the particles along with their instantaneous coulomb interactions 1 r form the dirac coulomb operator to this breit added the operator now known as the frequency independent breit operator where the dirac matrices

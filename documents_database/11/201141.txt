theoretically the highest energy photon carries precisely 1 of energy see ultra high energy gamma ray most planck units are extremely small or extremely large as in the case of planck temperature and planck acceleration for comparison the planck energy is approximately equal to the energy stored in an automobile gas tank 57 2 l of gasoline at 34 2 mj l of chemical energy planck units are designed to normalize the physical constants and to 1 hence given planck units the mass energy equivalence simplifies to so that the planck energy and mass are numerically identical in the equations of general relativity is often multiplied by 4 hence writings in particle physics and physical cosmology often normalize to 1 this normalization results in the reduced planck energy defined as

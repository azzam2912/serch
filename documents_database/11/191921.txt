it is also known as the research hypothesis because it is constructed from literature review previous studies etc in statistics alternative hypothesis is often denoted as h or h hypotheses are formulated to compare in a statistical hypothesis test in the domain of inferential statistics two rival hypotheses can be compared by explanatory power and predictive power an example is where water quality in a stream has been observed over many years and a test is made of the null hypothesis that there is no change in quality between the first and second halves of the data against the alternative hypothesis that the quality is poorer in the second half of the record the concept of an alternative hypothesis in testing was devised by jerzy neyman and egon pearson and it is used in the neyman pearson lemma it forms a major component in modern statistical hypothesis testing however it was not part of ronald fisher s formulation of statistical hypothesis testing and he opposed its use in fisher s approach to testing the central idea is to assess whether the observed dataset could have resulted from chance if the null hypothesis were assumed to hold notionally without preconceptions about

the scientific literature has never or possibly only obscurely reported observations of live individuals the taxonomic classification of the species has been subject to recent revision previous common names for this species included flightless scaly tail squirrel but this is a misnomer as anomalures are very distantly related to the true squirrels of the rodent family sciuridae and only superficially resemble them z insignis is the only extant species in the genus zenkerella and family zenkerellidae and is the only surviving species of a lineage that diverged from the other extant anomalures genera idiurus and anomalurus 49 million years ago ma among mammals very few species are the sole survivors of such ancient lineages some other examples being the pen tailed treeshrew and the monito del monte extinct fossil taxa which are putative close relatives of z insignis include zenkerella wintoni 20 ma early miocene kenya prozenkerella saharaensis 31 ma early oligocene libya and possibly oromys zenkerellinopsis 33 ma earliest oligocene morocco in 2016 it was reported that three whole body specimens of z insignis were recovered on bioko island equatorial guinea at that time it had been over 20 years since the scientific literature recorded new individuals these specimens

the system also goes by the name x ray nova muscae 1991 or gu muscae these two orbiting x ray telescopes discovered the system when the system produced an outburst of x rays on january 9 1991 it is one of several likely black hole systems that are classified as x ray novae such a nova periodically produces bright outbursts of x rays along with visible light and other forms of energy in such a system a black hole pulls gas from the surface of a companion star the gas forms a thin disk around the black hole known as an accretion disk in an x ray nova the flow of gas is fairly thin and slow so the accretion disk remains relatively cool and little gas falls into the black hole in the case of gu muscae the black hole is about seven times as massive as the sun while the companion is three quarters as massive as the sun the companion is also cooler than the sun so its surface is redder and the star s total luminosity is only one third that of the sun s its outer layers probably were blown away by the supernova explosion

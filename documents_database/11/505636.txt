this receptor is activated by the biogenic amine histamine it is expressed in smooth muscles on vascular endothelial cells in the heart and in the central nervous system the h receptor is linked to an intracellular g protein g that activates phospholipase c and the inositol triphosphate ip3 signalling pathway antihistamines which act on this receptor are used as anti allergy drugs the crystal structure of the receptor has been determined shown on the right and used to discover new histamine h receptor ligands in structure based virtual screening studies the expression of nf b the transcription factor that regulates inflammatory processes is promoted by the constitutive activity of the h receptor as well as by agonists that bind at the receptor h antihistamines have been shown to attenuate nf b expression and mitigate certain inflammatory processes in associated cells histamine h receptors are activated by endogenous histamine which is released by neurons that have their cell bodies in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus become active during the wake cycle firing at approximately 2 hz during slow wave sleep this firing rate drops to approximately 0 5 hz finally during rem sleep

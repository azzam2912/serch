the carry flag enables numbers larger than a single alu width to be added subtracted by carrying adding a binary digit from a partial addition subtraction to the least significant bit position of a more significant word it is also used to extend bit shifts and rotates in a similar manner on many processors sometimes done via a dedicated x flag for subtractive operations two opposite conventions are employed as most machines set the carry flag on borrow while some machines such as the 6502 and the pic instead reset the carry flag on borrow and vice versa the carry flag is affected by the result of most arithmetic and typically several bit wise instructions and is also used as an input to many of them several of these instructions have two forms which either read or ignore the carry in assembly languages these instructions are represented by mnemonics such as codice 1 codice 2 codice 1 including carry codice 4 bit shifts codice 5 bit rotates codice 6 rotate through carry and so on the use of the carry flag in this manner enables multi word add subtract shift and rotate operations an example is what happens if one

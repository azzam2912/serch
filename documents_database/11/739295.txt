the station converts the 500 kv direct current coming from the northern converter station celilo to alternating current at 60 hz and 230 kv synchronized with the los angeles power grid the station capacity is 3 100 megawatts originally mercury arc valves were used as static inverter valves the valves were series connected in three six pulse valve bridges for each pole the blocking voltage of the valves was 133 kv with a maximum current of 1 800 amperes for a transmission rate of 1 440 megawatts with a symmetrical voltage of 400 kv against earth after the sylmar earthquake in 1971 the static inverter station in sylmar was reconstructed due to damage sustained in 1982 the power rating of the mercury arc valve rectifiers was raised by various improvements to 1 600 megawatts in 1985 two six pulse valve groups of thyristors were added to increase the voltage to 500 kv per pole for a total differential voltage of 1 000 kv in 1989 the station was extended on the field east of the highway called sylmar east converter station where two new 1 100 ampere 500 kv 12 pulse thyristor converters were added in parallel with the two

other forms such as n glycolylneuraminic acid may also occur in cells this residue is negatively charged at physiological ph and is found in complex glycans on mucins and glycoproteins found at the cell membrane neu5ac residues are also found in glycolipids known as gangliosides a crucial component of neuronal membranes found in the brain along with involvement in preventing infections mucus associated with mucous membranes mouth nose gi respiratory tract neu5ac acts as a receptor for influenza viruses allowing attachment to mucous cells via hemagglutinin an early step in acquiring influenzavirus infection neu5ac is also important in the biology of a member of pathogenic bacteria as it can used either as a nutrient providing both carbon and nitrogen to the bacteria or in some pathogens can be activated and placed on the cell surface bacteria have evolved transporters for neu5ac to enable them to capture it from their environment and a number of these have been characterized including the nant protein from escherichia coli the siapqm trap transporter from haemophilus influenzae and the satabcd abc transporter from haemophilus ducreyi

it is often used as a tracer dye in water to determine the rate and direction of flow and transport rhodamine dyes fluoresce and can thus be detected easily and inexpensively with fluorometers rhodamine dyes are used extensively in biotechnology applications such as fluorescence microscopy flow cytometry fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and elisa rhodamine b is used in biology as a staining fluorescent dye sometimes in combination with auramine o as the auramine rhodamine stain to demonstrate acid fast organisms notably mycobacterium rhodamine b is tunable around 610 nm when used as a laser dye its luminescence quantum yield is 0 65 in basic ethanol 0 49 in ethanol 1 0 and 0 68 in 94 ethanol the fluorescence yield is temperature dependent the solubility of rhodamine b in water is 15 g l however the solubility in acetic acid solution 30 vol is 400 g l however the solubility of rhodamine b in water is reported as 0 8 g 100 ml and 1 5 g 100 ml in ethanol which is more consistent with solubility in water and ethanol chlorinated tap water decomposes rhodamine b rhodamine b solutions adsorb to plastics and should be kept in glass rhodamine b

vertices of the rectified 5 simplex are located at the edge centers of the 5 simplex vertices of the birectified 5 simplex are located in the triangular face centers of the 5 simplex in five dimensional geometry a rectified 5 simplex is a uniform 5 polytope with 15 vertices 60 edges 80 triangular faces 45 cells 15 tetrahedral and 30 octahedral and 12 4 faces 6 5 cell and 6 rectified 5 cells it is also called 0 for its branching coxeter dynkin diagram shown as e l elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope labeling it as s the vertices of the rectified 5 simplex can be more simply positioned on a hyperplane in 6 space as permutations of 0 0 0 0 1 1 or 0 0 1 1 1 1 these construction can be seen as facets of the rectified 6 orthoplex or birectified 6 cube respectively this configuration matrix represents the rectified 5 simplex the rows and columns correspond to vertices edges faces cells and 4 faces the diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole rectified 5 simplex the nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column s element

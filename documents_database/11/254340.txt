meyer claimed that an automobile retrofitted with the device could use water as fuel instead of gasoline meyer s claims about his water fuel cell and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an ohio court in 1996 the water fuel cell purportedly split water into its component elements hydrogen and oxygen the hydrogen gas was then burned to generate energy a process that reconstituted the water molecules according to meyer the device required less energy to perform electrolysis than the minimum energy requirement predicted or measured by conventional science the mechanism of action was alleged to involve brown s gas a mixture of oxyhydrogen with a ratio of 2 1 the same composition as liquid water which would then be mixed with ambient air nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide carbon monoxide methane chlorofluorocarbons free radicals electrons radiation among others if the device worked as specified it would violate both the first and second laws of thermodynamics allowing operation as a perpetual motion machine throughout his patents meyer used the terms fuel cell or water fuel cell to refer to the portion of his device in which electricity is passed through water to produce hydrogen and oxygen

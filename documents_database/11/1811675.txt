the treatment regimen that achieves the goal of preserving function with the lowest risk fewest adverse effects and least disruption of the patient s life taking into account the cost implications of treatment should be the approach taken the more advanced the glaucomatous process on initial presentation the lower the target range generally needs to be to prevent further progression this more aggressive target is meant to minimize the risk of progressive glaucoma damage and vision loss once the optic nerve is damaged it is more likely to incur more damage and if severe visual loss is present there is greater impact on the patient from any additional damage that may occur an initial reduction in the intraocular pressure of 20 from baseline is suggested however reduction of iop to the target pressure range does not guarantee that progression will not occur therefore the target pressure range needs to be constantly reassessed and changed as dictated by iop fluctuations optic nerve changes and or visual field progression medications are divided into several groups based on chemical structure and pharmacologic action agents in common clinical use include when comparing people with primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension medical intraocular pressure

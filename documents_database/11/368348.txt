during the winter months the water in the ground freezes and expands once temperatures reach 17 degrees celsius or lower the ice that has already formed acts like a solid and expands to form cracks in the surface known as ice wedges as this process continues over many years ice wedges can grow up to the size of a swimming pool ice wedges usually appear in a polygonal pattern known as ice wedge polygons the cracks can also be filled with materials other than ice especially sand and then they re called sand wedges there are many theories that attempt to explain the origin of ice wedges but only one has been consistently supported by most prominent scientists the thermal contraction theory the thermal contraction theory posits that during the winter months thermal contraction cracks form only a few cm wide and a couple of metres deep because of the extreme cold weather over the next few months the snow melts and the remaining water fills the cracks and the permafrost below the surface freezes it these tiny cracks turn into permafrost once the summer months arrive the permafrost expands horizontal compression produces upturning of the frozen sediment by plastic

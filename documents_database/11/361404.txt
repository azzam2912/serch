a soliton is a localized field configuration that is stable it cannot spread out and dissipate in the case of a non topological soliton the stability is guaranteed by a conserved charge the soliton has lower energy per unit charge than any other configuration in physics charge is often represented by the letter q and the soliton is spherically symmetric hence the name a q ball arises in a theory of bosonic particles when there is an attraction between the particles loosely speaking the q ball is a finite sized blob containing a large number of particles the blob is stable against fission into smaller blobs and against evaporation via emission of individual particles because due to the attractive interaction the blob is the lowest energy configuration of that number of particles this is analogous to the fact that nickel 62 is the most stable nucleus because it is the most stable configuration of neutrons and protons however nickel 62 is not a q ball in part because neutrons and protons are fermions not bosons for there to be a q ball the number of particles must be conserved i e the particle number is a conserved charge so the

it forms a segment of the garibaldi volcanic belt the canadian portion of the cascade volcanic arc which extends from northern california to southwestern british columbia most of the cayley volcanoes were formed during periods of volcanism under sheets of glacial ice throughout the last glacial period these subglacial eruptions formed steep flat topped volcanoes and subglacial lava domes most of which have been entirely exposed by deglaciation however at least two volcanoes predate the last glacial period and both are highly eroded the field gets its name from mount cayley the largest and most persistent volcano located at the southern end of the powder mountain icefield this icefield covers much of the central portion of the volcanic field and is one of the several glacial fields in the pacific ranges of the coast mountains eruptions along the length of the field began between 1 6 and 5 3 million years ago at least 23 eruptions have occurred throughout its eruptive history this volcanic activity ranged from effusive to explosive with magma compositions ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic because the mount cayley volcanic field has a high elevation and consists of a cluster of mostly high altitude non overlapping volcanoes

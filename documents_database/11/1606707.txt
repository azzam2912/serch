it is a two dimensional carbon sheet of sp hybridized carbons with each carbon atom bound to one fluorine the chemical formula is cf in comparison teflon polytetrafluoroethylene cf consists of carbon chains with each carbon bound to two fluorines unlike fluorographene graphene is unsaturated sp hybridized and completely carbon the hydrocarbon analogue to fluorographene is sp hybridized graphane similar to other fluorocarbons e g perfluorohexane fluorographene is highly insulating fluorographene is thermally stable resembling polytetrafluoroethylene however chemically it is reactive it can be transformed back into graphene by reaction with ki under higher temperature during reactions of fluorographene with naoh and nash simultaneous reductive defluorination and substitution are observed the reactivity of fluorographene represents a facile way towards graphene derivatives the material was first described in 2010 by robinson et al using graphene grown on copper foil exposed to xenon difluoride at 30 c the group of nair et al started from cleaved graphene crystals on a gold grid also exposed to xenon difluoride at 70 c also in 2010 withers et al described exfoliation of fluorinated graphite monolayer 24 fluorination and cheng et al reported reversible graphene fluorination the stoichiometric fluorographene cf was also prepared by chemical exfoliation

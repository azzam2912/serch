operationally a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment the environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function variables that are used locally but defined in an enclosing scope with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created unlike a plain function a closure allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure s copies of their values or references even when the function is invoked outside their scope the concept of closures was developed in the 1960s for the mechanical evaluation of expressions in the calculus and was first fully implemented in 1970 as a language feature in the pal programming language to support lexically scoped first class functions peter j landin defined the term closure in 1964 as having an environment part and a control part as used by his secd machine for evaluating expressions joel moses credits landin with introducing the term closure to refer to a lambda expression whose open bindings free variables have been closed by or bound in the lexical environment resulting in a closed expression or closure this usage was subsequently adopted by sussman and steele when

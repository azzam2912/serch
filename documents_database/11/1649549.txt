regulondb also models the organization of the genes in transcription units operons and regulons a total of 120 srnas with 231 total interactions which all together regulate 192 genes are also included regulondb was founded in 1998 and also contributes data to the ecocyc database in bacteria such as e coli genes are regulated by sequence elements in promoters and related binding sites regulondb provides a database of such regulatory elements their binding sites and the transcription factors that bind to these sites in e coli regulondb 9 0 includes 184 experimentally determined transcription factors tfs as well as 120 computationally predicted tfs that is a total of 304 the complete repertoire of 189 genetic sensory response units gensor units are reported integrating their signal regulatory interactions and metabolic pathways a total of 78 gensor units have their four components highlighted 119 include the genetic switch and the response and 2 contain only the genetic switch a total of 103 tfs have a known effector in regulondb including 25 two component systems there were enough sites to build a motif for 93 tfs to infer 16 207 predicted tf binding sites this set of predicted binding sites corresponds to 12

in early days electricity was considered as being unrelated to magnetism later on many experimental results and the development of maxwell s equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon electromagnetism various common phenomena are related to electricity including lightning static electricity electric heating electric discharges and many others the presence of an electric charge which can be either positive or negative produces an electric field the movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field when a charge is placed in a location with a non zero electric field a force will act on it the magnitude of this force is given by coulomb s law thus if that charge were to move the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies being used for electrical phenomena have been studied since

released on february 17 2014 by metal blade records the album has received universal acclaim and has been praised for its creative use of traditional metal themes inspired by iron maiden and thin lizzy the album took approximately nine months to record although the recording itself occurred sporadically frontman mike scalzi suggested that the recording was not different from any other album except for his use of the organ with all of the songs written with the band in the rehearsal space just like our other albums however he admitted that the singing took forever because my voice is getting old and decrepit and was never really suited for metal in the first place i have a crooners voice or if i d worked at it a little maybe a choir voice but not a high pitched metal voice but i love metal so i try to sing like freddie mercury and fail and end up sounding like neil diamond on steroids what can i say the album cover features a statue of romulus and remus the mythological founders of rome suckling a she wolf set against a dystopian background as mike scalzi explained the cover places romulus and remus

it is used to make distant objects appear magnified with magnification increasing as longer focal length lenses are used a long focus lens is one of three basic photographic lens types classified by relative focal length the other two being a normal lens and a wide angle lens as with other types of camera lenses the focal length is usually expressed in a millimeter value written on the lens for example a 500 mm lens the most common type of long focus lens is the telephoto lens which incorporate a special lens group known as a telephoto group to make the physical length of the lens shorter than the focal length long focus lenses are best known for making distant objects appear magnified this effect is similar to moving closer to the object but is not the same since perspective is a function solely of viewing location two images taken from the same location one with a wide angle lens and the other with a long focus lens will show identical perspective in that near and far objects appear the same relative size to each other comparing magnification by using a long lens to magnification by moving closer however the

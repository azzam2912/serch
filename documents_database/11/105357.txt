movement is characterized by sliding along a concave upward or planar surface causes of slumping include earthquake shocks thorough wetting freezing and thawing undercutting and loading of a slope translational slumps occur when a detached landmass moves along a planar surface common planar surfaces of failure include joints or bedding planes especially where a permeable layer overrides an impermeable surface block slumps are a type of translational slump in which one or more related block units move downslope as a relatively coherent mass rotational slumps occur when a slump block composed of sediment or rock slides along a concave upward slip surface with rotation about an axis parallel to the slope rotational movement causes the original surface of the block to become less steep and the top of the slump is rotated backward this results in internal deformation of the moving mass consisting chiefly of overturned folds called sheath folds slumps have several characteristic features the cut which forms as the landmass breaks away from the slope is called the scarp and is often cliff like and concave in rotational slumps the main slump block often breaks into a series of secondary slumps and associated scarps to form stairstep pattern

the propellant can be divided into three groups of components the fuel the oxidizer and the additive s in the past sucrose was most commonly used as fuel modern formulations most commonly use sorbitol for its ease of production the most common oxidizer is potassium nitrate kno potassium nitrate is most commonly found in household stump remover additives can be many different substances and either act as catalysts or enhance the aesthetics of the liftoff or flight a traditional sugar propellant formulation is typically prepared in a 65 35 13 7 oxidizer to fuel ratio there are many different methods for preparation of a sugar based rocket propellant dry compression does not require heating only the grinding of the components and then packing into the motor however this method is not recommended for serious experimenting dry heating does not actually melt the kno but it melts the sugar and then the kno grains become suspended in the sugar the specific impulse total impulse and thrust are generally lower for the same amount of fuel than other composite model rocket fuels but rocket candy is significantly cheaper in the united states rocket candy motors are legal to make but illegal to

the detergent is rendered inactive by cleavage usually under acidic conditions in order to make the sample compatible with a following procedure or in order to selectively remove the cleavage products applications for cleavable detergents include protease digestion of proteins such as in gel digestion with trypsin after sds page and peptide extractions from electrophoresis gels cleavable detergents are mainly used in sample preparations for mass spectrometry pps available as pps silent surfactant from expedeon is the abbreviation for sodium 3 4 1 1 bis hexyloxy ethyl pyridinium 1 yl propane 1 sulfonate this acetalic detergent is split under acidic conditions into hexanol and the zwitterionic 3 acetyl 1 3 sulfopropyl pyridinium proteasemax is the brandname of promega for sodium 3 1 furan 2 yl undecyloxy carbonylamino propane 1 sulfonate this cleavable detergent is sensitive to heat and acid and is degraded during a typical trypsin digestion into the uncharged lipophilic compound 1 furan 2 yl undecan 1 ol and the zwitterionic 3 aminopropane 1 sulfonic acid homotaurine which can be removed by c18 solid phase extraction during sample work up rapigest sf the brand name for sodium 3 2 methyl 2 undecyl 1 3 dioxolan 4 yl methoxy 1

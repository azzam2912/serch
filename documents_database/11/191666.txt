the gill filaments develop on only one side of the central axis the shell has a well developed siphonal canal the elongated trunk like siphon is an extensible tube formed from a fold in the mantle it is used to suck water into the mantle cavity at the base of the siphon is the bipectinate branching from a central axis osphradium a sensory receptacle and olfactory organ that is more developed than the one in the mesogastropoda they achieved important morphological changes including e g the elongation of the siphonal canal a shift in the mouth opening to a terminal position on the head and the formation of a well developed proboscis the nervous system is very concentrated many species have the ganglia in a compact space the rachiglossate rasp like radula a layer of serially arranged teeth within the mouth has only three denticles small teeth in each transverse row the neogastropoda have separate sexes there are about 16 000 species neogastropoda includes many well known gastropods including the cone snails conchs mud snails olive snails oyster drills tulip shells and whelks the neogastropoda all live in the sea except clea and rivomarginella that are freshwater genera the neogastropods

the circuit was invented in 1915 by american engineer ralph hartley the distinguishing feature of the hartley oscillator is that the tuned circuit consists of a single capacitor in parallel with two inductors in series or a single tapped inductor and the feedback signal needed for oscillation is taken from the center connection of the two inductors the hartley oscillator was invented by hartley while he was working for the research laboratory of the western electric company hartley invented and patented the design in 1915 while overseeing bell system s transatlantic radiotelephone tests it was awarded patent number 1 356 763 on october 26 1920 note that the basic schematic shown below labeled common drain hartley circuit is essentially the same as in the patent drawing except that the tube is replaced by a j fet and that the battery for a negative grid bias is not needed in 1946 hartley was awarded the ire medal of honor for his early work on oscillating circuits employing triode tubes and likewise for his early recognition and clear exposition of the fundamental relationship between the total amount of information which may be transmitted over a transmission system of limited band width and

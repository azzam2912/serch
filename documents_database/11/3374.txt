if proteins in a living cell are denatured this results in disruption of cell activity and possibly cell death protein denaturation is also a consequence of cell death denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics from conformational change and loss of solubility to aggregation due to the exposure of hydrophobic groups denatured proteins lose their 3d structure and therefore cannot function protein folding is key to whether a globular or membrane protein can do its job correctly it must be folded into the right shape to function however hydrogen bonds which play a big part in folding are rather weak and thus easily affected by heat acidity varying salt concentrations and other stressors which can denature the protein this is one reason why tight homeostasis is physiologically necessary in many life forms this concept is unrelated to denatured alcohol which is alcohol that has been mixed with additives to make it unsuitable for human consumption when food is cooked some of its proteins become denatured this is why boiled eggs become hard and cooked meat becomes firm a classic example of denaturing in proteins comes from egg whites which are typically largely egg albumins in water fresh from

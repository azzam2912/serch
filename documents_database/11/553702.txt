in the first step two molecules of o are added as two peroxide linkages and a 5 member carbon ring is forged near the middle of the fatty acid chain this forms the short lived unstable intermediate prostaglandin g pgg one of the peroxide linkages sheds a single oxygen forming pgh see diagrams and more detail at cyclooxygenase all other prostanoids originate from pgh as pgh pgh or pgh the image at right shows how pgh derived from arachidonic acid is converted the three classes of prostanoids have distinctive rings in the center of the molecule they differ in their structures the pgh compounds parents to all the rest have a 5 carbon ring bridged by two oxygens a peroxide the derived prostaglandins contain a single unsaturated 5 carbon ring in prostacyclins this ring is conjoined to another oxygen containing ring in thromboxanes the ring becomes a 6 member ring with one oxygen production of pge in bacterial and viral infections appear to be stimulated by certain cytokines e g interleukin 1

magnetometers are among the most widely used scientific instruments in exploratory and observation satellites these instruments were instrumental in mapping the van allen radiation belts around earth after its discovery by explorer 1 and have detailed the magnetic fields of the earth moon sun mars venus and other planets and moons there are ongoing missions using magnetometers including attempts to define the shape and activity of saturn s core the first spacecraft borne magnetometer was placed on the sputnik 3 spacecraft in 1958 and the most detailed magnetic observations of the earth have been performed by the magsat and rsted satellites magnetometers were taken to the moon during the later apollo missions many instruments have been used to measure the strength and direction of magnetic field lines around earth and the solar system spacecraft magnetometers basically fall into three categories fluxgate search coil and ionized gas magnetometers the most accurate magnetometer complexes on spacecraft contain two separate instruments with a helium ionized gas magnetometer used to calibrate the fluxgate instrument for more accurate readings many later magnetometers contain small ring coils oriented at 90 in two dimensions relative to each other forming a triaxial framework for indicating direction of magnetic

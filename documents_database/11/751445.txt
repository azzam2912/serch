the mine is square with an olive drab body constructed from polythene with a webbing carrying handle on the side and an ammonia free bakelite seating for the pressure plate to be screwed into the fuze well is in the centre of the seating with the pressure plate screwed into it after the fuze has been inserted the cylindrical pressure plate consists of two plastic plates one of which moves under the weight of a vehicle driving over the mine to transmit the force to the fuze shearing pins which hold it in place the prb m3a1 variant has two secondary fuze wells and is often deployed with a m30 anti lift device the m30 fuze detonates the mine if it is lifted more than 3 cm it is also a minimum metal mine with the only metal components being two spring steel wire strikers and two aluminium percussion caps both versions of the mine are waterproof when new and can be laid in shallow water but the mine casing often splits and warps in hot climates although small splits do not affect the mine s performance the mines are prone to sympathetic detonation if laid closer together than 2

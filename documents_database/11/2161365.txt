the eif4f complex is composed of three non identical subunits the dead box rna helicase eif4a the cap binding protein eif4e and the large scaffold protein eif4g the mammalian eif4f complex was first described in 1983 and has been a major area of study into the molecular mechanisms of cap dependent translation initiation ever since eif4f is important for recruiting the small ribosomal subunit 40s to the 5 cap of mrnas during cap dependent translation initiation components of the complex are also involved in cap independent translation initiation for instance certain viral proteases cleave eif4g to remove the eif4e binding region thus inhibiting cap dependent translation structures of eif4f components have been solved individually and as partial complexes by a variety of methods but no complete structure of eif4f is currently available in mammals the eif4e g a trimeric complex can be directly purified from cells while only the two subunit eif4e g can be purified from yeast cells eif4e binds the mg 5 cap and the eif4g scaffold connecting the mrna 5 terminus to a hub of other initiation factors and mrna the interaction of eif4g a is thought to guide the formation of a single stranded rna landing

the impact of glaciers on people includes the fields of human geography and anthropology the discoveries of water ice on the moon mars europa and pluto add an extraterrestrial component to the field which is referred to as astroglaciology a glacier is an extended mass of ice formed from snow falling and accumulating over a long period of time glaciers move very slowly either descending from high mountains as in valley glaciers or moving outward from centers of accumulation as in continental glaciers areas of study within glaciology include glacial history and the reconstruction of past glaciation a glaciologist is a person who studies glaciers a glacial geologist studies glacial deposits and glacial erosive features on the landscape glaciology and glacial geology are key areas of polar research glaciers can be identified by their geometry and the relationship to the surrounding topography there are two general categories of glaciation which glaciologists distinguish alpine glaciation accumulations or rivers of ice confined to valleys and continental glaciation unrestricted accumulations which once covered much of the northern continents when a glacier is experiencing an input of precipitation that exceeds the output the glacier is advancing conversely if the output from evaporation sublimation melting

it was proposed separately in three papers the first by james wells in june 2003 in a more modest form that mildly relaxed the assumption about naturalness in the higgs potential in may 2004 nima arkani hamed and savas dimopoulos argued that naturalness in the higgs sector may not be an accurate guide to propose new physics beyond the standard model and argued that supersymmetry may be realized in a different fashion that preserved gauge coupling unification and has a dark matter candidate in june 2004 gian giudice and andrea romanino argued from a general point of view that if one wants gauge coupling unification and a dark matter candidate that split supersymmetry is one amongst a few theories that exists the new light tev particles in split supersymmetry beyond the standard models particles are the lagrangian for split supersymmetry is constrained from the existence of high energy supersymmetry there are five couplings in split supersymmetry the higgs quartic coupling and four yukawa couplings between the higgsinos higgs and gauginos the couplings are set by one parameter formula 1 at the scale where the supersymmetric scalars decouple beneath the supersymmetry breaking scale these five couplings evolve through the renormalization group

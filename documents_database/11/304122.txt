there is a transition region between semi infinite penetration and perforation in which the target is not perforated but the projectile as it nears the back face of the target meets reduced resistance and is capable of penetrating a greater distance than it would in a semi infinite target this effect is variously named the back or rear surface plate or face effect and is also present when perforation occurs a penetrating projectile may cause the target to break into multiple pieces spewing from both the front and back of the target themselves at high velocity these pieces are collectively referred to as spall spall can be generated even if a perforation is not achieved the projectile fails to pass through the target generated instead by the shock wave generated by the impact of the projectile bombs designed for great penetration into the earth or for perforation of hardened targets are known as bunker busters

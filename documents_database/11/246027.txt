the safety buffer allows for errors in the air by including an additional area that a pilot might stray into by flying off track by flying at or above this altitude a pilot complies with terrain clearance requirements on that particular flight leg for example if there is an obstacle at 200 feet above terrain of 2500 feet lsalt is 2500 feet terrain height 1360 feet clearance height for an lsalt of 3860 feet if there is an obstacle at 450 feet above terrain of 3600 feet lsalt is 4050 feet obstacle height 1000 feet clearance height or an lsalt of 5050 feet the differences in the clearance heights for obstacles is due to the potential for unreported obstacles up to 360 feet which are not marked on maps or charts the determination of which is the highest obstacle along the flight path depends on the method of navigation radio navigation aid dead reckoning or area navigation systems and on the flight rules instrument or night vfr in the united states in particular the federal aviation administration calls this concept the minimum safe altitude msa and is defined within the federal aviation regulations far there are two restrictions on altitude

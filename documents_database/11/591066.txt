in actuality 132x128 pes were configured with a 4x128 configuration added for fault tolerance to substitute for up to 4 rows or columns of processors in the presence of problems the pes operated in a single instruction multiple data simd fashioneach pe performed the same operation simultaneously on different data elements under the control of a microprogrammed control unit after the mpp was retired in 1991 it was donated to the smithsonian institution and is now in the collection of the national air and space museum s steven f udvar hazy center it was succeeded at goddard by the maspar mp 1 and cray t3d massively parallel computers the mpp was initially developed for high speed analysis of satellite images in early tests it was able to extract and separate different land use areas on landsat imagery in 18 seconds as compared with 7 hours on a dec vax 11 780 once the system was put into production use nasa s office of space science and applications solicited proposals from scientists across the country to test and implement a wide range of computational algorithms on the mpp 40 projects were accepted to form the mpp working group results of most

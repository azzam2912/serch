the diffraction limit is a feature of conventional lenses and microscopes that limits the fineness of their resolution many lens designs have been proposed that go beyond the diffraction limit in some way but constraints and obstacles face each of them in 1873 ernst abbe reported that conventional lenses are incapable of capturing some fine details of any given image the super lens is intended to capture such details the limitation of conventional lenses has inhibited progress in the biological sciences this is because a virus or dna molecule cannot be resolved with the highest powered conventional microscopes this limitation extends to the minute processes of cellular proteins moving alongside microtubules of a living cell in their natural environments additionally computer chips and the interrelated microelectronics are manufactured to smaller and smaller scales this requires specialized optical equipment which is also limited because these use the conventional lens hence the principles governing a super lens show that it has potential for imaging a dna molecule and cellular protein processes or aiding in the manufacture of even smaller computer chips and microelectronics furthermore conventional lenses capture only the propagating light waves these are waves that travel from a light source or

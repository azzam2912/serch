from the study of this spectrum the concentration of optically active components of the upper layer of the water body can be concluded via specific algorithms water quality monitoring by remote sensing and close range instruments has obtained considerable attention since the founding of eu water framework directive if water remote sensing is defined as the observation of the water from a distance in order to describe its color state of health saturation levels and more without taking water samples the gradual development of understanding of the transparency of natural waters and of the reason of their clarity variability and coloration has been sketched from the times of henry hudson 1600 to those of chandrasekhara raman 1930 however the development of water remote sensing techniques by the use of satellite imaging aircraft or close range optical devices didn t start until the early 1970s these first techniques measured the spectral and thermal differences in the emitted energy from water surfaces in general empirical relationships were settled between the spectral properties and the water quality parameters of the water body in 1974 ritchie et al 1974 developed an empirical approach to determine suspended sediments this kind of empirical models are only

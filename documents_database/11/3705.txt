as such it generalizes a circle which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same the elongation of an ellipse is measured by its eccentricity e a number ranging from e 0 the limiting case of a circle to e 1 the limiting case of infinite elongation no longer an ellipse but a parabola analytically the equation of a standard ellipse centered at the origin with width 2 a and height 2 b is assuming a b the foci are c 0 for formula 2 the standard parametric equation is ellipses are the closed type of conic section a plane curve tracing the intersection of a cone with a plane see figure ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections parabolas and hyperbolas both of which are open and unbounded an angled cross section of a cylinder is also an ellipse an ellipse may also be defined in terms of one focal point and a line outside the ellipse called the directrix for all points on the ellipse the ratio between the distance to the focus and the distance to the directrix is a constant this constant ratio is

doe designed radioactive heat source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtg or stirling radioisotope generators srg it is meant for space applications and is packaged as a stackable module gphss are fueled with plutonium 238 dioxide each module has a temperature of over 600 degrees celsius and delivers 250 watts at the time of manufacture they measure 9 948 cm wide x 9 32 cm deep x 5 82 cm high and weigh no more than 1 44 kg each gphss are designed with safety in mind and employ iridium clad plutonium 238 dioxide pellets the generated alpha particles are blocked by the cladding thus no further radiation shielding is necessary the pellets are encased within nested layers of carbon based material and placed within an aeroshell housing to comprise the complete module the modules can withstand extreme conditions including a launch pad explosion or a high speed reentry overheating and impact tests were performed on several sample modules gphss of this or very similar design were used in the gphs rtgs of cassini huygens new horizons the galileo probe and the ulysses probe they are used in the multi mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator as used by mars science laboratory curiosity

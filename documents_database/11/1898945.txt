buildings of some kinds especially large panel systems and precast concrete buildings are disproportionately more susceptible to collapse others such as in situ cast concrete structures are disproportionately less susceptible the method employed in making a structure robust will typically depend on and be tailored to the kind of structure it is as in steel framed building structural robustness is typically achieved through appropriately designing the system of connections between the frame s constituents three alternative measures are used sometimes jointly to achieve structural robustness and reduce the risk of disproportionate collapse these are the requirements for structures in consequence classes 2 and 3 can be found in eurocode 1 actions on structures part 1 7 general actions accidental actions additional requirements and requirements for structures in consequence class 1 can be found in the material specific eurocode parts en 1992 for concrete structures en 1993 for steel structures and so on in en 1991 1 7 buildings are categorised in consequences classes considering the building type occupancy and size consequence class 1 low consequences of failure consequence class 2a lower risk group medium consequences of failure consequence class 2b upper risk group medium consequences of failure consequence class 3

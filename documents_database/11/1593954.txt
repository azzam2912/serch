these theories hold that sensory systems incorporate information about the statistical properties of the natural world into their design and relate incoming stimuli to this information rather than analyzing sensory stimulation into its components or features visual perception is initiated when objects in the world reflect light rays towards the eye most empirical theories of visual perception begin with the observation that stimulation of the retina is fundamentally ambiguous in empirical accounts the most commonly proposed mechanism for circumventing this ambiguity is unconscious inference a term that dates back to helmholtz according to hatfield alhazen was the first to propose that higher level cognitive processes judgments could supplement sense perception to lead to veridical perception of distance suggesting that these judgments are formally equivalent to syllogisms descartes extended and refined this account berkeley departed from this tradition putting forth the new idea that sensory systems rather than performing logical operations on stimuli to reach veridical conclusions i e these light rays come with certain orientations relative to each other therefore their source is at a certain distance make associations so that for instance if certain co occurring sensory attributes are usually present when an object is at a given distance

in more concise terms this says that the structure group of the frame bundle of e which is the real general linear group gl r can be reduced to the subgroup consisting of those with positive determinant if e is a real vector bundle of rank n then a choice of metric on e amounts to a reduction of the structure group to the orthogonal group o n in that situation an orientation of e amounts to a reduction from o n to the special orthogonal group so n a vector bundle together with an orientation is called an oriented bundle a vector bundle that can be given an orientation is called an orientable vector bundle the basic invariant of an oriented bundle is the euler class the multiplication that is cup product by the euler class of an oriented bundle gives rise to a gysin sequence a complex vector bundle is oriented in a canonical way the notion of an orientation of a vector bundle generalizes an orientation of a manifold an orientation of a manifold is an orientation of the tangent bundle of the manifold in particular a manifold is orientable if and only if its tangent bundle

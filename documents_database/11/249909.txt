in this way the s transform is a generalization of the short time fourier transform stft extending the continuous wavelet transform and overcoming some of its disadvantages for one modulation sinusoids are fixed with respect to the time axis this localizes the scalable gaussian window dilations and translations in s transform moreover the s transform doesn t have a cross term problem and yields a better signal clarity than gabor transform however the s transform has its own disadvantages the clarity is worse than wigner distribution function and cohen s class distribution function a fast s transform algorithm was invented in 2010 it reduces the computational complexity from o n log n to o n log n and makes the transform one to one where the transform has the same number of points as the source signal or image compared to storage complexity of n for the original formulation an implementation is available to the research community under an open source license a general formulation of the s transform makes clear the relationship to other time frequency transforms such as the fourier short time fourier and wavelet transforms there are several ways to represent the idea of the s transform

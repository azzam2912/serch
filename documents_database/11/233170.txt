in contrast to other coherent digital phase modulation techniques where the carrier phase abruptly resets to zero at the start of every symbol e g m psk with cpm the carrier phase is modulated in a continuous manner for instance with qpsk the carrier instantaneously jumps from a sine to a cosine i e a 90 degree phase shift whenever one of the two message bits of the current symbol differs from the two message bits of the previous symbol this discontinuity requires a relatively large percentage of the power to occur outside of the intended band e g high fractional out of band power leading to poor spectral efficiency furthermore cpm is typically implemented as a constant envelope waveform i e the transmitted carrier power is constant therefore cpm is attractive because the phase continuity yields high spectral efficiency and the constant envelope yields excellent power efficiency the primary drawback is the high implementation complexity required for an optimal receiver each symbol is modulated by gradually changing the phase of the carrier from the starting value to the final value over the symbol duration the modulation and demodulation of cpm is complicated by the fact that the initial phase

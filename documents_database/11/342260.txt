typically orthents are exceedingly shallow soils they are often referred to as skeletal soils or in the fao soil classification as lithosols the basic requirement for recognition of an orthent is that any former soil has been either completely removed or so truncated that the diagnostic horizons typical of all orders other than entisols are absent most orthents are found in very steep mountainous regions where erodible material is so rapidly removed by erosion that a permanent covering of deep soil cannot establish itself such conditions occur in almost all regions of the world where steep slopes are prevalent in australia and a few regions of africa orthents occur in flat terrain because the parent rock contains absolutely no weatherable minerals except short lived additions from rainfall so that there is no breaking down of the minerals chiefly iron oxides in the rock the steepness of most orthents causes the flora on them to be sparse shrubs or grassland in those on ancient flat terrain dry grassland savanna or rarely rainforest can prevail because of their extreme shallowness and usually steepness and consequent high erosion hazard orthents are not suitable for arable farming the flora typically supported on them is

this means that strong security can be obtained using weak passwords password authenticated key agreement generally encompasses methods such as in the most stringent password only security models there is no requirement for the user of the method to remember any secret or public data other than the password password authenticated key exchange pake is where two or more parties based only on their knowledge of a password establish a cryptographic key using an exchange of messages such that an unauthorized party one who controls the communication channel but does not possess the password cannot participate in the method and is constrained as much as possible from brute force guessing the password the optimal case yields exactly one guess per run exchange two forms of pake are balanced and augmented methods balanced pake allows parties that use the same password to negotiate and authenticate a shared key examples of these are augmented pake is a variation applicable to client server scenarios in which the server does not store password equivalent data this means that an attacker that stole the server data still cannot masquerade as the client unless they first perform a brute force search for the password examples include

it is also known as cass3 efs embryonal fyn associated substrate also known as sin src interacting or signal integrating protein was originally identified using cdna library screening of mouse embryonal libraries for proteins containing sh3 interacting domains or interacting with the src sh3 domain in two independent studies by ishino et al in 1995 and alexandropoulos et al in 1996 in humans the 561 amino acid efs protein acts as a scaffolding protein for cell signaling based on interactions with src fak and other proteins and has been linked to roles in the function of the immune system and the development of cancer the chromosomal location of the efs gene is 14q11 2 and its genomic coordinates are 14 23356400 23365633 on the reverse strand in grchb38p2 genome reference consortium human build 38 patch release 2 according to the human genome organization hugo gene nomenclature committee hgnc its approved symbol is efs and its synonyms are cas scaffolding protein family member 3 cass3 efs1 efs2 hefs and sin the official gene ids assigned to efs are 16898 hgnc 10278 entrez gene and ensg00000100842 ensembl in humans at least three transcript variants are known for efs isoform 1 containing 6

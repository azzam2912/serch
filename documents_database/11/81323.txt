and 3 but which nevertheless don t satisfy the wigner d espagnat inequality for instance if three observers a b and c had each detected signals in one of two distinct own channels e g as hit a vs miss a hit b vs miss b and hit c vs miss c respectively over several at least pairwise defined trials then non negative ratios n may be evaluated appropriately labelled and found to satisfy however if the pairwise orientation angles between these three observers are determined following the inverse of a quantum mechanical interpretation of malus s law from the measured ratios as and if a s b s and c s channels are considered having been properly set up only if the constraints orientation angle a b orientation angle b c orientation angle a c 2 had been found satisfied as one may well require to any accuracy where the accuracy depends on the number of trials from which the orientation angle values were obtained then necessarily given sufficient accuracy cos orientation angle a c since 1 n n therefore 1 2 n n 1 2 n n 1 2 n n 1 2 n n 1 n n

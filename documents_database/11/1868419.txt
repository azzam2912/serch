it was originally published in 2011 by cambridge university press the purpose of the atlas is to display and describe some of the best multiwavelength images of galaxies the images originate from a variety of telescopes instruments and detectors and therefore possess wide ranges of signal to noise angular resolution sampling or pixel sizes and fields of view the atlas is a compendium of galaxy images spanning the gamma ray x ray ultraviolet optical infrared submillimeter and radio regions of the electromagnetic spectrum the atlas has been favourably reviewed in the royal astronomical society journal astronomy geophysics creating the atlas was a long term project ten years in the making background on the genesis of the atlas can be found in an interview with the author in the swinburne university of technology venture magazine it is recommended for graduate students and above explanatory text describes how different radiation is produced which objects i e cold warm or hot gas dust stars particles atoms and molecules it originates from and what types of telescopes are used to detect it the galaxies are divided into categories of normal n interacting i merging m starburst s and active a though many have been

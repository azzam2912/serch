firstly if time originated at the big bang then what series of conditions led to the big bang itself how did such conditions develop in the absence of time a similar problem involves space if we don t want to consider the universe as spatially infinite then there should be something else containing it and something containing what s containing it recursively ad infinitum infinite regress in consciousness is the formation of an infinite series of inner observers as we ask the question of who is observing the output of the neural correlates of consciousness in the study of subjective consciousness infinite regress is akin to the optical phenomenon wherein an infinite sequence of receding images is formed between two parallel facing mirrors a similar process occurs in optical feedback libertarian free will asserts that human actions do not have causes and are chosen consciously i e are not random this raises a serious question what are these conscious decisions based on since they can t be based on nothing as the possibility of decisions being random is excluded this question can be asked for each subsequent answer or answers to it thus forming an infinite regress

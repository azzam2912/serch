they are used to synthesize oligonucleotides relatively short fragments of nucleic acid and their analogs nucleoside phosphoramidites were first introduced in 1981 by beaucage and caruthers to avoid undesired side reactions reactive hydroxy and exocyclic amino groups present in natural or synthetic nucleosides are appropriately protected as long as a nucleoside analog contains at least one hydroxy group the use of the appropriate protecting strategy allows one to convert that to the respective phosphoramidite and to incorporate the latter into synthetic nucleic acids to be incorporated in the middle of an oligonucleotide chain using phosphoramidite strategy the nucleoside analog must possess two hydroxy groups or less often a hydroxy group and another nucleophilic group amino or mercapto examples include but are not limited to alternative nucleotides lna morpholino nucleosides modified at the 2 position ome protected nh f nucleosides containing non canonical bases hypoxanthine and xanthine contained in natural nucleosides inosine and xanthosine respectively tricyclic bases such as g clamp etc or bases derivatized with a fluorescent group or a linker arm there are three main methods for the preparation of nucleoside phosphoramidites nucleoside phosphoramidites are purified by column chromatography on silica gel to warrant the stability of the phosphoramidite

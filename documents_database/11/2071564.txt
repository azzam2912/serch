they can be added to monomer formulations to counteract the usual volume shrinking during polymerization to manufacture products with higher quality and durability volume shrinkage is in first line for the unmeltable thermosets a problem since those are of fixed shape after polymerization completed the quality of thermosets crosslinked polymers is determined by a numerous factors such as the purity of the used monomer polymerization time and temperature stoichiometry of comonomers when used or type and quantity of catalyst or initiator another rarely minded factor is the volume shrinking and density increase during polymerization actually all polymers are shrinking during polymerization to some degree this volume shrinkage can lead after the gel point to mechanical stress within the polymer internal stress which may cause microfractures worse mechanical properties or detaching form the substrate expandable monomers occupy after polymerization a greater volume than before and were designed to counteract the volumetric shrinkage upon addition for other applications like precision castings or dental fillings a slight expansion during polymerization would be desirable for complete filling of a given mold nonetheless for some applications even a small shrinkage can be desirable as for one piece molds to accomplish an easy removal expanding monomers

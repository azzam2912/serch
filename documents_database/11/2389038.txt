very little research and as of 1997 no boreholes have managed to reach underlying precambrian rock most likely deeper basement rocks are part of the afro arabian plate formed into a craton in the proterozoic northeastern iraq has a thinned quasicontinental crust due to neo tethys extensional faulting and plastic deformation of rocks in the paleozoic the arabian plate was an extension of the african plate and a part of gondwana oriented to paleo tethys ocean to the north grabens formed accumulating thicker sediments although sedimentary rocks overall ranged up to four kilometers thick drilling in the western desert penetrated the khabour quartzite formation down 1 67 kilometers without leading to depth estimates in grabens of three kilometers in the late silurian deposition paused twice due to the caledonian orogeny and the hercynian orogeny resulted in a deposition break in the carboniferous and permian the khabour quartzite is overlain by the akkaz formation the pirispiki red beds and chalki volcanics from the devonian are related to the global kaskaskia marine transgression event along with the ora shale and a sequence of limestone formations the ga ara formation and the chia zairi limestone formation deposited in the permian chia zairi rocks

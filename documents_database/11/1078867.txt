he is known for being the first to apply boltzmann s entropy formula to the modeling of rubber molecules i e the rubber band entropy model molecules which he imagined as chains of n independently oriented links of length b with an end to end distance of r this model which resulted in the derivation of the thermal equation of state of rubber has since been extrapolated to the entropic modeling of proteins and other conformational polymer chained molecules attached to a surface kuhn received a degree in chemical engineering at the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth federal institute of technology in z rich and later a doctorate 1923 in physical chemistry he was appointed professor of physical chemistry at the university of kiel 1936 39 and then returned to switzerland as director of the physico chemical institute of the university of basel 1939 63 where he also served as rector 1955 56 in a 1951 lecture along with his student v b hargitay he was the first to hypothesize the countercurrent multiplier mechanism in the mammalian kidney later to be discovered in many other similar biological systems kuhn length

the record was released via naim label on 1 march 2004 john kelman of all about jazz wrote taylor s touch is deft as always haden s sound is characteristically visceral resonating deep in the body spartan yet strangely elegant one can almost feel him choose the absolutely right note for the moment on this introspective programme haden and taylor create moments of unadulterated beauty the almost painful poignancy of touch her soft lips is a benchmark for the rest of the recording as is the melancholy my love and i impeccably recorded live with no editing nightfall puts two players with different approaches together the result is both hauntingly beautiful and a lesson in simplicity ian latham of bbc stated nightfall is an album of deeply introspective ballads the partnership of these two experimental but extraordinarily melodic and expressive players is ideal one senses that this is music for musicians it is a real pleasure to listen to the quiet power of these master musicians who treat jazz as high art let s hope that this transatlantic collaboration is developed further band production

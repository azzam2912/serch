it is distributed as free software titan2d is a free software application developed by the geophysical mass flow group at the state university of new york suny at buffalo titan2d was developed for the purpose of simulating granular flows primarily geological mass flows such as debris avalanches and landslides over digital elevation models dem s of natural terrain the code is designed to help scientists and civil protection authorities assess the risk of and mitigate hazards due to dry debris flows and avalanches titan2d combines numerical simulations of a flow with digital elevation data of natural terrain supported through a geographical information system gis interface such as grass titan2d is capable of multiprocessor runs a message passing interface mpi application programming interface api allows for parallel computing on multiple processors which effectively increases computational power decreases computing time and allows for the use of large data sets adaptive gridding allows for the concentration of computing power on regions of special interest mesh refinement captures the complex flow features that occur at the leading edge of a flow as well as locations where rapid changes in topography induce large mass and momentum fluxes mesh unrefinement is applied where solution values are

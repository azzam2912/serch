the process of melanization depends on activation of the enzyme phenoxidase po which is controlled by the prophenoloxidase propo activation system during activation of propo cascade many other immune reaction are produced such as cytotoxic opsonic and encapsulation activities the phenoxidase cascade plays an important role in invertebrates especially insects in three physiologically important processes immune reactions sclerotization of the cuticle and wound healing the phenoxidase system begins with the recognition of microbial pamps pathogen associated molecular patterns including lps gram negative bacteria peptidoglycans gram positive bacteria and 1 3 glucans fungi interaction of pamps with prps pattern recognition proteins activates a series of serine proteinases and those proteolytically cleave the prophenoloxidase propo zymogen and activate phenoxidase po during the propo system activation reactive intermediates such as quinone like intermediates reactive oxygen roi or nitrogen intermediates are produced these have cytotoxic activity against microorganisms prevent organism from entering of another pathogen and also assist in wound healing active po plays an important role in the initial stages of the melanization process the po catalyses a hydroxylation of monophenols tyrosine on diphenols and oxidation of diphenols to dichinones the chinones non enzymatically change their structure to dopachrome and than dopachrome isomerase

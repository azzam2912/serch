in cascade reactions isolation of intermediates is not required as each reaction composing the sequence occurs spontaneously in the strictest definition of the term the reaction conditions do not change among the consecutive steps of a cascade and no new reagents are added after the initial step by contrast one pot procedures similarly allow at least two reactions to be carried out consecutively without any isolation of intermediates but do not preclude the addition of new reagents or the change of conditions after the first reaction thus any cascade reaction is also a one pot procedure while the reverse does not hold true although often composed solely of intramolecular transformations cascade reactions can also occur intermolecularly in which case they also fall under the category of multicomponent reactions the main benefits of cascade sequences include high atom economy and reduction of waste generated by the several chemical processes as well as of the time and work required to carry them out the efficiency and utility of a cascade reaction can be measured in terms of the number of bonds formed in the overall sequence the degree of increase in the structural complexity via the process and its applicability to broader

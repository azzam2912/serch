both non rechargeable primary cell and rechargeable secondary cell chemistries have been investigated magnesium primary cell batteries have been commercialised and have found use as reserve and general use batteries magnesium secondary cell batteries are an active topic of research specifically as a possible replacement or improvement over lithium ion based battery chemistries in certain applications a significant advantage of magnesium cells is their use of a solid magnesium anode allowing a higher energy density cell design than that made with lithium which in many instances requires an intercalated lithium anode insertion type anodes magnesium ion have also been researched primary magnesium cells have been developed since the early 20th century a number of chemistries for reserve battery types have been researched with cathode materials including silver chloride copper i chloride palladium ii chloride copper i iodide copper i thiocyanate manganese dioxide and air oxygen for example a water activated silver chloride magnesium reserve battery became commercially available by 1943 the magnesium dry battery type ba 4386 was fully commercialised with costs per unit approaching that of zinc batteries in comparison to equivalent zinc carbon cells the batteries had greater capacity by volume and longer shelf life the ba 4386

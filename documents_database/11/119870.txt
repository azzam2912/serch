in the late 1950s and early 1960s the company studied a number of models as part of a large british inter company effort funded by the government these models eventually culminated in the type 223 a transatlantic transport for about 100 passengers at a speed around mach 2 at about the same time sud aviation in france was developing the similar super caravelle design and in november 1962 the efforts were merged to create the concorde project in the uk as elsewhere in the 1950s the aero industry had been producing a series of supersonic test aircraft and had extensively studied the problems of sustained high speed flight by the mid 1950s two designs had been shown to have a lift to drag ratio suitable for supersonic cruise a sharply swept m wing pioneered at armstrong whitworth for slightly supersonic flight and very slender delta wings suitable for a wide range of speeds higher speeds up to mach 3 had been considered and found to be possible but it appeared that a practical upper limit was mach 2 2 above this speed the duralumin used for most aircraft construction would start to soften due to the heat of friction and

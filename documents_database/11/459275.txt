it is defined by standard as about this value was established by the 3rd cgpm 1901 cr 70 and used to define the standard weight of an object as the product of its mass and this nominal acceleration the acceleration of a body near the surface of the earth is due to the combined effects of gravity and centrifugal acceleration from the rotation of the earth but which is small enough to be neglected for most purposes the total the apparent gravity is about 0 5 greater at the poles than at the equator although the symbol is sometimes used for standard gravity without a suffix can also mean the local acceleration due to local gravity and centrifugal acceleration which varies depending on one s position on earth see earth s gravity the symbol should not be confused with the gravitational constant or g the symbol for gram the is also used as a unit for any form of acceleration with the value defined as above see g force the value of defined above is a nominal midrange value on earth originally based on the acceleration of a body in free fall at sea level at a geodetic latitude of

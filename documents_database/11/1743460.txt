it is known however that humans can perceive sounds below this frequency at very high pressure levels infrasound can come from many natural as well as man made sources including weather patterns topographic features ocean wave activity thunderstorms geomagnetic storms earthquakes jet streams mountain ranges and rocket launchings infrasounds are also present in the vocalizations of some animals low frequency sounds can travel for long distances with very little attenuation and can be detected hundreds of miles away from their sources the production and perception of infrasound has been observed in multiple mammals including whale elephant giraffe hippopotamus and rhinoceros for most of these animals observations are preliminary and their sensitivity to infrasound has not been quantified if an animal produces a low frequency sound and uses it in communication it suggests the animal might also be sensitive to infrasound elephants are the terrestrial animal in which the production of infrasonic calls was first noted by m krishnan later discovered by katy payne the use of low frequency sounds to communicate over long distances may explain certain elephant behaviors that have previously puzzled observers elephant groups that are separated by several kilometers have been observed to travel in parallel or

the symbol of specific weight is the greek letter gamma a commonly used value is the specific weight of water on earth at 4 c which is 9 807 kn m or 62 43 lbf ft the terms specific gravity and less often specific weight are also used for relative density where unlike density specific weight is not absolute it depends upon the value of the gravitational acceleration which varies with location pressure may also affect values depending upon the bulk modulus of the material but generally at moderate pressures has a less significant effect than the other factors in fluid mechanics specific weight represents the force exerted by gravity on a unit volume of a fluid for this reason units are expressed as force per unit volume e g n m or lbf ft specific weight can be used as a characteristic property of a fluid specific weight is often used as a property of soil to solve earthwork problems in soil mechanics specific weight may refer to where the formula for dry unit weight is where the formula for saturated unit weight is where the formula for submerged unit weight is where specific weight can be used in

they can be divided into 45 50 genera and were sometimes treated as a separate family heliconiidae within the papilionoidea the colouration is predominantly reddish and black and though of varying wing shape the forewings are always elongated tipwards hence the common name most longwings are found in the tropics particularly in south america only the argynnini are quite diverse in the holarctic especially tropical species feed on poisonous plants characteristically passifloraceae vines as larvae becoming poisonous themselves the adult butterflies announce their acquired toxicity with strong aposematic colours warning off would be predators there are several famous cases of batesian and m llerian mimicry both within this group and with other butterflies other commonly seen food plants are fabaceae which also contain several toxic species and particularly among northerly species of violaceae four or five tribes are generally recognized in the heliconiinae there have been numerous attempts to sort out the phylogenetic sequence and delimitation of these but while the former has made good progress the latter has hitherto only achieved limited results several phylogenies and corresponding taxonomic adjustments have been proposed but though looking reasonable each and every one of them is only weakly supported even cladistic analyses

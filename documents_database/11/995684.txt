this rna regulates the glms gene by responding to concentrations of a specific metabolite glucosamine 6 phosphate glcn6p in addition to catalyzing a self cleaving chemical reaction upon activation this cleavage leads to the degradation of the mrna that contains the ribozyme and lowers production of glcn6p the glms gene encodes for an enzyme glutamine fructose 6 phosphate amidotransferase which catalyzes the formation of glcn6p a compound essential for cell wall biosynthesis from fructose 6 phosphate and glutamine thus when glcn6p levels are high the glms ribozyme is activated and the mrna transcript is degraded but in the absence of glcn6p the gene continues to be translated into glutamine fructose 6 phosphate amidotransferase and glcn6p is produced glcn6p is a cofactor for this cleavage reaction as it directly participates as an acid base catalyst this rna is the first riboswitch also found to be a self cleaving ribozyme and like many others was discovered using a bioinformatics approach the structure of the glms ribozyme was first determined by x ray crystallography in 2006 the tertiary structure of this rna is characterized by three coaxial stacked helices packed side by side the ribozyme core contains a double pseudoknotted structure which places

in former times they were included in the osmeriformes typical smelt and allies as suborder argentinoidei that term refers only to the suborder of marine smelts and barreleyes in the classification used here with the slickheads and allies being the alepocephaloidei these suborders were treated as superfamilies argentinoidea and alepocephaloidea respectively when the present group was still included in the osmeriformes they contain six or seven families with almost 60 genera and at least 228 species a common name for the group is marine smelts and allies but this is rather misleading since the freshwater smelts of the osmeridae also live predominantly in the ocean the argentiniformes are smallish silvery or dark and generally bathypelagic ocean fishes some argentinoidei have an adipose fin which is unusually for protacanthopterygii to which they belong missing in the rest of the order the dorsal fin is located in the second half of the body they have a physoclistous gas bladder or lack it entirely teeth are absent in almost all the hypaxial muscle is unusually extended to forward at its upper end and attaches to the neurocranium below the spine perhaps to snap the upper part of the skull down when catching prey

molecular analysis indicates that fomitopsis belongs to the antrodia clade which contains about 70 percent of brown rot fungi other genera that join fomitopsis in the core antrodia group include amyloporia antrodia daedalea melanoporia piptoporus and rhodonia studies have indicated that fomitopsis and piptoporus were phylogenetically heterogenous and the type of that genus piptoporus betulinus is in the fomitopsis core group this fungus well known for its use by tzi the iceman was transferred to fomitopsis in 2016 the whole genome sequence of fomitopsis palustris was reported in 2017 the generic name combines the name fomes with the ancient greek word appearance fomitopsis species have fruit bodies that are mostly perennial with forms ranging from sessile to effused reflexed partially crust like and partially pileate fruit body texture is typically tough to woody and the pore surface is white to tan or pinkish colored with mostly small and regular pores microscopically fomitopsis has a dimitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae the spores are hyaline thin walled smooth roughly spherical to cylindrical and are negative in melzer s reagent fomitopsis fungi cause a brown rot more than 40 species have been accepted in fomitopsis

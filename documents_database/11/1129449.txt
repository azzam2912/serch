the 20s core is composed of 4 rings of 28 non identical subunits 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits the 19s regulator is composed of a base which contains 6 atpase subunits and 2 non atpase subunits and a lid which contains up to 10 non atpase subunits proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an atp ubiquitin dependent process in a non lysosomal pathway an essential function of a modified proteasome the immunoproteasome is the processing of class i mhc peptides this gene encodes one of the non atpase subunits of the 19s regulator lid the proteasome and its subunits are of clinical significance for at least two reasons 1 a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases and 2 they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions more recently more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies an improved and comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future the proteasomes

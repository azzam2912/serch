temperature pressure equations of state and transport laws all play an important role in thermofluid problems phase transition and chemical reactions may also be important in a thermofluid context the subject is sometimes also referred to as thermal fluids heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the transfer of thermal energy from one physical system to another heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms such as heat conduction convection thermal radiation and phase change transfer engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species either cold or hot to achieve heat transfer sections include thermodynamics is the science of energy conversion involving heat and other forms of energy most notably mechanical work it studies and interrelates the macroscopic variables such as temperature volume and pressure which describe physical thermodynamic systems fluid mechanics the study of the physical forces at work during fluid flow fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid kinematics the study of fluid motion and fluid kinetics the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion fluid mechanics can further be divided into fluid statics the study of fluids at rest and fluid dynamics the study of fluids in motion some of

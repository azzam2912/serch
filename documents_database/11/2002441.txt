polymers are common but not limited to organic media they range from familiar synthetic plastics to natural biopolymers such as dna and proteins their unique elongated molecular structure produces unique physical properties including toughness viscoelasticity and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures the modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by hermann staudinger one sub field in the study of polymers is polymer physics as a part of soft matter studies polymer physics concerns itself with the study of mechanical properties and focuses on the perspective of condensed matter physics because polymers are such large molecules bordering on the macroscopic scale their physical properties are usually too complicated for solving using deterministic methods therefore statistical approaches are often implemented to yield pertinent results the main reason for this relative success is that polymers constructed from a large number of monomers are efficiently described in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many monomers although in actuality they are obviously finite in size thermal fluctuations continuously affect the shape of polymers in liquid solutions and modeling their effect requires using principles from statistical mechanics and dynamics the path integral approach falls in line with this

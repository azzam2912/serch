the underlying model represents a modified version of the relative environmental suitability res model developed by kristin kaschner to generate global predictions of marine mammal occurrences according to the aquamaps website on august 2013 the project held standardized distribution maps for over 17 300 species of fishes marine mammals and invertebrates the project is also expanding to incorporate freshwater species with more than 600 biodiversity maps for freshwater fishes of the americas available as at november 2009 aquamaps predictions have been validated successfully for a number of species using independent data sets and the model was shown to perform equally well or better than other standard species distribution models when faced with the currently existing suboptimal input data sets in addition to displaying individual maps per species aquamaps provides tools to generate species richness maps by higher taxon plus a spatial search for all species overlapping a specified grid square there is also the facility to create custom maps for any species via the web by modifying the input parameters and re running the map generating algorithm in real time and a variety of other tools including the investigation of effects of climate change on species distributions see relevant section

carbon nanotubes cnts can be thought of as single atomic layer graphite sheets rolled up to form seamless cylinders depending on the direction on which they are rolled cnts can be semiconducting or metallic metallic carbon nanotubes have been identified as a possible interconnect material for the future technology generations and to replace copper interconnects electron transport can go over long nanotube lengths 1 m enabling cnts to carry very high currents i e up to a current density of 10 a cm with essentially no heating due to nearly one dimensional electronic structure despite the current saturation in cnts at high fields the mitigation of such effects is possible due to encapsulated nanowires carbon nanotubes for interconnects application in integrated chips have been studied since 2001 however the extremely attractive performances of individual tubes are difficult to reach when they are assembled in large bundles necessary to make real via or lines in integrated chips two proposed approaches to overcome the to date limitations are either to make very tiny local connections that will be needed in future advanced chips or to make carbon metal composite structure that will be compatible with existing microelectronic processes hybrid interconnects that employ

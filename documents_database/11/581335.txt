this diversity has led to much confusion in the naming of wheats this article explains how genetic and morphological characteristics of wheat influence its classification and gives the most common botanical names of wheat in current use see table of wheat species information on the cultivation and uses of wheat is at the main wheat page the genus triticum includes the wild and domesticated species usually thought of as wheat in the 1950s growing awareness of the genetic similarity of the wild goatgrasses aegilops led botanists such as bowden to amalgamate aegilops and triticum as one genus triticum this approach is still followed by some mainly geneticists but has not been widely adopted by taxonomists aegilops is morphologically highly distinct from triticum with rounded rather than keeled glumes aegilops is important in wheat evolution because of its role in two important hybridisation events wild emmer t dicoccoides and t araraticum resulted from the hybridisation of a wild wheat t urartu and an as yet unidentified goatgrass probably closely related to ae speltoides hexaploid wheats e g t aestivum and t spelta are the result of a hybridisation between a domesticated tetraploid wheat probably t dicoccum or t durum and another

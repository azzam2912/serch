the term pulmonary circulation is readily paired and contrasted with the systemic circulation the vessels of the pulmonary circulation are the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins a separate system known as the bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung deoxygenated blood leaves the heart goes to the lungs and then re enters the heart deoxygenated blood leaves through the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery from the right atrium the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve or right atrioventricular valve into the right ventricle blood is then pumped from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve and into the main pulmonary artery the pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is picked up during respiration arteries are further divided into very fine capillaries which are extremely thin walled the pulmonary vein returns oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart the oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through pulmonary veins which return it to the left part of the heart completing the pulmonary cycle this blood then enters the left atrium which pumps it through the mitral valve into the left

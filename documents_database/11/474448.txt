the apparent visual magnitude of tau scorpii is 2 8 while parallax measurements yield a distance estimate of roughly 470 light years 150 parsecs from earth compared to the sun tau scorpii is a massive ob star with 15 times the sun s mass and more than six times the radius of the sun it is radiating about 20 400 times the sun s luminosity from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 31 440 k this gives it the blue white hue characteristic of b type stars as yet there is no evidence of a companion in orbit around sco it is a magnetic star whose surface magnetic field was mapped by means of zeeman doppler imaging tau scorpii is rotating relatively slowly with a period of 41 days the spectrum of this star shows triply ionized oxygen o iv that is being generated by x rays and the auger ionization effect observations with the rosat space telescope showed it has a higher energy harder x ray spectrum than is usual for b0 v stars over the energy range 0 8 1 2 kev its x ray luminosity is l with a large l to l of log

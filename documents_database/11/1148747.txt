this reaction typically is expressed as the stoichiometry of c s h in cement paste is variable and the state of chemically and physically bound water in its structure is not transparent which is why is used between c s and h synthetic c s h can be prepared from the reaction of cao and sio in water or through the double precipitation method using various salts these methods provide the flexibility of producing c s h at specific c s ratios the c s h from cement phases can also be treated with ammonium nitrate in order to achieve desired c s ratio c s h is a nano sized material with some degree of crystallinity as observed by x ray diffraction techniques the underlying atomic structure of c s h is similar to the naturally occurring mineral tobermorite it has a layered geometry with calcium silicate sheet structure separated by an interlayer space the silicates in c s h exist as dimers pentamers and 3n 1 chain units where n is an integer greater than 0 and calcium ions are found to connect these chains making the three dimensional nano structure as observed by dnp surface enhanced nmr

it was discovered on 15 august 1939 by german astronomer karl reinmuth at heidelberg observatory in southern germany the asteroid was named after composer johannes brahms brahms orbits the sun in the inner main belt at a distance of 1 8 2 6 au once every 3 years and 2 months 1 163 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 18 and an inclination of 3 with respect to the ecliptic brahms was first identified as at the discovering observatory in 1904 extending the body s observation arc by 35 years prior to its official discovery observation as of 2017 brahms effective size albedo and spectral type as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown based on a magnitude to diameter conversion its generic diameter is between 5 and 11 kilometer for an absolute magnitude of 13 8 and an assumed albedo in the range of 0 05 to 0 25 since asteroids in the inner main belt are typically of stony rather than carbonaceous composition with albedos of 0 20 or higher brahms s diameter can be estimate to measure around 6 kilometers as the higher its albedo reflectivity the lower the body s diameter at

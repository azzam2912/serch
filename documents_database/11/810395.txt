telepathy enables the creation of communications applications using components via the d bus inter process communication mechanism through this it aims to simplify development of communications applications and promote code reuse within the free software and open source communities by defining a logical boundary between the applications and underlying network protocols there are free software implementations of various protocols that export telepathy interfaces mission control is the name of the component that provides a way for end user applications to abstract some details of low level telepathy components such as connection managers tubes are telepathy s mechanism for supporting arbitrary data transfer and remote ipc telepathy forms the basis of the instant messaging and voice video calling software on the nokia 770 n800 n810 n900 n9 and jolla protocol implementations provide a d bus service called a connection manager telepathy clients use these to create connections to services once a connection is established further communication happens using objects called channels which are requested from the connection a channel might be used to send and receive text messages or represent the contact list or to establish a voip call

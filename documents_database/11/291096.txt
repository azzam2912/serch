a point in n dimensional space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes the position of the vertex on the i th axis corresponds to the i th coordinate of the point this visualization is closely related to time series visualization except that it is applied to data where the axes do not correspond to points in time and therefore do not have a natural order therefore different axis arrangements may be of interest parallel coordinates were often said to be invented by philbert maurice d ocagne in 1885 but even though the words coordonn es parall les appear in the book title this work has nothing to do with the visualization techniques of the same name the book only describes a method of coordinate transformation but even before 1885 parallel coordinates were used for example in henry gannetts general summary showing the rank of states by ratios 1880 or afterwards in henry gannetts rank of states and territories in population at each census 1790 1890 in 1898 they were popularised again 79 years later by alfred inselberg in 1959 and systematically developed as a coordinate system starting from 1977 some important applications are in collision

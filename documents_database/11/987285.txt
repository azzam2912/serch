of czech and appalachian descent he was raised in texas lower rio grande valley an early interest in topology was strongly encouraged by his parents he enrolled at rice university in 1962 as a physics major but with the help of jim douglas entered the graduate mathematics program in 1964 his advisor eldon dyer arranged with the support of michael atiyah a one year fellowship at the university of oxford followed by a year in princeton at the institute for advanced study morava brought ideas from arithmetic geometry into the realm of algebraic topology under atiyah s tutelage morava concentrated on the relation between k theory and cobordism and when daniel quillen s work on that subject appeared he saw that ideas of sergei novikov implied close connections between the stable homotopy category and the derived category of quasicoherent sheaves on the moduli stack of one dimensional formal groups in particular that the category of spectra is naturally stratified by height using work of dennis sullivan he focused attention on certain ring spectra parametrized by one dimensional formal group laws over a field which generalize classical topological k theory from a modern point of view i e since michael j

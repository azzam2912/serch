paul in his first epistle to the corinthians as a charism the gift is imparted to individuals by the power of the holy spirit the view of cessationism held that the charismata were exclusively for apostolic times and therefore the gift of miracles ceased with the writing of the last book of the bible or the death of st john the apostle in continuationism on the other hand the gifts are held to be possible throughout the history of christianity and to have occurred since apostolic times in catholicism the gift is one of the extraordinary graces of the holy spirit imparted to certain individuals so that christ s doctrine may become credible and christians confirmed in their faith although miracles are necessarily the work of god men and angels may be said to work miracles in a threefold way like other charismata these are special and extraordinary powers vouchsafed by god only to a few and primarily for the spiritual good of others rather than of the recipient in pentecostal and charismatic christianity it is believed that god continues to operate this gift through believers with the gift of faith this gift does not however make one a miracle

it is split into two main groups notosuchia and neosuchia notosuchia is an extinct group that contains primarily small bodied cretaceous taxa with heterodont dentition neosuchia includes the extant crocodylians and basal taxa such as peirosaurids and pholidosaurids it is phylogenetically defined by sereno et al 2001 as a clade containing notosuchus terrestris crocodylus niloticus and all descendants of their common ancestor the phylogeny of basal metasuchians has experienced many revisions in recent years the phylogeny of notosuchians has been particularly revised with the construction of sebecia by larsson and sues 2007 to include peirosaurids in the clade previously peirosaurids were placed outside notosuchia larsson and sues 2007 also suggested that sebecosuchia containing the families baurusuchidae and sebecidae was polyphyletic as baurusuchus was placed outside sebecia which itself was placed outside notosuchia however more recent phylogenetic studies have placed baurusuchus within notosuchia once again although it is still not considered to be a sebecosuchian in 2012 a phylogenetic study was done to produce supertrees of crocodyliformes including 184 species the most parsimonious trees were highly resolved meaning the phylogenetic relationships found in the analysis were highly likely as such below is the consensus tree from the study focusing on the

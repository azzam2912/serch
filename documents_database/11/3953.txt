the first possible evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917 but was not recognized as such the first confirmation of detection occurred in 1992 this was followed by the confirmation of a planet detected in 1988 there are many methods of detecting exoplanets transit photometry and doppler spectroscopy have found the most but these methods suffer from a clear observational bias favoring the detection of planets near the star thus 85 of the exoplanets detected are inside the tidal locking zone in several cases multiple planets have been observed around a star about 1 in 5 sun like stars have an earth sized planet in the habitable zone assuming there are 200 billion stars in the milky way it can be hypothesized that there are 11 billion potentially habitable earth sized planets in the milky way rising to 40 billion if planets orbiting the numerous red dwarfs are included the least massive planet known is draugr also known as psr b1257 12 a or psr b1257 12 b which is about twice the mass of the moon the most massive planet listed on the nasa exoplanet archive is hr 2562 b about 30 times the mass of jupiter although

no such formula which is efficiently computable is known a number of constraints are known showing what such a formula can and cannot be a simple formula is by wilson s theorem formula 3 is prime if and only if formula 4 thus when formula 3 is prime the first factor in the product becomes one and the formula produces the prime number formula 3 but when formula 3 is not prime the first factor becomes zero and the formula produces the prime number 2 this formula is not an efficient way to generate prime numbers because evaluating formula 8 requires about formula 9 multiplications and reductions formula 10 because the set of primes is a computably enumerable set by matiyasevich s theorem it can be obtained from a system of diophantine equations found an explicit set of 14 diophantine equations in 26 variables such that a given number k 2 is prime if and only if that system has a solution in natural numbers the 14 equations can be used to produce a prime generating polynomial inequality in 26 variables i e is a polynomial inequality in 26 variables and the set of prime numbers is identical to the

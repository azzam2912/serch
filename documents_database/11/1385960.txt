in a recent review cahiez et al argue that as manganese is cheap and benign only iron performs better in these aspects organomanganese compounds have potential as chemical reagents although currently they are not widely used as such despite extensive research the first organomanganese compounds were synthesised in 1937 by gilman and bailee who reacted phenyllithium with manganese ii iodide to form phenylmanganese iodide phmni and diphenylmanganese phmn the reactivity of organomanganese compounds can be compared to that of organomagnesium compounds and organozinc compounds the electronegativity of mn 1 55 is comparable to that of mg 1 31 and zn 1 65 making the carbon atom en 2 55 nucleophilic the reduction potential of mn is also intermediate between mg and zn key disadvantage of organomanganese compounds is that they can be obtained directly from the metal only with difficulty general methods for the synthesis of organomanganese compounds exist organomanganese halides can be obtained by reaction of manganese halides manganese ii bromide manganese ii bromide with organolithium or organomagnesium compounds in transmetallation manganese iodide can be prepared in situ from manganese and iodine in ether further reaction gives the symmetrical diorganomanganese compound organomanganates the ate complex are the most stable

often the definitive host is a predator and the intermediate host is its prey the parasite reproduces sexually in the gut of the definitive host is passed with the feces and ingested by the intermediate host there it eventually enters muscle tissue when the intermediate host is eaten by the definitive host the cycle is completed the definitive host usually does not show any symptoms of infection but the intermediate host does about 130 recognized species are in this genus revision of the taxonomy of the genus is ongoing and all the currently recognised species may be a much smaller number of species that can infect multiple hosts the name sarcocystis is dervived from greek sarx flesh and kystis bladder the organism was first recognised in a mouse by miescher in 1843 his findings were not initially interpreted as involving a protist and the literature referred to the structures he described as miescher s tubules incidentally miescher s son johann friedrich miescher discovered dna similar structures were found in pig muscle in 1865 but these remained unnamed until 1899 when the name sarcocystis miescheriana was proposed for them initially whether these organisms were fungi or protozoa was unclear this uncertainty

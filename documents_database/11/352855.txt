there are a number of ways that incorporating all parts on a single board can reduce costs the primary reason is that solutions with multiple boards require connections between the boards via edge connectors and sometimes include a ribbon cable by connecting devices directly together on the same pcb there is no need for these additional connectors and cables additionally pcb space may be optimized using electronic design automation eda tools resulting in a smaller device as well as further cost savings aesthetically enhanced micro branding is used as well the disadvantages of using a monoboard solution is that they are inflexible to upgrades for example take a personal computer in most personal computers the video card is an external device that plugs into a dedicated slot in the motherboard and may be swapped out with a higher performing card however in small form factor designs a graphics processing unit gpu may be placed directly on the board the typical reason is to reduce size and cost but this removed the ability to later upgrade the device another common example is with data acquisition hardware many daq solutions involve the use of daq modules which are cards that plug into

nastos said the sound quality is not state of the art with burrell s guitar a bit muffled but the overall sound of this highly skilled group a commendation needs to be bestowed on high note records for the process to finally have released these precious sessions from burrell and this excellent quartet a tip of the hat is also in order for one of his very best groups in terms of their cohesion and sheer talent beyond all star groupings on other acclaimed recordings led by the guitarist on all about jazz graham l flanagan stated the sound quality especially during some of wyands solos doesn t quite rise to the level of that heard on burrell s blue note recordings however any lack of sonic perfection lends itself to the overall raw intimate atmosphere while enthusiasts will no doubt enjoy this addition to burrell s canon it s recommended that newbies start with his 1959 blue note live album on view at the five spot cafe once they arrive at this 1976 recording they will already possess a deeper appreciation for burrell s talents that will surely enhance the experience in jazztimes mike joyce wrote prime kenny burrell

strictly speaking the term means either in practice jis encoding usually refers to jis x 0208 character data encoded with jis x 0202 for instance the iana uses the codice 1 label to refer to jis x 0202 and the codice 2 label to refer to the profile thereof defined by other encoding mechanisms for jis characters include the shift jis encoding and euc jp shift jis adds the kanji full width hiragana and full width katakana from jis x 0208 to jis x 0201 in a backward compatible way shift jis is perhaps the most widely used encoding in japan as the compatibility with the single byte jis x 0201 character set made it possible for electronic equipment manufacturers such as cash register manufacturers to offer an upgrade from older cheaper equipment that was not capable of displaying kanji to newer equipment while retaining character set compatibility euc jp is used on unix systems where the jis encodings are incompatible with posix standards a more recent alternative to jis coded characters is unicode ucs coded characters particularly in the utf 8 encoding mechanism the following table compares the features of the three main encoding schemes for jis x 0208

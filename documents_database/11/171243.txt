as a graduate of the university of washington kildall had used their b5500 computer and as such was aware of the potential of high level languages such as espol for systems programming unlike other contemporary languages such as pascal c or basic pl m had no standard input or output routines it included features targeted at the low level hardware specific to the target microprocessors and as such it could support direct access to any location in memory i o ports and the processor interrupt flags in a very efficient manner pl m was the first higher level programming language for microprocessor based computers and was the original implementation language for those parts of the cp m operating system which were not written in assembler many intel and zilog z80 based embedded systems were programmed in pl m during the 1970s and 1980s for instance the firmware of the service processor component of cisc as 400 was written in pl m the original pl m compiler targeted the intel 8008 an updated version generated code for the 8080 processor which would also run on the newer intel 8085 as well as on the zilog z80 family as it is backward

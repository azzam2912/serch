coms integrate cpu memory graphics and bios and common i o interfaces the interfaces are modern using only digital buses such as pci express serial ata ethernet usb and hd audio intel high definition audio all signals are accessible on a high density high speed 220 pin connector although most implementations use intel processors the specification is open for different cpu modules coreexpress modules are mounted on a custom carrier board containing the peripherals required for the specific application in this way small but highly specialized computer systems can be built the coreexpress form factor was originally developed by lippert embedded computers and standardized by the small form factor special interest group in march 2010 the specification defines a board size of 58 mm 65 mm slightly smaller than a credit card and small enough to allow a carrier board in standard pc 104 plus format the module can be embedded into a heat spreader which distributes the component generated heat onto a larger surface area in low power applications this distribution may be enough for complete thermal dissipation in higher power applications the heat spreader presents a thermal interface for mating to additional heat dissipating components such as finned

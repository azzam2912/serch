apm strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to maintain an expected level of service apm is the translation of it metrics into business meaning i e value two sets of performance metrics are closely monitored the first set of performance metrics defines the performance experienced by end users of the application one example of performance is average response times under peak load the components of the set include load and response times the second set of performance metrics measures the computational resources used by the application for the load indicating whether there is adequate capacity to support the load as well as possible locations of a performance bottleneck measurement of these quantities establishes an empirical performance baseline for the application the baseline can then be used to detect changes in performance changes in performance can be correlated with external events and subsequently used to predict future changes in application performance the use of apm is common for web applications which lends itself best to the more detailed monitoring techniques in addition to measuring response time for a user response times for components of a web application can also be monitored to help pinpoint causes of delay there

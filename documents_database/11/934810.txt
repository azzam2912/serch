in the case of top fermenting ale yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the yeast creates a kreuzen on the top of the liquid unlike with bottom fermenting lager yeast saccharomyces pastorianus where the yeast falls to the bottom of the brewing vessel cell aggregation occurs throughout microbiology in bacteria filamentous algae fungi and yeast yeast are capable of forming three aggregates mating aggregates for dna exchange chain formation and flocs as a survival strategy in adverse conditions industrial brewing strains rarely mate therefore only chain formation and flocculation are of relevance to the brewing industry yeast flocculation is distinct from agglomeration grit formation which is irreversible and occurs most commonly in baker s yeast when strains fail to separate when resuspended agglomeration only occurs following the pressing and rehydration of yeast cakes and both flocculent and non flocculent yeast strains have been shown to demonstrate agglomeration it is also distinct from the formation of biofilms which occur on a solid substrate louis pasteur is erroneously credited with first describing flocculation of brewer s yeast brewer s yeast flocculation has been the subject of many reviews flocculation has been defined as the reversible non sexual aggregation of yeast cells that may be dispersed

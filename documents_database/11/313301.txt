they form white water rapids for two to five days either side of the spring tides the falls of lora are generated when the water level in the firth of lorn i e the open sea drops below the level of the water in loch etive as the tide goes out as the seawater in loch etive pours out through the narrow mouth of the loch it passes over a rocky shelf which causes the rapids to form as the tide rises again there is a period of slack water when the levels are the same on either side however due to the narrow entrance to the loch the tide rises more quickly than the water can flow into the loch thus there is still considerable turbulence at high tide caused by flow into the loch thus unlike most situations where slack water is at high and low tides in the case of the falls of lora slack water occurs when the levels on either side are the same not when the tidal change is at its least as a result the tidal range is much greater on the coast than it is inside the loch a range at oban

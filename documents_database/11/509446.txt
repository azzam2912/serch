empirical modelling with the initial letters capitalised and often abbreviated to em refers to a specific variety of empirical modelling in which models are constructed following particular principles though the extent to which these principles can be applied to model building without computers is an interesting issue to be revisited below there are at least two good reasons to consider empirical modelling in the first instance as computer based without doubt new technologies that are based on computers have had a transformative impact where the full exploitation of empirical modelling principles is concerned what is more the conception of empirical modelling has been closely associated with thinking about the role of the computer in model building an empirical model operates on a simple semantic principle the maker observes a close correspondence between the behaviour of the model and that of its referent the crafting of this correspondence can be empirical in a wide variety of senses it may entail a trial and error process may be based on computational approximation to analytic formulae it may be derived as a black box relation that affords no insight into why it works empirical modelling is rooted on the key principle of william

the workpieces melt and flow together as the kinetic energy of the electrons is transformed into heat upon impact ebw is often performed under vacuum conditions to prevent dissipation of the electron beam electron beam welding was developed by the german physicist karl heinz steigerwald in 1949 who was at the time working on various electron beam applications steigerwald conceived and developed the first practical electron beam welding machine which began operation in 1958 american inventor james t russell has also been credited with designing and building the first electron beam welder electrons are elementary particles possessing a mass m 9 1 10 kg and a negative electrical charge e 1 6 10 c they exist either bound to an atomic nucleus as conduction electrons in the atomic lattice of metals or as free electrons in vacuum free electrons in vacuum can be accelerated with their paths controlled by electric and magnetic fields in this way narrow beams of electrons carrying high kinetic energy can be formed which upon collision with atoms in solids transform their kinetic energy into heat electron beam welding provides excellent welding conditions because it involves the effectiveness of the electron beam depends on many factors

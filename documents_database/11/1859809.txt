it is an ionic crystalline solid which is colorless and odorless cadmium tetrafluoroborate is most frequently used in the industrial production of high strength steels its purpose being to prevent hydrogen absorption a source of post production cracking of the metal in the treated steels another application of the chemistry of cadmium tetrafluoroborate is fine tuning of the size of cadmium telluride nanomaterials while the use of cadmium tetrafluoroborate is limited concerns about limited or chronic exposure to this substance should be brought to the attention of a physician or other trained medical staff exposure to cadmium tetrafluoroborate via ingestion contact with the skin or mucous membranes or inhalation can have lasting and harmful health effects cadmium tetrafluoroborate may be prepared from the reaction between an aqueous solution of fluoroboric acid and cadmium carbonate or cadmium oxide it is also possible to prepare cadmium tetrafluoroborate through an oxidation reduction reaction implementing nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate cadmium tetrafluoroborate is an ionic compound formed from the two ionic species cd and bf at room temperature it forms colorless odorless crystals which are soluble in polar solvents such as water or ethanol at room temperature the hydrated salt cd bf 6ho exists in a monoclinic

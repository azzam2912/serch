the method was first proposed in the 1950s by louis landweber and it can be now viewed as a special case of many other more general methods the original landweber algorithm attempts to recover a signal x from noisy measurements y the linear version assumes that formula 1 for a linear operator a when the problem is in finite dimensions a is just a matrix when a is nonsingular then an explicit solution is formula 2 however if a is ill conditioned the explicit solution is a poor choice since it is sensitive to any noise in the data y if a is singular this explicit solution doesn t even exist the landweber algorithm is an attempt to regularize the problem and is one of the alternatives to tikhonov regularization we may view the landweber algorithm as solving using an iterative method the algorithm is given by the update where the relaxation factor formula 5 satisfies formula 6 here formula 7 is the largest singular value of formula 8 if we write formula 9 then the update can be written in terms of the gradient and hence the algorithm is a special case of gradient descent for ill posed problems

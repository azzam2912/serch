the substrate is made of many carbon granules each of which is itself highly porous as a result the substrate has a large surface area within which contaminants can be trapped activated carbon is typically used in filters as it has been treated to have a much higher surface area than non treated carbon one pound of activated carbon has a surface area in excess of 3 000 m 32 000 sq ft carbon filtering is commonly used for water purification air filtering and industrial gas processing for example the removal of siloxanes and hydrogen sulfide from biogas it is also used in a number of other applications including respirator masks the purification of sugarcane and in the recovery of precious metals especially gold it is also used in cigarette filters and in the evap used in cars when filtering water charcoal carbon filters are most effective at removing chlorine particles such as sediment volatile organic compounds vocs taste and odor they are not effective at removing minerals salts and dissolved inorganic substances each carbon filter is typically given a micron rating that specifies the size of particle which the filter can remove from a fluid typical particle sizes which

an understanding of electromagnetism is important for practical applications like electrical engineering and chemistry in addition concepts taught in courses on electromagnetism provide a basis for more advanced material in physics such as quantum field theory and general relativity this article focuses on a conceptual understanding of the topics rather than the details of the mathematics involved electric charge is a quantity used to determine how a particle will behave in an electric field there are three possible types of charge positive negative and neutral however the distinction between positive and negative is by convention only electric charge is quantized in units of the elementary charge formula 1 where a proton has a charge of formula 2 and an electron has a charge of formula 3 the si unit of charge is the coulomb the elementary charge formula 1 was first measured by robert millikan in his oil drop experiment in which the electric force on the particle is set to exactly counter the gravitational force that pulls it down and the terminal velocity of this particle can be used to calculate its charge a neutron has no electric charge charge conservation states that the overall electric charge in a

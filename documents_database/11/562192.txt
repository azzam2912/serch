aps is especially well suited to environments where simpler planning methods cannot adequately address complex trade offs between competing priorities production scheduling is intrinsically very difficult due to the approximately factorial dependence of the size of the solution space on the number of items products to be manufactured traditional production planning and scheduling systems such as manufacturing resource planning use a stepwise procedure to allocate material and production capacity this approach is simple but cumbersome and does not readily adapt to changes in demand resource capacity or material availability materials and capacity are planned separately and many systems do not consider material or capacity constraints leading to infeasible plans however attempts to change to the new system have not always been successful which has called for the combination of management philosophy with manufacturing unlike previous systems aps simultaneously plans and schedules production based on available materials labor and plant capacity aps has commonly been applied where one or more of the following conditions are present advanced planning scheduling software enables manufacturing scheduling and advanced scheduling optimization within these environments

the driving force that causes metals to corrode is a consequence of their temporary existence in metallic form in order to produce metals starting from naturally occurring minerals and ores it is necessary to provide a certain amount of energy e g iron ore in a blast furnace it is therefore thermodynamically inevitable that these metals when exposed to various environments would revert to their state found in nature corrosion and corrosion engineering thus involves a study of chemical kinetics thermodynamics and electrochemistry generally related to metallurgy or materials science corrosion engineering also relates to non metallics including ceramics cement composite material and conductive materials such as carbon graphite corrosion engineers often manage other not strictly corrosion processes including but not restricted to cracking brittle fracture crazing fretting erosion and more typically categorized as infrastructure asset management in the 1990s imperial college london even offered a master of science degree entitled the corrosion of engineering materials umist university of manchester institute of science and technology and now part of the university of manchester also offered a similar course corrosion engineering master s degree courses are available worldwide and the curricula contains study material about the control and understanding of corrosion

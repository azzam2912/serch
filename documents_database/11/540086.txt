the project has been developed by the irish national grid operator eirgrid the interconnector is aimed to increase competition and security of supply and better use the capacity of wind energy the additional capacity headroom provided by the interconnection will assist in reducing the electricity supply board s dominant position in the irish electricity market by joining the two markets it will allow irish suppliers to access power in the british market and for britain based suppliers to enter the irish market without initially having to commit to large capital expenditure significantly reducing barriers to entry irish renewable generators will benefit from the interconnection as it will increase their available market and may make it more economically attractive to construct more large scale renewable generation esb power generation announced in 2007 its intention to withdraw approximately 1 300 mw of capacity by 2010 this would effectively reduce the installed capacity of fully dispatchable plant from 6 437 mw to 5 150 mw this closure of older inefficient power plants such as a 461 mw fossil fuel capacity at poolbeg generating station dublin and coupled with the high growth demand forecasts presented created a major threat to the security of the

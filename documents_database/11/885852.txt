the twisting can occur around the long axis of the stomach this is called organoaxial or around the axis perpendicular to this called mesenteroaxial obstruction is more likely in organoaxial twisting than with mesenteroaxial while the latter is more associated with ischemia about one third of the cases are associated with a hiatus hernia treatment is surgical the classic triad borchardt s triad of gastric volvulus described by borchardt in 1904 consists of severe epigastric pain retching due to sour taste in mouth without vomiting inability to pass a nasogastric tube and reportedly occurs in 70 of cases sometimes severe pain at the top of left shoulder this may be due to internal bleeding irritating the diaphragm upon respiration in an organoaxial gastric volvulus the stomach rotates around an axis that connects the gastroesophageal junction and the pylorus the antrum rotates in opposite direction to the fundus of the stomach this is the most common type of gastric volvulus occurring in approximately 59 of cases and it is usually associated with diaphragmatic defects strangulation and necrosis commonly occur with organoaxial gastric volvulus and have been reported in 5 28 of cases the key imaging feature of organoaxial volvulus is that

given that quantum mechanics is non local i e that quantum mechanical correlations violate bell inequalities a natural question to ask is how non local can quantum mechanics be or more precisely by how much can the bell inequality be violated the answer is precisely the tsirelson bound for the particular bell inequality in question in general this bound is lower than what would be algebraically possible and much research has been dedicated to the question of why this is the case the tsirelson bounds are named after boris s tsirelson or cirel son in a different transliteration the author of the paper in which the first one was derived the first tsirelson bound was derived as an upper bound on the correlations measured in the chsh inequality it states that if we have four hermitian dichotomic observables formula 1 formula 2 formula 3 formula 4 i e two observables for alice and two for bob with outcomes formula 5 such that formula 6 for all formula 7 then for comparison in the classical or local realistic case the upper bound is 2 whereas if any arbitrary assignment of formula 5 is allowed it is 4 the tsirelson bound is

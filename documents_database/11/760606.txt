the dish is peppered with small single stranded dna molecules or chains that stick up into the air these are known as capture probe dna molecules next an extender dna molecule is added each extender has two domains one that hybridizes to the capture dna molecule and one that hangs out in the air the purpose of the extender is two fold first it creates more available surface area for target dna molecules to bind and second it allows the assay to be easily adapted to detect a variety of target dna molecules once the capture and extender molecules are in place and they have hybridized the sample can be added target molecules in the sample will bind to the extender molecule this results in a base peppered with capture probes which are hybridized to extender probes which in turn are hybridized to target molecules at this point signal amplification takes place a label extender dna molecule is added that has two domains similar to the first extender the label extender hybridizes to the target and to a pre amplified molecule the preamplifier molecule has two domains first it binds to the label extender and second it binds to the

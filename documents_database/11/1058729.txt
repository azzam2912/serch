the serotype is determined by the antibody recognition of subset of dq chains the chain of dq is encoded by hla dqb1 locus and dq2 are encoded by the hla dqb1 allele group this group currently contains two common alleles dqb1 and dqb1 hla dq2 and hla dqb1 02 are almost synonymous in meaning dq2 chains combine with chains encoded by genetically linked hla dqa1 alleles to form the cis haplotype isoforms these isoforms nicknamed dq2 2 and dq2 5 are also encoded by the dqa1 and dqa1 genes respectively dq2 is most common in western europe north africa and east africa highest frequencies are observed in parts of spain and ireland this distribution correlates with the frequency of two of the most prevalent autoimmune diseases there is also an increase in dqb1 in central asia peaking in kazakhstan and declining slowly west to east into china and finally southeast asia dqa1 dqb1 dq2 5 is one of the most predisposing factors for autoimmune disease dq2 5 is encoded often by a haplotype associated with a large number of diseases this haplotype hla a1 b8 dr3 dq2 is associated with diseases in which hla dq2 has suspect involvement direct involvement

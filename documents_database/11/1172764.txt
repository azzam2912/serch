the default blend mode in most applications is simply to hide the lower layer by covering it with whatever is present in the top layer however as each pixel has a numerical representation there exist a large number of ways to blend two layers the top layer is not necessarily a layer in the application it may be applied with a painting or editing tool the top layer can also be referred to as the blend layer or active layer most graphics editing programs like adobe photoshop and gimp allow the user to modify the basic blend modes e g by applying different levels of opacity to the top layer in the formulas shown on this page values go from 0 0 black to 1 0 white this is the standard blend mode which uses the top layer alone without mixing its colors with the layer beneath it where a is the value of a color channel in the underlying layer and b is that of the corresponding channel of the upper layer the result is most typically merged into the bottom layer using simple b over a alpha compositing making the actual formula formula 2 but other porter duff

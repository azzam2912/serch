on a smaller scale coplanar waveguide transmission lines are also built into monolithic microwave integrated circuits conventional coplanar waveguide cpw consists of a single conducting track printed onto a dielectric substrate together with a pair of return conductors one to either side of the track all three conductors are on the same side of the substrate and hence are coplanar the return conductors are separated from the central track by a small gap which has an unvarying width along the length of the line away from the central conductor the return conductors usually extend to an indefinite but large distance so that each is notionally a semi infinite plane conductor backed coplanar waveguide cbcpw is a common variant which has a ground plane covering the entire back face of the substrate the ground plane serves as a third return conductor coplanar waveguide was invented in 1969 by cheng p wen primarily as a means by which non reciprocal components such as gyrators and isolators could be incorporated in planar transmission line circuits the electromagnetic wave carried by a coplanar waveguide exists partly in the dielectric substrate and partly in the air above it in general the dielectric constant of the

the specification s details are proprietary to mipi member organizations but a substantial body of knowledge can be assembled from open sources a number of industry standard settings bodies have incorporated m phy into their specifications including mobile pci express universal flash storage and as the physical layer for superspeed inter chip usb m phy is generally transmitted using low voltage differential signaling similar to but not lvds over impedance controlled traces between two components within one circuit card or over a short flexible flat cable however m phy was designed to support optical media converters allowing extended distance between transmitters and receivers and reducing concerns with electromagnetic interference m phy like its predecessor d phy is intended to be used in high speed point to point communications for example video camera serial interfaces the csi 2 interface was based on d phy or c phy while the newer csi 3 interface is based on m phy m phy was designed to supplant d phy in many applications but this is expected to take a number of years the m phy the physical layer is also used in a number of different high speed emergent industry standards digrf high speed

as an electron moves past atoms in the lattice its charge distorts or polarizes the nearby lattice this effect leads to a decrease in the electron or hole as may be the case mobility which results in a decreased conductivity however as the magnitude of the seebeck coefficient increases with phonon drag it may be beneficial in a thermoelectric material for direct energy conversion applications the magnitude of this effect is typically appreciable only at low temperatures debye temperature at lower temperatures there are fewer phonons available for drag and at higher temperatures they tend to lose momentum in phonon phonon scattering instead of phonon electron scattering this region of the seebeck coefficient versus temperature function is highly variable under a magnetic field kittel charles 1996 introduction to solid state physics 7th ed john wiley and sons inc

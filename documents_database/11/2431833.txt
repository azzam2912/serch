it consists of a series of interconnected rifts that formed during the paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic eras extensional stresses along the entire length of the rift system have resulted in a variety of tectonic features including grabens half grabens basins and faults development of the canadian arctic rift system was accompanied by two plate tectonic episodes that originated on opposite sides of the north american plate and were propagated toward each other both were strongly controlled by pre existing structures which either guided the propagating faults or impeded their growth the rift system is now inactive apart from minor adjustments that are indicated by occasional earthquakes in baffin bay and the labrador sea the canadian arctic rift system is a branch of the mid atlantic ridge that extends into the north american continent it is an incipient structure that diminishes in degree of development northwestward bifurcates at the head of baffin bay and disappears into the arctic archipelago the rift system is mainly an extensional structure which has allowed greenland and canada to rotate apart and form intervening seaways the segment extending from the labrador sea to baffin bay is sometimes referred to as the labrador sea baffin bay rift

marc tremblay was the chief architect introduced in 1997 it was further development of the ultrasparc operating at higher clock frequencies of 250 mhz eventually reaching 650 mhz the die contained 5 4 million transistors and had an area of 149 mm it was fabricated by texas instruments in their 0 35 m process dissipated 25 w at 205 mhz and used a 2 5 v power supply l2 cache capacity was 1 to 4 mb in 1999 the ultrasparc ii was ported to a 0 25 m process this version was code named sapphire black it operated at 360 to 480 mhz possessed a die area of 126 mm dissipated 21 w at 400 mhz and the power supply voltage was reduced to 1 9 v supported l2 cache capacity was increased to 1 to 8 mb the ultrasparc ii was the basis for four derivatives the ultrasparc iie hummingbird was an embedded version introduced in 2000 that operated at 400 to 500 mhz fabricated in a 0 18 m process with aluminium interconnects it dissipated a maximum of 13 w at 500 mhz used a 1 5 to 1 7 v power supply and had a 256 kb

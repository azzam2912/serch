if we want this to be a set restrict to boolean algebras of set theoretical rank below the one of b the class of isomorphism types of boolean algebras endowed with the addition defined by formula 1 for any boolean algebras x and y where formula 2 denotes the isomorphism type of x is a conical refinement monoid for a boolean algebra a and a commutative monoid m a map a m is a measure if a 0 if and only if a 0 and a b a b whenever a and b are disjoint that is a b 0 for any a b in a we say in addition that is a vaught measure after robert lawson vaught or v measure if for all c in a and all x y in m such that c x y there are disjoint a b in a such that c a b a x and b y an element e in a commutative monoid m is measurable with respect to m if there are a boolean algebra a and a v measure a m such that 1 e we say that measures e we say that m is measurable if any

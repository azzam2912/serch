it is typically coloured red or green to distinguish it from motor oil and other fluids in the vehicle the fluid is optimized for the special requirements of a transmission such as valve operation brake band friction and the torque converter as well as gear lubrication atf is also used as a hydraulic fluid in some power assisted steering systems as a lubricant in some 4wd transfer cases and in some modern manual transmissions modern atf consists of a base oil plus an additive package containing a wide variety of chemical compounds intended to provide the required properties of a particular atf specification most atfs contain some combination of additives that improve lubricating qualities such as anti wear additives rust and corrosion inhibitors detergents dispersants and surfactants which protect and clean metal surfaces kinematic viscosity and viscosity index improvers and modifiers seal swell additives and agents which extend the rotational speed range and temperature range of the additives application anti foam additives and anti oxidation compounds to inhibit oxidation and boil off which extends the life of the additives application cold flow improvers high temperature thickeners gasket conditioners pour point depressant and petroleum dye all atfs contain friction modifiers except

it is defined as a b where a is the number of partitions of data implied by the first tree but not the second tree and b is the number of partitions of data implied by the second tree but not the first tree the partitions are calculated for each tree by removing each branch thus the number of eligible partitions for each tree is equal to the number of branches in that tree the robinson foulds metric is also known as the symmetric difference metric given two unrooted trees of nodes and a set of labels i e taxa for each node which could be empty but only nodes with degree greater than or equal to three can be labeled by an empty set the robinson foulds metric finds the number of formula 1 and formula 2 operations to convert one into the other the number of operations defines their distance the authors define two trees to be the same if they are isomorphic and the isomorphism preserves the labeling the construction of the proof is based on a function called formula 1 which contracts an edge combining the nodes creating a union of their sets conversely formula 2

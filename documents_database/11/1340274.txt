the rhodophyta also comprises one of the largest phyla of algae containing over 7 000 currently recognized species with taxonomic revisions ongoing the majority of species 6 793 are found in the florideophyceae class and mostly consist of multicellular marine algae including many notable seaweeds approximately 5 of the red algae occur in freshwater environments with greater concentrations found in warmer areas except for two coastal cave dwelling species in the asexual class cyanidiophyceae that diverged from other red algae about 1 3 billion years ago there are no terrestrial species which may be due to an evolutionary bottleneck where the last common ancestor lost about 25 of its core genes and much of its evolutionary plasticity the red algae form a distinct group characterized by having eukaryotic cells without flagella and centrioles chloroplasts that lack external endoplasmic reticulum and contain unstacked stroma thylakoids and use phycobiliproteins as accessory pigments which give them their red color red algae store sugars as floridean starch which is a type of starch that consists of highly branched amylopectin without amylose as food reserves outside their plastids most red algae are also multicellular macroscopic marine and reproduce sexually the red algal life history is

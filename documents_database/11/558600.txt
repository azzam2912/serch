this solid is a semiconductor material with a direct band gap of 2 26 ev it is usually a p type semiconductor its crystal structure is cubic like that for sphalerite and diamond znte has the appearance of grey or brownish red powder or ruby red crystals when refined by sublimation zinc telluride typically had a cubic sphalerite or zincblende crystal structure but can be also prepared as rocksalt crystals or in hexagonal crystals wurtzite structure irradiated by a strong optical beam burns in presence of oxygen its lattice constant is 0 6101 nm allowing it to be grown with or on aluminium antimonide gallium antimonide indium arsenide and lead selenide with some lattice mismatch it can also be grown on other substrates such as gaas and it can be grown in thin film polycrystalline or nanocrystalline form on substrates such as glass for example in the manufacture of thin film solar cells in the wurtzite hexagonal crystal structure it has lattice parameters a 0 427 and c 0 699 nm zinc telluride can be easily doped and for this reason it is one of the more common semiconducting materials used in optoelectronics znte is important for development of various

this includes respiration of plant roots the rhizosphere microbes and fauna soil respiration is a key ecosystem process that releases carbon from the soil in the form of co co is acquired from the atmosphere and converted into organic compounds in the process of photosynthesis plants use these organic compounds to build structural components or respire them to release energy when plant respiration occurs below ground in the roots it adds to soil respiration over time plant structural components are consumed by heterotrophs this heterotrophic consumption releases co and when this co is released by below ground organisms it is considered soil respiration the amount of soil respiration that occurs in an ecosystem is controlled by several factors the temperature moisture nutrient content and level of oxygen in the soil can produce extremely disparate rates of respiration these rates of respiration can be measured in a variety of methods other methods can be used to separate the source components in this case the type of photosynthetic pathway c3 c4 of the respired plant structures soil respiration rates can be largely affected by human activity this is because humans have the ability to and have been changing the various controlling factors

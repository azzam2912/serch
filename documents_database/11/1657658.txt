it is a probable u geminorum type dwarf nova and outbursts have been observed in 1948 and 2011 it is also listed in the general catalogue of variable stars as v1024 persei v1024 persei was initially named as ross 4 in 1925 on the basis of photographic plates showing that it was much brighter in 1904 than in 1925 another outburst was observed in november 1948 a small outburst occurred on march 9 10 2011 when it briefly reached about visual magnitude 14 5 a brighter outburst phase began and was observed on march 28 2011 at visual magnitude 13 49 and confirmed at visual magnitude 12 8 on march 30 2011 the object is typically fainter than visual magnitude 16 in 2015 it was formally given the variable star designation v1024 persei the modest outburst amplitude and an increase in x ray brightness as the optical brightness declines suggest that this object is a dwarf nova rather than a recurrent nova a relationship between decline rates and the orbital periods of dwarf novae suggest that the period is less than two hours that would mean that it could be a wz sagittae type of dwarf nova but the lack

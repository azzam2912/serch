it uses artificial neural network machine learning methods in its algorithm it is a server side program featuring a website serving as a front end interface which can predict a protein s secondary structure beta sheets alpha helixes and coils from the primary sequence psipred is available as a web service and as software the software is distributed as source code licensed technically as proprietary software it allows modifying but enforces freeware provisions by forbidding for profit distribution of the software and its results secondary structure is the general three dimensional form of local segments of biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids dna rna it does not however describe specific atomic positions in three dimensional space which are considered to be the tertiary structure secondary structure can be formally defined by the hydrogen bonds of the biopolymer as observed in an atomic resolution structure in proteins the secondary structure is defined by the patterns of hydrogen bond between backbone amino and carboxyl groups conversely for nucleic acids the secondary structure consists of the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases the hydrogen bonding patterns may be significantly distorted which makes automatic determination of secondary structure difficult efforts to use computers

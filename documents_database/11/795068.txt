pioneered by b w batterman in the 1960s the availability of synchrotron light has stimulated the application of this interferometric technique to a wide range of problems in surface science an x ray standing wave xsw field is created by interference between an x ray beam impinging on a sample and a reflected beam the reflection may be generated at the bragg condition for a crystal lattice or an engineered multilayer superlattice in these cases the period of the xsw equals the periodicity of the reflecting planes x ray reflectivity from a mirror surface at small incidence angles may also be used to generate long period xsws the spatial modulation of the xsw field described by the dynamical theory of x ray diffraction undergoes a pronounced change when the sample is scanned through the bragg condition due to a relative phase variation between the incoming and reflected beams the nodal planes of the xsw field shift by half the xsw period depending on the position of the atoms within this wave field the measured element specific absorption of x rays varies in a characteristic way therefore measurement of the absorption via x ray fluorescence or photoelectron yield can reveal the

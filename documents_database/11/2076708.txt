it can also be used to describe the ability of an ecosystem specifically the environment and its living population to recover from damage resilience to minor disturbances is one characteristic feature of healthy ecosystems following major lethal disturbances such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest an immediate return to the previous dynamic equilibrium will not be possible instead pioneering species will occupy compete for space and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat the new growth of seedlings and community assembly process is known as regeneration in ecology as ecological succession sets in a forest will slowly regenerate towards its former state within the succession climax or any intermediate stage provided that all outer parameters climate soil fertility availability of nutrients animal migration paths air pollution or the absence thereof etc remain unchanged in certain regions like australia natural wildfire is a necessary condition for a cyclically stable ecosystem with cyclic regeneration while natural disturbances are usually fully compensated by the rules of ecological succession human interference can significantly alter the regenerative homeostatic faculties of an ecosystem up to a degree that self healing will not be possible for regeneration to occur active restoration must be attempted

in both types the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the anode by the electric field in the tube the simplest vacuum tube the diode invented in 1904 by john ambrose fleming contains only a heated electron emitting cathode and an anode electrons can only flow in one direction through the device from the cathode to the anode adding one or more control grids within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grid or grids these devices became a key component of electronic circuits for the first half of the twentieth century they were crucial to the development of radio television radar sound recording and reproduction long distance telephone networks and analogue and early digital computers although some applications had used earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter for radio or mechanical computers for computing it was the invention of the thermionic vacuum tube that made these technologies widespread and practical and created the discipline of electronics in the 1940s the invention of semiconductor devices made it possible to produce solid state devices which are smaller more efficient reliable and durable and cheaper than thermionic tubes from

she is the erastus o haven professor of life sciences and chair of the department of molecular biosciences labonne received her bachelor degree from the university of rochester in 1989 doing research with dr sayeeda zain on the molecular basis of alzheimer s disease inspired by the work of famed embryologist and rochester emeritus professor johannes holtfreter labonne pursued doctoral work at harvard university studying germ layer formation using xenopus as a model as a national science foundation pre doctoral fellow working with malcolm whitman labonne characterized the role of fgf signaling in formation of the mesendoderm during her doctoral career labonne discovered that activin mediated mesoderm induction required fgf signaling and elucidated the role of ras map kinase signaling in this process following her graduate work labonne pursued post doctoral work at the california institute of technology as an american cancer society fellow working with marianne bronner on the molecular mechanisms underlying the early development of neural crest cells she showed that formation of neural crest cells a stem cell population unique to vertebrates required both attenuation of endogenous bmp signaling and active wnt signaling and further showed that up regulation of the zinc finger transcriptional repressor snai2 could

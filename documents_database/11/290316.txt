like the later cartouche it contained a royal name a serekh was an ornamental vignette combining a view of a palace facade and a plan top view of the royal courtyard the word serekh derives from the egyptian word for facade different serekhs on different types of object display countless variations of the facade decor in its complexity and detail it seems that no strict artistic rules for the design of the serekh itself existed a serekh was normally used as a royal crest accentuating and honouring the name of the pharaoh its use can be dated back as early as the gerzeh culture ca 3400 bc the hieroglyphs forming the king s name were placed inside a rectangular extension atop the serekh which represented the royal courtyard additionally the falcon of the god horus or in a few cases the set animal topped the serekh showing the celestial patron of the named king if the word serekh was written in full letters as shown in the infobox above sometimes accompanied by a miniature of the serekh it could also be used in text as already mentioned the serekh first appears as an ornamental miniature during the late gerzeh culture

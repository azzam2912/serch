the most common labeling convention the npk or n p k label shows the amounts of the chemical elements nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are usually labeled with three numbers as in 18 20 10 indicating the relative content of the macronutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k respectively more precisely the first number n value is the percentage of elemental nitrogen by weight in the fertilizer that is the mass fraction of nitrogen times 100 the second number p value is the percentage by weight of phosphorus pentoxide in a fertilizer with the same amount of phosphorus that gets all of its phosphorus from po the third number k value is analogous based on the equivalent content of potassium oxide for example a 15 13 20 fertilizer would contain 15 by weight of nitrogen and the same amounts of phosphorus and potassium as a mixture of 13 by weight of 20 and 67 of some inert ingredient in the u k fertilizer labeling regulations allow for reporting the elemental mass fractions of phosphorus and potassium the regulations stipulate that this should be done in parentheses after the standard n p k values as in 15 30 15 15

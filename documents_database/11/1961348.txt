this air leakage is driven by differential pressures across the building envelope due to the combined effects of stack external wind and mechanical ventilation systems airtightness is the fundamental building property that impacts infiltration and exfiltration the uncontrolled inward and outward leakage of outdoor air through cracks interstices or other unintentional openings of a building caused by pressure effects of the wind and or stack effect an airtight building has several positive impacts when combined with an appropriate ventilation system whether natural mechanical or hybrid a number of studies have shown substantial energy savings by tightening building envelopes the asiepi project technical report on building and ductwork airtightness estimates the energy impact of envelope airtightness in the order of 10 kwh per m of floor area per year for the heating needs in a moderately cold region 2500 degree days experimental data showing the energy savings of good airtightness were also published by the building research establishment in the uk as well as rehva journals special issue on airtightness they conclude 15 of the space conditioning energy use can be saved in the uk context going from 11 5 m m h 50 pa average current value down to 5

the concept is the counterpart of the woodward hoffmann approach the methodology in this treatment utilizes the plus minus sign parity in proceeding around a cycle of orbitals in a molecule or reaction while the woodward hoffmann methodology uses a large number of rules with the same consequences one year following the woodward hoffmann and longuet higgins abrahmson publications it was noted by zimmerman that both transition states and stable molecules sometimes involved a m bius array of basis orbitals the m bius h ckel treatment provides an alternative to the woodward hoffmann one in contrast to the woodward hoffmann approach the m bius h ckel treatment is not dependent on symmetry and only requires counting the number of plus minus sign inversions in proceeding around the cyclic array of orbitals where one has zero or an even number of sign inversions there is a h ckel array where an odd number of sign inversions is found a m bius array is determined to be present thus the approach goes beyond the geometric consideration of edgar heilbronner in any case symmetry may be present or may not edgar heilbronner had described twisted annulenes which had m bius topology but in

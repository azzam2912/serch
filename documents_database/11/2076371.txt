this hybrid of quicksort and radix sort was originally suggested by p shackleton as reported in one of c a r hoare s seminal papers on quicksort its modern incarnation was developed by jon bentley and robert sedgewick in the mid 1990s the algorithm is designed to exploit the property that in many problems strings tend to have shared prefixes one of the algorithm s uses is the construction of suffix arrays for which it was one of the fastest algorithms as of 2004 the three way radix quicksort algorithm sorts an array of pointers to strings in lexicographic order it is assumed that all strings are of equal length if the strings are of varying length they must be padded with extra elements that are less than any element in the strings the pseudocode for the algorithm is then the function must return a single character bentley and sedgewick suggest either picking the median of or some random character in that range the partition function is a variant of the one used in ordinary three way quicksort it rearranges so that all of have an element at position that is less than have at position and strings from onward

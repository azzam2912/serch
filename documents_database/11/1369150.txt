to slew means to turn without change of place compared to other rolling element bearings slewing bearings are thin in section and are often made in diameters of a metre or more the slewing bearings on the falkirk wheel are 4 metres diameter and fit over a 3 5 metre axle slewing bearings often use two rows of rolling elements they often use three race elements such as an inner ring and two outer ring halves that clamp together axially slewing bearings are often made with gear teeth integral with the inner or outer race used to drive the platform relative to the base as for other bearings that reciprocate rather than rotating continuously lubrication can be difficult the oil wedge built up in a continuously rotating bearing is disrupted by the stop start motion of slewing instead a hydrostatic bearing with pumped oil flow may be used the american society of mechanical engineers asme publishes the following standard

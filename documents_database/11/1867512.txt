the name explicit reciprocity law refers to the fact that the hilbert symbols of local fields appear in hilbert s reciprocity law for the power residue symbol the definitions of the hilbert symbol are usually rather roundabout and can be hard to use directly in explicit examples and the explicit reciprocity laws give more explicit expressions for the hilbert symbol that are sometimes easier to use there are also several explicit reciprocity laws for various generalizations of the hilbert symbol to higher local fields p divisible groups and so on gave an explicit formula for the hilbert symbol in the case of odd prime powers for some special values of and when the field is the cyclotomic extension of the p adic numbers by a p th root of unity extended the formula of artin and hasse to more cases of and and and extended iwasawa s work to lubin tate extensions of local fields for archimedean local fields or in the unramified case the hilbert symbol is easy to write down explicitly the main problem is to evaluate it in the ramified case over the complex numbers a b is always 1 over the reals the hilbert symbol of

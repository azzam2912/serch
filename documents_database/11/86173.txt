such a division can be formally expressed as where a is the dividend numerator in ordinary arithmetic the expression has no meaning as there is no number which when multiplied by 0 gives a assuming a 0 and so division by zero is undefined since any number multiplied by zero is zero the expression is also undefined when it is the form of a limit it is an indeterminate form historically one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to is contained in george berkeley s criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in the analyst ghosts of departed quantities there are mathematical structures in which is defined for some a such as in the riemann sphere and the projectively extended real line however such structures cannot satisfy every ordinary rule of arithmetic the field axioms in computing a program error may result from an attempt to divide by zero depending on the programming environment and the type of number e g floating point integer being divided by zero it may generate positive or negative infinity by the ieee 754 floating point standard generate an exception generate an error message cause the program to terminate

coherent sampling refers to a certain relationship between input frequency formula 1 sampling frequency formula 2 number of cycles in the sampled set formula 3 and number of samples formula 4 with coherent sampling one is assured that the signal power in an fft is contained within one fft bin assuming single input frequency the condition for coherent sampling is given by where formula 4 value must be a power of 2 and formula 3 value must be an odd or prime number if we have formula 8 and formula 9 and we want an input frequency close to formula 10 let s say formula 11 then formula 12 which is close to an integer so we could round it down to formula 13 and we would get formula 14 this is an input frequency that satisfies coherent sampling and makes sure that we get an integer number of cycles this integer number formula 15 can be chosen to be a prime number except for 2 this ensures that the same fft samples will not be repeated across any input signal cycles of the sampled signal for example if n 32 and m 6 non prime then there will be

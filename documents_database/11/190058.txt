they are found ubiquitously in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes serine proteases fall into two broad categories based on their structure chymotrypsin like trypsin like or subtilisin like in humans they are responsible for coordinating various physiological functions including digestion immune response blood coagulation and reproduction the merops protease classification system counts 16 superfamilies as of 2013 each containing many families each superfamily uses the catalytic triad or dyad in a different protein fold and so represent convergent evolution of the catalytic mechanism the majority belong to the s1 family of the pa clan superfamily of proteases for superfamilies p superfamily containing a mixture of nucleophile class families s purely serine proteases superfamily within each superfamily families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile s serine proteases families of serine proteases serine proteases are characterised by a distinctive structure consisting of two beta barrel domains that converge at the catalytic active site these enzymes can be further categorised based on their substrate specificity as either trypsin like chymotrypsin like or elastase like trypsin like proteases cleave peptide bonds following a positively charged amino acid lysine or arginine this specificity is driven by the residue which lies at the base of the enzyme

this vowel inherited from vulgar latin underwent fronting and closure in stressed open syllables when preceded by a palatal or palatalized consonant the result of this process in old french was the diphthong note that is also the outcome of the diphthongization of in stressed open syllables the chronology of bartsch s law relative to the more general diphthongization of to responsible for example for the final vowels in mer sea or porter carry has not been conclusively established according to one view diphthongization took place first and bartsch s law is seen as a further segmentation of the diphthong caused by the preceding palatal palatalized consonant followed by simplification of the resulting triphthong according to a second view bartsch s law affected the simple vowel causing it to change to which then diphthongized to support for the second hypothesis comes the fact that palatal consonants triggered the same change in unstressed word initial syllables subsequent changes have obscured the effects of bartsch s law in modern french the accent shifted to the second element of the diphthong and the first element underwent glide formation the glide was then lost in most words either absorbed by the preceding palatal consonant

first described in 2004 with the temporary name irices1 midichloria species are symbionts of the hard tick ixodes ricinus they live in the cells of the ovary of the females of this tick species these bacteria have been observed in the mitochondria of the host cells a trait that has never been described in any other symbiont of animals midichloria bacteria seem to consume the mitochondria they parasitize possibly using them as a source of energy and or molecules to multiply the interaction of these symbionts with their host is currently unknown though the 100 prevalence in the females of the host tick suggests a mutualistic association only one species midichloria mitochondrii is described in this genus molecular screenings however have detected the presence of related bacteria in other tick species as well as in other blood sucking arthropods suggesting the possibility of horizontal transmission of these bacteria it was given its own family the midichloriaceae in the rickettsiales some poorly studied candidate species belonging to this family may include nicolleia massiliensis and the unclassified montezuma strain the name of this bacterial genus midichloria is derived from the fictional midichlorians a symbiotic microscopic life form described in the star wars

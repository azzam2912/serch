jean fran ois hochedez rob is principal investigator yves stockman csl is project manager and werner schmutz pmod is lead co investigator lyra will monitor the solar irradiance in four uv passbands they have been chosen for their relevance to solar physics aeronomy and space weather the radiometric calibration of the instrument is traceable to synchrotron source standards physikalisch technische bundesanstalt ptb and national institute of standards and technology nist its stability will be monitored by onboard calibration light sources light emitting diodes which allow distinguishing between potential degradations of the detectors and filters additionally a redundancy strategy contributes to the accuracy and the stability of the measurements lyra will benefit from wide bandgap detectors based on diamond it will be the first space assessment of a pioneering uv detectors program diamond sensors make the instruments radiation hard and solar blind their high bandgap energy makes them quasi insensitive to visible light see also references in marchywka effect the swap extreme ultraviolet euv imaging telescope will operate next to lyra on proba 2 together they will establish a high performance solar monitor for operational space weather nowcasting and research lyra demonstrates technologies important for future missions such as the esa

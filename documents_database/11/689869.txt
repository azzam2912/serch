a myco heterotroph is the parasitic plant partner in this relationship myco heterotrophy is considered a kind of cheating relationship and myco heterotrophs are sometimes informally referred to as mycorrhizal cheaters this relationship is sometimes referred to as mycotrophy though this term is also used for plants that engage in mutualistic mycorrhizal relationships full or obligate myco heterotrophy exists when a non photosynthetic plant a plant largely lacking in chlorophyll or otherwise lacking a functional photosystem gets all of its food from the fungi that it parasitizes partial or facultative myco heterotrophy exists when a plant is capable of photosynthesis but parasitizes fungi as a supplementary food supply there are also plants such as some orchid species that are non photosynthetic and obligately myco heterotrophic for part of their life cycle and photosynthetic and facultatively myco heterotrophic or non myco heterotrophic for the rest of their life cycle not all non photosynthetic or plants are myco heterotrophic some non photosynthetic plants like dodder directly parasitize the vascular tissue of other plants in the past non photosynthetic plants were mistakenly thought to get food by breaking down organic matter in a manner similar to saprotrophic fungi such plants were therefore called

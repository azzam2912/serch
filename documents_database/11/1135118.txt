the swathe width depends on the blade length the nature of the crop and the mower but is usually about 1 5 metres wide mowing may be done by a team of mowers usually starting at the edges of a meadow then proceeding clockwise leaving a series of staggered swathes and finishing in the middle the mower swings the scythe steadily in long left handed arcs ending in front of the mower and depositing the cut grass neatly to the left the mower takes a small step forward and repeats the motion proceeding with a steady rhythm stopping at frequent intervals to hone the blade the correct technique has a slicing action on the grass cutting a narrow strip leaving a uniform stubble on the ground and forming a regular windrow on the left the scythe has generally been replaced by machinery such as the swather pictured or combine harvester which still leaves a swathe to its left but is very much wider than the scythe early in the introduction of machinery it was still necessary for mowers with scythes to open up a swathe wide enough to take the machine before it could start by analogy swath width also

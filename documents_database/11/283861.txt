it has an apparent visual magnitude of 10 67 which is much too faint to be seen with the naked eye however it can be viewed with even a modest telescope of aperture in 2004 the existence of an extrasolar planet gliese 436b was verified as orbiting the star this planet was later discovered to transit its host star gliese 436 is a m2 5v star which means it is a red dwarf stellar models give an estimated size of about 42 of the sun s radius the same model predicts that the outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 3 318 k giving it the orange red hue of an m type star small stars such as this generate energy at a low rate giving it only 2 5 of the sun s luminosity gliese 436 is older than the sun by several billion years and it has an abundance of heavy elements with masses greater than helium 4 equal to 48 that of the sun the projected rotation velocity is 1 0 km s and the chromosphere has a low level of magnetic activity gliese 436 is a member of the old disk population with velocity components in

plants specifically satsuma mandarin trees serve as natural hosts there is currently only one species in this genus the type species satsuma dwarf virus diseases associated with this genus include satsuma dwarf virus disease which causes spoon shaped leaves on citrus tree symptoms are enations multiple flushing stunting or dwarfing reduction in number and size of leaves and fruits the name of this genus comes from its type species satsuma dwarf virus group ssrna viruses in sadwavirus are non enveloped with icosahedral geometries and t pseudo3 symmetry the diameter is around 25 30 nm the genome is segmented into two parts of linear positive sense single stranded rna 11000 12000 nucleotides in length where one segment is about 7kb and the second segment is 4 6 to 5 4kb viral replication is cytoplasmic and is lysogenic entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell replication follows the positive stranded rna virus replication model positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription the virus exits the host cell by tubule guided viral movement plants serve as the natural host the virus is transmitted via a vector but not smov transmission routes are vector seed

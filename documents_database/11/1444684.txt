they were developed by yarrow co london shipbuilders and engineers and were widely used on ships particularly warships the yarrow boiler design is characteristic of the three drum boiler two banks of straight water tubes are arranged in a triangular row with a single furnace between them a single steam drum is mounted at the top between them with smaller water drums at the base of each bank circulation both upwards and downwards occurs within this same tube bank the yarrow s distinctive features were the use of straight tubes and also circulation in both directions taking place entirely within the tube bank rather than using external downcomers early use of the water tube boiler within the royal navy was controversial at times giving rise to the battle of the boilers around 1900 these first boilers such as the belleville and niclausse were large tube designs with simple straight tubes of around 4 diameter at a shallow angle to the horizontal these tubes were jointed into cast iron headers and gave much trouble with leakage at these joints at the time an assumption was that thermal expansion in these straight tubes was straining the joints these boilers were also large

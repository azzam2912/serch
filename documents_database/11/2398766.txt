it is located at a distance of circa 150 million light years from earth which given its apparent dimensions means that ngc 5965 is about 260 000 light years across it was discovered by william herschel on may 5 1788 two supernovae have been observed in ngc 5965 sn 2001 cm type ii mag 17 5 and sn 2018cyg type ii mag 17 0 ngc 5965 is seen nearly edge on with an inclination of 80 degrees dust is seen across the galactic disk while there is also a red dust lane at the nucleus the bulge is x shaped that suggests that the galaxy is actually barred ngc 5965 along with another edge on galaxy ngc 5746 were the galaxies used to confirm that peanut shaped bulge are associated with the presence of a bar by spectographically observing the disturbance caused at the velocity distributions of the galaxies the galaxy features some level of disk disturbance like a warp as the outer part of the disk along with a ring like dust lane appear to be on a different plane from the bulge but it could also be a projection effect when observed in k band the galaxy features

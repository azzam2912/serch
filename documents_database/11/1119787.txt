euler attributed the result to a letter now lost from goldbach goldbach s original proof to euler involved assigning a constant to the harmonic series formula 2 which is divergent such a proof is not considered rigorous by modern standards there is a strong resemblance between the method of sieving out powers employed in his proof and the method of factorization used to derive euler s product formula for the riemann zeta function let x be given by since the sum of the reciprocal of every power of two is formula 4 subtracting the terms with powers of two from x gives repeat the process with the terms with the powers of three formula 6 absent from the above sum are now all terms with powers of two and three continue by removing terms with powers of 5 6 and so on until the right side is exhausted to the value of 1 eventually we obtain the equation which we rearrange into where the denominators consist of all positive integers that are the non powers minus one by subtracting the previous equation from the definition of x given above we obtain where the denominators now consist only of perfect powers

latrotoxins are the main active components of the venom and are responsible for the symptoms of latrodectism the following latrotoxins have been described five insecticidal toxins termed and latroinsectotoxins one vertebrate specific neurotoxin alpha latrotoxin and one toxin affecting crustaceans latrocrustatoxin the best studied latrotoxin is alpha latrotoxin which acts presynaptically to release neurotransmitters including acetylcholine from sensory and motor neurons as well as on endocrine cells to release insulin for example it is a 130 kda protein that exists mainly in its dimerized or tetramerized forms latrotoxin ltx can naturally be found in widow spiders of the genus latrodectus the most widely known of those spiders are the black widows latrodectus mactans the venom of widow spiders latrodectus contains several protein toxins called latrotoxins which selectively target against either vertebrates insects or crustaceans one of these toxins is latrotoxin and targets selectively against vertebrates it is ineffective in insects and crustaceans ltx has a high affinity for receptors that are specific for neuronal and endocrine cells of vertebrates as the dna sequence for ltx is transcribed and translated an inactive precursor molecule of ltx 156 9 kda is formed this precursor molecule undergoes post translational processing where the eventual

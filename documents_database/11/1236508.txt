on a canvas of 146 square feet this painting was first exhibited at the paris salon in 1789 the subject is the roman leader lucius junius brutus founder of the roman republic contemplating the fate of his sons they had conspired to overthrow the republic and restore the monarchy and brutus himself was compelled to order their deaths in doing so brutus became the heroic defender of the republic at the cost of his own family the painting was a bold allegory of civic virtue with immense resonance for the growing cause of republicanism its themes of virtue sacrifice and devotion to the nation sparked much controversy when it was unveiled in the politically charged era of the french revolution david labored over the painting for more than two years before he considered it complete his attachment to the motif of brutus had been evident for years before this painting at least since the early 1780s when he was making the oath of the horatii 1784 this earlier work bears a distinct connection to brutus through the themes of duty loyalty and virtue the oath itself was an element of the brutus legend which david artistically transposed to the horatii

congruences are an important concept in general relativity and are also important in parts of riemannian geometry the idea of a congruence is probably better explained by giving an example than by a definition consider the smooth manifold r vector fields can be specified as first order linear partial differential operators such as these correspond to a system of first order linear ordinary differential equations in this case where dot denotes a derivative with respect to some dummy parameter the solutions of such systems are families of parameterized curves in this case this family is what is often called a congruence of curves or just congruence for short this particular example happens to have two singularities where the vector field vanishes these are fixed points of the flow a flow is a one dimensional group of diffeomorphisms a flow defines an action by the one dimensional lie group r having locally nice geometric properties these two singularities correspond to two points rather than two curves in this example the other integral curves are all simple closed curves many flows are considerably more complicated than this to avoid complications arising from the presence of singularities usually one requires the vector field

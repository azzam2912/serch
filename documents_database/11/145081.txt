it covers about 15 of mainland france subject to volcanism that has subsided in the last 10 000 years these central mountains are separated from the alps by a deep north south cleft created by the rh ne river and known in french as the sillon rhodanien literally rh ne furrow the region was a barrier to transport within france until the opening of the a75 motorway which not only made north south travel easier but also opened up the massif itself the massif central is an old massif formed during the variscan orogeny consisting mostly of granitic and metamorphic rocks it was powerfully raised and made to look geologically younger in the eastern section by the uplift of the alps during the paleogene period and in the southern section by the uplift of the pyrenees the massif thus presents a strongly asymmetrical elevation profile with highlands in the south and in the east c vennes dominating the valley of the rh ne and the plains of languedoc and by contrast the less elevated region of limousin in the northwest these tectonic movements created faults and may be the origin of the volcanism in the massif but the hypothesis is

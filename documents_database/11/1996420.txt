originally such mappings arose as group theoretic counterparts of class extension homomorphisms of abelian extensions of algebraic number fields by applying artin s reciprocity maps to ideal class groups and analyzing the resulting homomorphisms between quotients of galois groups however independently of number theoretic applications a partial order on the kernels and targets of artin transfers has recently turned out to be compatible with parent descendant relations between finite p groups with a prime number p which can be visualized in descendant trees therefore artin transfers provide a valuable tool for the classification of finite p groups and for searching and identifying particular groups in descendant trees by looking for patterns defined by the kernels and targets of artin transfers these strategies of pattern recognition are useful in purely group theoretic context as well as for applications in algebraic number theory concerning galois groups of higher p class fields and hilbert p class field towers let formula 1 be a group and formula 2 be a subgroup of finite index formula 3 definitions a left transversal of formula 4 in formula 1 is an ordered system formula 6 of representatives for the left cosets of formula 4 in formula 1

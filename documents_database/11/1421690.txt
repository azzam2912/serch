his primary field of research is mathematical analysis including hyperbolic systems of conservation laws impulsive control of lagrangian systems and non cooperative differential games bressan has contributed several important results in the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws his early work was on certain mathematical problems from the theory of combustion his research to date includes a number of key results in such diverse areas as hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and nonlinear wave equations impulsive control of lagrangian system systems of hamilton jacobi equations related to non cooperative differential games nash equilibrium solutions in feedback form for infinite horizon discounted differential games dynamic blocking problems mathematical models of wild fire confinement and optimization problems for elliptic equations bressan obtained his phd in mathematics from university of colorado under jerrold bebernes in 1982 bressan received a full professorship at the sissa in trieste italy in 1991 in 2003 he moved to penn state university to assume a full professorship there a position he still holds he won the b cher memorial prize in 2008 and the analysis of partial differential equations prize of the siam in 2007 for his work in pdes he was appointed to the eberly family chair in

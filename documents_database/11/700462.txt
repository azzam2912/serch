under conditions of high concentrations of either salts substrates or any solute in the supernatant water is drawn out of the cells through osmosis this also inhibits the transport of substrates and cofactors into the cell thus shocking the cell alternatively at low concentrations of solutes water enters the cell in large amounts causing it to swell and either burst or undergo apoptosis all organisms have mechanisms to respond to osmotic shock with sensors and signal transduction networks providing information to the cell about the osmolarity of its surroundings these signals activate responses to deal with extreme conditions although single celled organisms are more vulnerable to osmotic shock since they are directly exposed to their environment cells in large animals such as mammals still suffer these stresses under some conditions current research also suggests that osmotic stress in cells and tissues may significantly contribute to many human diseases in eukaryotes calcium acts as one of the primary regulators of osmotic stress intracellular calcium levels rise during hypo osmotic and hyper osmotic stresses extracellular sequestering of calcium by blood albumin transient intracellular ca increase intracellular ca increase and extracellular atp release calcium dependent efflux of the osmolyte taurine extracellular calcium removal

each task has an associated positive integer value its minimum repeat time the minimum time from the start of one instantiation of the task to the next only one task can be performed at any given time the desired output is an infinite sequence specifying which task to perform in each unit of time each input task should appear infinitely often in the sequence with the largest gap between two consecutive instantiations of a task at most equal to the repeat time of the task for example the infinitely repeating sequence would be a valid pinwheel schedule for three tasks a b and c with repeat times that are at least 2 4 and 4 respectively if the task to be scheduled are numbered from formula 1 to formula 2 let formula 3 denote the repeat time for task formula 4 then the density of a pinwheel scheduling problem is formula 5 for a solution to exist it is necessary that the density is at most formula 1 this condition on density is also sufficient for a schedule to exist in the special case that all repeat times are multiples of each other for instance if all are powers of

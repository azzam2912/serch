about 30 of the coating weight is cellulose in some countries paper pulp and wood powder are added to the coating in certain ratios to reduce the amount of pure cellulose the organic compounds in the coating decompose in the arc to form carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and hydrogen which increase the arc tension and thus the welding arc becomes stronger and harder compared with other types of electrodes with the same current values a 70 deeper penetration can be obtained with cellulose electrodes this type of electrode is generally produced with thin or medium coating thicknesses when the coating is thin a light amount of slag is formed on the welding beam and the spatter loss is high on the other hand the gap filling and vertical down welding capability as well as penetration of the weld obtained by this electrode is good since this electrode can be used in every position particularly in vertical down it has a wide range of applications in the ship building industry and in the welding of pipelines with a wall thickness of less than 12 5 mm the cellulose that burns during welding forms a very good protective gaseous atmosphere the main

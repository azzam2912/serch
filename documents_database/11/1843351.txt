in surface erosion the polymer degrades from the exterior surface the inside of the material does not degrade until all the surrounding material around it has been degraded in bulk erosion degradation occurs throughout the whole material equally both the surface and the inside of the material degrade surface erosion and bulk erosion are not exclusive many materials undergo a combination of surface and bulk erosion therefore surface and bulk erosion can be thought of as a spectrum instead of two separate categories in surface erosion the erosion rate is directly proportional to the surface area of the material for very thin materials the surface area remains relatively constant when the material degrades which allows surface erosion to be characterized as zero order release since the rate of degradation is constant in bulk erosion the erosion rate depends on the volume of the material due to degradation the volume of the material decreases during bulk erosion causing the erosion rate to decrease over time therefore bulk erosion rates are difficult to control since it is not zero order to determine whether a polymer will undergo surface or bulk erosion the degradation rate of the polymer in water how fast the

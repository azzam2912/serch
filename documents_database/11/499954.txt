elaters come in a variety of forms but are always associated with plant spores in many plants that do not have seeds they function in dispersing the spores to a new location mosses do not have elaters but peristome which also change shape with changes in humidity or moisture to allow for a gradual release of spores in the horsetails elaters are four ribbon like appendages attached to the spores these appendages develop from an outer spiral layer of the spore wall at maturity the four strips peel away from the inner wall except at a single point on the spore where all four strips are attached under moist conditions the elaters curl tightly around the spore the wet spores tend to stick to each other and to nearby surfaces because of surface tension when conditions are dry the spores no longer stick to each other and are more easily dispersed at that time the elaters uncoil to extend out from the spore and will catch air currents the fact that they are extended only when conditions are dry means that successful spore dispersal is more likely in the liverworts elaters are cells that develop in the sporophyte alongside the

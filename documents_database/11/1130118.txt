in higher eukaryotes 5 other n acetyltransferase nat complexes natb natf have been described that differ both in substrate specificity and subunit composition the human naa10 is located on chromosome xq28 and contains 8 exons 2 encoding three different isoforms derived from alternate splicing additionally a processed naa10 gene duplication naa11 ard2 has been identified that is expressed in several human cell lines however later studies indicate that naa11 is not expressed in the human cell lines hela and hek293 or in cancerous tissues and naa11 transcripts were only detected in testicular and placental tissues naa11 has also been found in mouse where it is mainly expressed in the testis naa11 is located on chromosome 4q21 21 in human and 5 e3 in mouse and only contains two exons in mouse naa10 is located on chromosome x a7 3 and contains 9 exons two alternative splicing products of mouse naa10 mnaa10 and mnaa10 were reported in nih 3t3 and jb6 cells that may have different activities and function in different subcellular compartments homologues for naa10 have been identified in almost all kingdoms of life analyzed including plants fungi amoebozoa archaeabacteria and protozoa in eubacteria 3 n acetyltransferases rimi rimj and

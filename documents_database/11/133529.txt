the work transfers of the system are frictionless and there is no transfer of heat or matter such an idealized process is useful in engineering as a model of and basis of comparison for real processes the word isentropic is occasionally though not customarily interpreted in another way reading it as if its meaning were deducible from its etymology this is contrary to its original and customarily used definition in this occasional reading it means a process in which the entropy of the system remains unchanged for example this could occur in a system where the work done on the system includes friction internal to the system and heat is withdrawn from the system in just the right amount to compensate for the internal friction so as to leave the entropy unchanged the second law of thermodynamics states that where formula 2 is the amount of energy the system gains by heating formula 3is the temperature of the surroundings and formula 4 is the change in entropy the equal sign refers to a reversible process which is an imagined idealized theoretical limit never actually occurring in physical reality with essentially equal temperatures of system and surroundings for an isentropic process

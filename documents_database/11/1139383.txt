nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone 1 beta subcomplex subunit 6 is an accessory subunit of the nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone complex located in the mitochondrial inner membrane it is also known as complex i and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain the ndufb6 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 9 in position 21 1 and is 19 659 base pairs long the ndufb6 protein weighs 15 5 kda and is composed of 128 amino acids ndufb6 is a subunit of the enzyme nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone the largest of the respiratory complexes the structure is l shaped with a long hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the nadh binding site it has been noted that the n terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a c terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of complex i the highly conserved two domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone complex at the inner

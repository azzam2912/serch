research on fungal mating has focused on several model species with different behaviour not all fungi reproduce sexually and many that do are isogamous thus the terms male and female do not apply to many members of the fungal kingdom homothallic species are able to mate with themselves while in heterothallic species only isolates of opposite mating types can mate mating between isogamous fungi may consist only of a transfer of nuclei from one cell to another vegetative incompatibility within species often prevent a fungal isolate from mating with another isolate isolates of the same incompatibility group do not mate or mating does not lead to successful offspring high variation has been reported including same chemotype mating sporophyte to gametophyte mating and biparental transfer of mitochondria a zygomycete hypha grows towards a compatible mate and they both form a bridge called a progametangia by joining at the hyphal tips via plasmogamy a pair of septa forms around the merged tips enclosing nuclei from both isolates a second pair of septa forms two adjacent cells one on each side these adjacent cells called suspensors provide structural support the central cell is destined to become a spore the nuclei join in a

all lobodontine seals have circumpolar distributions surrounding antarctica they include both the world s most abundant seal the crabeater seal and the only predominantly mammal eating seal the leopard seal while the weddell seal prefers the shore fast ice the other species live primarily on and around the off shore pack ice thus though they are collectively the most abundant group of seals in the world the combination of remote range and inaccessible habitat make them among the least well studied of the world s seals the lobondontini are thought to have diverged from the elephant seals mirounga in the late miocene or early pliocene after moving southward from the atlantic to the southern ocean all species share teeth adaptations including lobes and cusps useful for straining smaller prey items out of the water the name lobodontini meaning lobe toothed nonetheless they have diversified into specialized prey ecological niches thereby illustrating the radiating sympatric speciation associated with colonization of a novel environment with multiple available niches thus the crabeater seal with the most specialized sieve like dental features is the only seal that feeds predominantly on antarctic krill while the leopard seal is the only seal which actively preys on

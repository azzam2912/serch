they all contain at least two electrical conductors called plates separated by an insulating layer called the dielectric capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices capacitors together with resistors and inductors belong to the group of passive components used in electronic equipment although in absolute figures the most common capacitors are integrated capacitors e g in drams or flash memory structures this article is concentrated on the various styles of capacitors as discrete components small capacitors are used in electronic devices to couple signals between stages of amplifiers as components of electric filters and tuned circuits or as parts of power supply systems to smooth rectified current larger capacitors are used for energy storage in such applications as strobe lights as parts of some types of electric motors or for power factor correction in ac power distribution systems standard capacitors have a fixed value of capacitance but adjustable capacitors are frequently used in tuned circuits different types are used depending on required capacitance working voltage current handling capacity and other properties in a conventional capacitor the electric energy is stored statically by charge separation typically electrons in an electric field between two electrode

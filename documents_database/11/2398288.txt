semertzidis is a physicist exploring axions as a dark matter candidate precision physics in storage rings including muon g 2 and proton electric dipole moment pedm the axion and the pedm are intimately connected through the strong cp problem furthermore if the pedm is found to be non zero it can help resolve the matter anti matter asymmetry mystery of our universe during his research career he held a number of positions in the department of physics in brookhaven national laboratory including initiator and co spokesperson of the storage ring electric dipole moment collaboration he is the founding director of the institute for basic science ibs center for axion and precision physics research is a professor in the physics department of kaist and a fellow of the american physical society with more than 300 publications to his name his research has been cited over 15 000 times giving him an h index of 46 and i10 index of 91 semertzidis received a bachelor of science in physics from the aristotle university of thessaloniki greece in 1984 he then moved to new york and studied at the university of rochester obtaining master of science and ph d in physics in 1987

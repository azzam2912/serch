sylow subgroups carter subgroups and abelian subgroups of locally finite groups have been studied the concept is credited to work in the 1930s by russian mathematician sergei chernikov a locally finite group is a group for which every finitely generated subgroup is finite since the cyclic subgroups of a locally finite group are finitely generated hence finite every element has finite order and so the group is periodic examples non examples the class of locally finite groups is closed under subgroups quotients and extensions locally finite groups satisfy a weaker form of sylow s theorems if a locally finite group has a finite p subgroup contained in no other p subgroups then all maximal p subgroups are finite and conjugate if there are finitely many conjugates then the number of conjugates is congruent to 1 modulo p in fact if every countable subgroup of a locally finite group has only countably many maximal p subgroups then every maximal p subgroup of the group is conjugate the class of locally finite groups behaves somewhat similarly to the class of finite groups much of the 1960s theory of formations and fitting classes as well as the older 19th century and 1930s theory

deoxycholic acid is one of the secondary bile acids which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria the two primary bile acids secreted by the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid bacteria metabolize chenodeoxycholic acid into the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid and they metabolize cholic acid into deoxycholic acid there are additional secondary bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid deoxycholic acid is soluble in alcohol and acetic acid when pure it comes in a white to off white crystalline powder form deoxycholic acid has been used since its discovery in various fields of human medicine in the human body deoxycholic acid is used in the emulsification of fats for absorption in the intestine it has in some countries including switzerland been licensed as an emulsifier in food industry but it is no longer common outside the body it is used in experimental basis of cholagogues and is also in use to prevent and dissolve gallstones in research deoxycholic acid is used as a mild detergent for the isolation of membrane associated proteins the critical micelle concentration for deoxycholic acid is approximately 2 4 4 mm sodium deoxycholate the sodium salt of deoxycholic acid is often used as a biological

it is included within the ward of heath town landmarks within the district include the site of wolverhampton low level railway station and the disused springfield brewery that made springfield bitter from 1873 to 1991 the brewery first opened in 1873 when the william butler and company needed bigger premises than their existing site in priestfield springfield had an abundance of water and the land had remained fairly undeveloped as the ground was quite marshy in places the company acquired the seven acre site partly bordering grimstone street and built a new brewery with maltings cooperage and stables production started at springfield during the following year with the new brewery located close to the canal and railway lines the company could begin to trade outside of the local area the good communications also made the acquisition of public houses in other areas a viable proposition this opportunity was improved when the great western railway extended a siding into the site which was continually expanding to cope with the success of the company between 1881 3 a new brewing tower was constructed enabling william butler and company to increase production from 400 to 1 500 barrels a week in 1960 mitchell

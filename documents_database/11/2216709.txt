it is a complicated process involving many steps once the feathers are fully developed there are six different types of feathers contour flight down filoplumes semiplumes and bristle feathers feathers were not originally meant for flight the exact reason why feathers evolved is still unknown birds are thought to be descendants of dinosaurs and new technology using melanosomes found in dinosaur fossils has shown that certain dinosaurs that could not fly had feathers feathers are products of the epidermis and keratinizing system they are non vascular and non nervous they have a tubular central shaft called the rachis coming off either side of the rachis are the veins which have a series of barbs with interlocking connections that are called barbules the rachis and attached veins make up the spathe the opposite of the rachis is the calamus which anchors the feather to the body and is moved by attached dermal muscles there are many different types of feathers that mostly follow this basic design with few variations based on evolutionary needs feathers are sometimes referred to as elaborate reptile scales just as birds are sometimes viewed as a subset of reptiles instead of their own category although this is

sony was the first to reduce these problems and their costs sufficiently to introduce a 5 megapixel 1 75 m bi cmos sensor at general consumer prices in 2009 bi sensors from omnivision technologies have since been used in consumer electronics from other manufacturers as in the htc evo 4g android smartphone and as a major selling point for the camera in apple s iphone 4 a traditional front illuminated digital camera is constructed in a fashion similar to the human eye with a lens at the front and photodetectors at the back this traditional orientation of the sensor places the active matrix of the digital camera image sensor a matrix of individual picture elements on its front surface and simplifies manufacturing the matrix and its wiring however reflect some of the light and thus the photocathode layer can only receive the remainder of the incoming light the reflection reduces the signal that is available to be captured a back illuminated sensor contains the same elements but arranges the wiring behind the photocathode layer by flipping the silicon wafer during manufacturing and then thinning its reverse side so that light can strike the photocathode layer without passing through the wiring

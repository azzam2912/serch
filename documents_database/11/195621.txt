this was designated the european telephony numbering space or etns although some etns numbers were assigned few phone companies supported connecting calls to etns because of limited support and the belief that the need for etns was superseded by uris etns was suspended in 2005 and abolished in 2008 all ets numbers were cancelled by the beginning of 2010 the 388 code was scheduled to be reclaimed by the itu at the end of 2010 as of late 2011 it was listed by itu as group of countries shared code see also list of country calling codes geographically the 388 country code was an overlay on top of all the pre existing state bounded country codes of the countries in europe among special country codes 388 was unique in that it was both supranational yet geographically bounded other special codes such as 881 and freephone 800 are completely international instead of being subdivided geographically as in a typical numbering plan the etns was intended to be subdivided by type of service or customer it would therefore not have been possible to reverse engineer the location of an owner of an etns number based on the characteristics of the phone number

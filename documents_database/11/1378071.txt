the inverse of sla is leaf mass per area lma specific leaf area is a ratio indicating how much leaf area a plant builds with a given amount of leaf biomass formula 1 where a is the area of a given leaf or all leaves of a plant and m is the dry mass of those leaves typical units are m kg or mm mg leaf mass per area lma is its inverse and can mathematically be decomposed in two component variables leaf thickness lth and leaf density ld formula 2 typical units are g m for lma m for lth and g ml for ld both sla and lma are frequently used in plant ecology and biology sla is one of the components in plant growth analysis and mathematically scales positively and linearly with the relative growth rate of a plant lma mathematically scales positively with the investments plants make per unit leaf area amount of protein and cell wall cell number per area and with leaf longevity since linear positive relationships are more easily analysed than inverse negative relationships researchers often use either variable depending on the type of questions asked normal ranges of sla and lma are

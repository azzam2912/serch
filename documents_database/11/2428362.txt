nations including britain china france germany india ireland israel the netherlands norway costa rica denmark and spain have looked to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels at the consumer level currently the largest concern surrounding electric vehicle transportation is the total travel range available before the need to recharge the longest range recorded to date was 606 2 miles achieved by a tesla model 3 however this was conducted in very controlled conditions where the car maintained a constant speed without the added drain of the air conditioning compressor typically the battery would last for approximately 300 miles the equivalent to three days of city commuting in warmer weather or one day in colder weather with these limitations long distance trips are currently unsuited for an electric car unless rapid charging stations are available on the route of the trip the process of a battery charging and discharging involves lithium ions from a positive electrode passing through a separator electrolyte the ions then transfer via a solid electrolyte interface sei and intercalate into the negative electrode the potential negative impact for rapid charging is that battery aging may be accelerated by the unstable sei produced by charging and discharging multiple

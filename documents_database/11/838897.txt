like its mechanistic cousins ip and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose cyclic adp ribose naadp binds to and opens ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see calcium signalling structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the house keeping enzyme cofactor nadp by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent ca mobilizing second messenger yet described naadp acts across phyla from plants to man in their landmark 1987 paper hon cheung lee and colleagues discovered not one but two ca mobilizing second messengers cadpr and naadp from the effects of nucleotides on ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates it turns out that naadp was a contaminant in commercial sources of nadp but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved the first demonstration that naadp could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later subsequently naadp has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few the first demonstration that naadp levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose

in 1890 he published a new correct proof using successive approximations let d be an open subset of r r with a continuous function and a continuous explicit first order differential equation defined on d then every initial value problem for f with formula 4 has a local solution where formula 6 is a neighbourhood of formula 7 in formula 8 such that formula 9 for all formula 10 the solution need not be unique one and the same initial value x y may give rise to many different solutions z the peano theorem can be compared with another existence result in the same context the picard lindel f theorem the picard lindel f theorem both assumes more and concludes more it requires lipschitz continuity while the peano theorem requires only continuity but it proves both existence and uniqueness where the peano theorem proves only the existence of solutions to illustrate consider the ordinary differential equation according to the peano theorem this equation has solutions but the picard lindel f theorem does not apply since the right hand side is not lipschitz continuous in any neighbourhood containing 0 thus we can conclude existence but not uniqueness it turns out that

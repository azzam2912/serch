reliable global records of climate only began in the 1880s and proxies provide the only means for scientists to determine climatic patterns before record keeping began examples of proxies include ice cores tree rings sub fossil pollen boreholes corals lake and ocean sediments and carbonate speleothems the character of deposition or rate of growth of the proxies material has been influenced by the climatic conditions of the time in which they were laid down or grew chemical traces produced by climatic changes such as quantities of particular isotopes can be recovered from proxies some proxies such as gas bubbles trapped in ice enable traces of the ancient atmosphere to be recovered and measured directly to provide a history of fluctuations in the composition of the earth s atmosphere to produce the most precise results systematic cross verification between proxy indicators is necessary for accuracy in readings and record keeping proxies can be combined to produce temperature reconstructions longer than the instrumental temperature record and can inform discussions of global warming and climate history the distribution of proxy records just like the instrumental record is not at all uniform with more records in the northern hemisphere in science it is sometimes

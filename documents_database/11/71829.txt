an abelian group a is called a torsion or periodic group if every element of a has finite order and is called torsion free if every element of a except the identity is of infinite order the proof that a is closed under addition relies on the commutativity of addition see examples section if a is abelian then the torsion subgroup t is a fully characteristic subgroup of a and the factor group a t is torsion free there is a covariant functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of torsion groups that sends every group to its torsion subgroup and every homomorphism to its restriction to the torsion subgroup there is another covariant functor from the category of abelian groups to the category of torsion free groups that sends every group to its quotient by its torsion subgroup and sends every homomorphism to the obvious induced homomorphism which is easily seen to be well defined if a is finitely generated and abelian then it can be written as the direct sum of its torsion subgroup t and a torsion free subgroup but this is not true for all infinitely generated abelian groups in any decomposition of

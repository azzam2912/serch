the best known relativistic classical field theory of gravitation general relativity is a tensor theory in which the gravitational interaction is described using a tensor field the prototypical scalar theory of gravitation is newtonian gravitation in this theory the gravitational interaction is completely described by the potential formula 1 which is required to satisfy the poisson equation with the mass density acting as the source of the field to wit formula 2 where this field theory formulation leads directly to the familiar law of universal gravitation formula 4 the first attempts to present a relativistic classical field theory of gravitation were also scalar theories gunnar nordstr m created two such theories nordstr m s first idea 1912 was to simply replace the divergence operator in the field equation of newtonian gravity with the d alembertian operator formula 5 this gives the field equation however several theoretical difficulties with this theory quickly arose and nordstr m dropped it a year later nordstr m tried again presenting the field equation where formula 8 is the trace of the stress energy tensor solutions of nordstr m s second theory are conformally flat lorentzian spacetimes that is the metric tensor can be written as

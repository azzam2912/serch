because of this only very small amounts of catalyst are required to alter the reaction rate in principle in general chemical reactions occur faster in the presence of a catalyst because the catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy than the non catalyzed mechanism in catalyzed mechanisms the catalyst usually reacts to form a temporary intermediate which then regenerates the original catalyst in a cyclic process a substance which provides a mechanism with a higher activation energy does not decrease the rate because the reaction can still occur by the non catalyzed route an added substance which does reduce the reaction rate is not considered a catalyst but a reaction inhibitor see below catalysts may be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous a homogeneous catalyst is one whose molecules are dispersed in the same phase usually gaseous or liquid as the reactant s molecules a heterogeneous catalyst is one whose molecules are not in the same phase as the reactant s which are typically gases or liquids that are adsorbed onto the surface of the solid catalyst enzymes and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category in the presence of a catalyst less free

optical rotatory dispersion can be used to find the absolute configuration of metal complexes for example when plane polarized white light from an overhead projector is passed through a cylinder of sucrose solution a spiral rainbow is observed perpendicular to the cylinder when white light passes through a polarizer the extent of rotation of light depends on its wavelength short wavelengths are rotated more than longer wavelengths per unit of distance because the wavelength of light determines its color the variation of color with distance through the tube is observed this dependence of specific rotation on wavelength is called optical rotatory dispersion in all materials the rotation varies with wavelength the variation is caused by two quite different phenomena the first accounts in most cases for the majority of the variation in rotation and should not strictly be termed rotatory dispersion it depends on the fact that optical activity is actually circular birefringence in other words a substance which is optically active transmits right circularly polarized light with a different velocity from left circularly polarized light in addition to this pseudodispersion which depends on the material thickness there is a true rotatory dispersion which depends on the variation with wavelength

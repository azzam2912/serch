while exoelectrogen is the predominant name other terms have been used electrochemically active bacteria anode respiring bacteria and electricigens electrons exocytosed in this fashion are produced following atp production using an electron transport chain etc during oxidative phosphorylation conventional cellular respiration requires a final electron acceptor to receive these electrons cells that use molecular oxygen o as their final electron acceptor are described as using aerobic respiration while cells that use other soluble compounds as their final electron acceptor are described as using anaerobic respiration however the final electron acceptor of an exoelectrogen is found extracellularly and can be a strong oxidizing agent in aqueous solution or a solid conductor electron acceptor two commonly observed acceptors are iron compounds specifically fe iii oxides and manganese compounds specifically mn iii iv oxides as oxygen is a strong oxidizer cells are able to do this strictly in the absence of oxygen utilization of exoelectrogens is currently being researched in the development of microbial fuel cells mfcs which hold the potential to convert organic material like activated sludge from waste water treatment into ethanol hydrogen gas and electric current while the exact process in which a cell will reduce an extracellular acceptor will

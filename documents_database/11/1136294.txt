although the term may not be used the concept is also used in roof design and landscape architecture if the drainage gradient is too low rain and melt water drainage will be insufficient this results in water pooling on the road surface thereby increasing the risk for hydroplaning and wet pavement vehicle crashes most road design manuals require drainage gradient to exceed 0 5 in order to drain water and prevent excessive skid accidents one exception to the minimum 0 5 dg limit can be found in the norwegian road design manual where the minimum drainage gradient is 2 instead of 0 5 typically on straight road sections the drainage gradient is at least 1 3 due to the normal cross slope of 1 3 in curved sections the drainage gradient is higher and may often reach 5 12 due to superelevated cs that may reach 5 8 in areas with icy roads and up to 12 in areas without icy roads the road s longitudinal slope contributes to a high drainage gradient however longitudinal highway slopes steeper than 0 5 are surprisingly rare outside hilly or mountainous areas due to the normal cross slope and the interaction with grade

these programs when run on any up to date computer can play games in which the best human players are easily defeated this is because although the consequences of moves are predictable for both computers and humans computers are better at envisaging them computer othello programs search for any possible legal moves using a game tree in theory they examine all positions nodes where each move by one player is called a ply this search continues until a certain maximum search depth or the program determines that a final leaf position has been reached a naive implementation of this approach known as minimax or negamax can only search to a small depth in a practical amount of time so various methods have been devised to greatly increase the speed of the search for good moves these are based on alpha beta pruning negascout mtd f negac the alphabeta algorithm is a method for speeding up the minimax searching routine by pruning off cases that will not be used anyway this method takes advantage of the fact that every other level in the tree will maximize and every other level will minimize several heuristics are also used to reduce the size

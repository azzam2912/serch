it is the sublattice of the leech lattice fixed by a certain automorphism of order 3 and is analogous to the barnes wall lattice the coxeter todd lattice can be made into a 6 dimensional lattice self dual over the eisenstein integers the automorphism group of this complex lattice has index 2 in the full automorphism group of the coxeter todd lattice and is a complex reflection group number 34 on the list with structure 6 psu f 2 called the mitchell group the genus of the coxeter todd lattice was described by and has 10 isometry classes all of them other than the coxeter todd lattice have a root system of maximal rank 12 based on nebe web page we can define k using following 6 vectors in 6 dimensional complex coordinates is complex number of order 3 i e 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 by adding vectors having scalar product and multiplying by we can obtain all lattice vectors we have 15 combinations of two zeros times 16 possible signs gives 240

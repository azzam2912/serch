it is only known from subfossil bones its closest relative was the living australian musk duck biziura lobata with which it has sometimes been combined the first discovery of the fossil remains of the duck a single tarsometatarsus associated with large numbers of moa bones was made at enfield near oamaru in the south island of new zealand it was first described as biziura delautouri in march 1892 by dr henry forbes the director of the canterbury museum in christchurch at the time who named it after dr h de lautour of oamaru who helped acquire the specimen another paper by forbes later used the spelling biziura lautouri but the earlier name has priority subsequently additional material was obtained from marfells beach adjacent to lake grassmere at the north eastern end of the south island and described in 1969 by ron scarlett who considered the bird to be referable to b lobata later finds of musk duck fossils have been made at lake poukawa and waikuku beach on the north island the duck was evidently very similar to the australian musk duck though complications in interpreting measurements of the bones arise from the australian and apparently the new zealand birds

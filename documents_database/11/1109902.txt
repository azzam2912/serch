mercury like the other group 12 elements cadmium and zinc has an sd electron configuration and generally only forms bonds involving its 6s orbital this means that the highest oxidation state mercury normally attains is ii and for this reason it is usually considered a post transition metal instead of a transition metal hgf was first reported from experiments in 2007 but its existence remains disputed experiments conducted in 2008 could not replicate the compound speculation about higher oxidation states for mercury had existed since the 1970s and theoretical calculations in the 1990s predicted that it should be stable in the gas phase with a square planar geometry consistent with a formal d configuration however experimental proof remained elusive until 2007 when hgf was first prepared using solid neon and argon for matrix isolation at a temperature of 4 k the compound was detected using infrared spectroscopy analysis of density functional theory and coupled cluster calculations showed that the d orbitals are involved in bonding leading to the suggestion that mercury should be considered a transition metal after all however that conclusion has been challenged by w b jensen with the argument that hgf only exists under highly atypical non

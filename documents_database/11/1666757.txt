its finer structure can be described in the language of quasi categories as an a category they are named after kenji fukaya who introduced the formula 5 language first in the context of morse homology and exist in a number of variants as fukaya categories are a categories they have associated derived categories which are the subject of the celebrated homological mirror symmetry conjecture of maxim kontsevich this conjecture has been computationally verified for a number of comparatively simple examples let formula 6 be a symplectic manifold for each pair of lagrangian submanifolds formula 7 suppose they intersect transversely then define the floer cochain complex formula 8 which is a module generated by intersection points formula 9 the floer cochain complex is viewed as the set of morphisms from formula 10 to formula 11 the fukaya category is an formula 12 category meaning that besides ordinary compositions there are higher composition maps formula 13 it is defined as follows choose a compatible almost complex structure formula 14 on the symplectic manifold formula 6 for generators formula 16 of the cochain complexes on the left and any generator formula 17 of the cochain complex on the right the moduli space of

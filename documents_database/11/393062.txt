the effects of water pollution may not be immediately visible because of a sewage system that helps drain off toxic substances if those substances turn out to be persistent e g persistent organic pollutant however they will literally be fed back to their producers via the food chain plankton edible fish humans in that respect a considerable number of environmental hazards listed below are man made anthropogenic hazards hazards can be categorized in four types chemical hazards are defined in the globally harmonized system and in the european union chemical regulations they are caused by chemical substances causing significant damage to the environment the label is particularly applicable towards substances with aquatic toxicity an example is zinc oxide a common paint pigment which is extremely toxic to aquatic life toxicity or other hazards do not imply an environmental hazard because elimination by sunlight photolysis water hydrolysis or organisms biological elimination neutralizes many reactive or poisonous substances persistence towards these elimination mechanisms combined with toxicity gives the substance the ability to do damage in the long term also the lack of immediate human toxicity does not mean the substance is environmentally nonhazardous for example tanker truck sized spills of substances such

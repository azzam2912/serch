the first few terms of the sequence are sylvester s sequence is named after james joseph sylvester who first investigated it in 1880 its values grow doubly exponentially and the sum of its reciprocals forms a series of unit fractions that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit fractions with the same number of terms the recurrence by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude but due to the rapid growth of the sequence complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite egyptian fraction representations of 1 sasakian einstein manifolds and hard instances for online algorithms formally sylvester s sequence can be defined by the formula the product of an empty set is 1 so s 2 alternatively one may define the sequence by the recurrence it is straightforward to show by induction that this is equivalent to the other definition the sylvester numbers grow doubly exponentially as a function of n specifically it can be shown that for a number e that is approximately

cdc14 is found in most of the eukaryotes cdc14 was defined by hartwell in his famous screen for loci that control the cell cycle of saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc14 was later shown to encode a protein phosphatase cdc14 is dual specificity which means it has serine threonine and tyrosine directed activity a preference for serines next to proline is reported many early studies especially in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that the protein plays a key role in regulating late mitotic processes however more recent work in a range of systems suggests that its cellular function is more complex in saccharomyces cerevisiae the species in which cdc14 activity is best understood and most studied the activity of cdc14 sccdc14 leads to mitotic exit by dephosphorylating targets of cdk1 a well studied cyclin dependent protein kinase cdc14 antagonizes cdk1 by stimulating proteolysis of its cyclin partner cyclin b through the dephosphorylation of cdh1 a regulator of the anaphase promoting complex cdc14 also dephosphorylates swi5 to enhance transcription of sic1 an inhibitor of cdk1 this simple mitotic exit model became complicated as additional roles in mitosis were attributed to sccdc14 these included stabilizing the spindle and regulating cytokinesis and rdna telomere segregation

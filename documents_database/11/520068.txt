the physicist j j thomson posed the problem in 1904 after proposing an atomic model later called the plum pudding model based on his knowledge of the existence of negatively charged electrons within neutrally charged atoms related problems include the study of the geometry of the minimum energy configuration and the study of the large n behavior of the minimum energy the physical system embodied by the thomson problem is a special case of one of eighteen unsolved mathematics problems proposed by the mathematician steve smale distribution of points on the 2 sphere the solution of each n electron problem is obtained when the n electron configuration constrained to the surface of a sphere of unit radius formula 1 yields a global electrostatic potential energy minimum formula 2 the electrostatic interaction energy occurring between each pair of electrons of equal charges formula 3 with formula 4 the elementary charge of an electron is given by coulomb s law here formula 6 is coulomb s constant and formula 7 is the distance between each pair of electrons located at points on the sphere defined by vectors formula 8 and formula 9 respectively simplified units of formula 10 and formula 11 are

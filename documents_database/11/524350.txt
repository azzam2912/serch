the classical form of it was first given by after preliminary versions of it were found by and the sheaf theoretic version is due to hirzebruch one form of the riemann roch theorem states that if d is a divisor on a non singular projective surface then where is the holomorphic euler characteristic the dot is the intersection number and k is the canonical divisor the constant 0 is the holomorphic euler characteristic of the trivial bundle and is equal to 1 p where p is the arithmetic genus of the surface for comparison the riemann roch theorem for a curve states that d 0 deg d noether s formula states that where 0 is the holomorphic euler characteristic c k k is a chern number and the self intersection number of the canonical class k and e c is the topological euler characteristic it can be used to replace the term 0 in the riemann roch theorem with topological terms this gives the hirzebruch riemann roch theorem for surfaces for surfaces the hirzebruch riemann roch theorem is essentially the riemann roch theorem for surfaces combined with the noether formula to see this recall that for each divisor d on

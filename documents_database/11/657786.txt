these tasks may be carried out by people nature or machines using various resources an engineering process must be considered in the context of the agents carrying out the tasks and the resource attributes involved systems engineering normative documents and those related to maturity models are typically based on processes for example systems engineering processes of the eia 632 and processes involved in the capability maturity model integration cmmi institutionalization and improvement approach constraints imposed on the tasks and resources required to implement them are essential for executing the tasks mentioned semiconductor process engineers face the unique challenge of transforming raw materials into high tech devices common semiconductor devices include integrated circuits ics light emitting diodes leds solar panels and solid state lasers to produce these and other semiconductor devices semiconductor process engineers rely heavily on interconnected physical and chemical processes a prominent example of these combined processes is the use of ultra violet photo lithography which is then followed by wet etching the process of creating an ic pattern that is transferred onto an organic coating and etched onto the underlying semiconductor chip other examples include the ion implantation of dopant species to tailor the electrical properties of a

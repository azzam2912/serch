this grouping was suggested by morphological synapomorphies and confirmed by phylogenomic analyses of molecular data xenacoelomorphs emerged with the nephrozoa as sister clade the clade xenacoelomorpha grouping acoelomorpha and the genus xenoturbella was revealed by molecular studies initially it was considered to be a member of the deuterostomes but a more recent transcriptome analysis concluded that it is the sister group to the nephrozoa which includes the protostomes and the deuterostomes being therefore the basalmost bilaterian clade all xenacoelomorphs lack a typical stomatogastric system i e they do not have a true gut in acoels the mouth opens directly into a large endodermal syncytium while in nemertodermatids and xenoturbellids there is a sack like gut lined by unciliated cells the nervous system is basiepidermal i e located right under the epidermis and a brain is absent in xenoturbellids it is constituted by a simple nerve net without any special concentration of neurons while in acoelomorphs it is arranged in a series of longitudinal bundles united in the anterior region by a ring comissure of variable complexity the sensory organs include a statocyst and in some groups two unicellular ocelli the epidermis of all xenacoelomorphans is ciliated the cilia are composed

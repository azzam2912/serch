most common areas of application are medicine and sports the simplest force platform is a plate with a single pedestal instrumented as a load cell better designs have a pair of rectangular plates although triangular can also work one over another with load cells or triaxial force transducers between them at the corners like single force platforms dual force platforms can be used to assess performance in double leg tests and strength and power asymmetries in unilateral jump and isometric tests however they also provide an additional level of intelligence on neuromuscular status by evaluating the force distribution between limbs during double limb tests revealing critical information on strength asymmetries and compensatory strategies the simplest force plates measure only the vertical component of the force in the geometric center of the platform more advanced models measure the three dimensional components of the single equivalent force applied to the surface and its point of application usually called the centre of pressure cop as well as the vertical moment of force cylindrical force plates have also been constructed for studying arboreal locomotion including brachiation force platforms may be classified as single pedestal or multi pedestal and by the transducer force and moment

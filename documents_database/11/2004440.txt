sebastian pichelhofer discovered this thread in 2008 and assisted with the project by developing an elphel camera internal hard disk recorder user interface by early 2009 and because over the course of three years upwards of 1000 posts had been submitted to this thread the community realised that it was going to be difficult to maintain a full overview of the project in this way and consequently a dedicated website was established all of the decision making and naming logo design was decided upon by the community after having done some contracting work with elphel pichelhofer focused full time on the project across 2011 and in july 2012 the plan to create an axiom camera hardware prototype from scratch and thereby overcome some of the limitations that were found to be inherent with elphel hardware at the time mainly due to elphel inc having shifted the company s core business focus towards development of a panoramic camera solution was announced at the libre software meeting in geneva this prototype became known as axiom alpha and was intended to gather feedback from typical shooting scenarios with a view to incorporating ideas into a future more modular kit version of the camera

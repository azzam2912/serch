it consists of an oxygen and hydrogen atom held together by a covalent bond and carries a negative electric charge it is an important but usually minor constituent of water it functions as a base a ligand a nucleophile and a catalyst the hydroxide ion forms salts some of which dissociate in aqueous solution liberating solvated hydroxide ions sodium hydroxide is a multi million ton per annum commodity chemical a hydroxide attached to a strongly electropositive center may itself ionize liberating a hydrogen cation h making the parent compound an acid the corresponding electrically neutral compound ho is the hydroxyl radical the corresponding covalently bound group oh of atoms is the hydroxy group hydroxide ion and hydroxy group are nucleophiles and can act as a catalysts in organic chemistry many inorganic substances which bear the word hydroxide in their names are not ionic compounds of the hydroxide ion but covalent compounds which contain hydroxy groups the hydroxide ion is a natural part of water because of the self ionization reaction in which its complement hydronium is passed hydrogen the equilibrium constant for this reaction defined as has a value close to 10 at 25 c so the concentration of hydroxide

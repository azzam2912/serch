the object being modelled may be small for example an atom or large for example the solar system the geometry of the model and the object it represents are often similar in the sense that one is a rescaling of the other in such cases the scale is an important characteristic however in many cases the similarity is only approximate or even intentionally distorted sometimes the distortion is systematic e g a fixed scale horizontally and a larger fixed scale vertically when modelling topography of a large area as opposed to a model of a smaller mountain region which may well use the same scale horizontally and vertically showing the true slopes physical models allow visualization from examining the model of information about the thing the model represents a model can be a physical object such as an architectural model of a building uses of an architectural model include visualization of internal relationships within the structure or external relationships of the structure to the environment other uses of models in this sense are as toys instrumented physical models are an effective way of investigating fluid flows for engineering design physical models are often coupled with computational fluid dynamics models to

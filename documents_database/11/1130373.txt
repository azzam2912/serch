these may be of different shape e g platelets fibers spheroids but at least one dimension must be in the range of 1 50 nm these pnc s belong to the category of multi phase systems mps viz blends composites and foams that consume nearly 95 of plastics production these systems require controlled mixing compounding stabilization of the achieved dispersion orientation of the dispersed phase and the compounding strategies for all mps including pnc are similar alternatively polymer can be infiltrated into 1d 2d 3d preform creating high content polymer nanocomposites polymer nanoscience is the study and application of nanoscience to polymer nanoparticle matrices where nanoparticles are those with at least one dimension of less than 100 nm the transition from micro to nano particles lead to change in its physical as well as chemical properties two of the major factors in this are the increase in the ratio of the surface area to volume and the size of the particle the increase in surface area to volume ratio which increases as the particles get smaller leads to an increasing dominance of the behavior of atoms on the surface area of particle over that of those interior of the particle

a meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas symbols or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing speech gestures rituals or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self replicate mutate and respond to selective pressures proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution memes do this through the processes of variation mutation competition and inheritance each of which influences a meme s reproductive success memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct while others may survive spread and for better or for worse mutate memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts a field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically however

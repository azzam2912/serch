more specifically the conjecture states that certain de rham cohomology classes are algebraic that is they are sums of poincar duals of the homology classes of subvarieties it was formulated by the scottish mathematician william vallance douglas hodge as a result of a work in between 1930 and 1940 to enrich the description of de rham cohomology to include extra structure that is present in the case of complex algebraic varieties it received little attention before hodge presented it in an address during the 1950 international congress of mathematicians held in cambridge massachusetts the hodge conjecture is one of the clay mathematics institute s millennium prize problems with a prize of 1 000 000 for whoever can prove or disprove the hodge conjecture let x be a compact complex manifold of complex dimension n then x is an orientable smooth manifold of real dimension 2 n so its cohomology groups lie in degrees zero through 2 n assume x is a k hler manifold so that there is a decomposition on its cohomology with complex coefficients where h x is the subgroup of cohomology classes which are represented by harmonic forms of type p q that is these are the

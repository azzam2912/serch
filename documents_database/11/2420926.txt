it is used by dragonfly bsd in its vkernel implementation since dragonfly 1 7 having been first revealed in and first released in the stable branch with dragonfly 1 8 in the long term goal in addition to easing kernel development is to make it easier to support internet connected computer clusters without compromising local security similar concepts exist in other operating systems as well in linux a similar virtualisation concept is known as user mode linux whereas in netbsd since the summer of 2007 it has been the initial focus of the rump kernel infrastructure the virtual kernel concept is nearly the exact opposite of the unikernel concept with vkernel kernel components get to run in userspace to ease kernel development and debugging supported by a regular operating system kernel whereas with a unikernel userspace level components get to run directly in kernel space for extra performance supported by baremetal hardware or a hardware virtualisation stack however both vkernels and unikernels can be used for similar tasks as well for example to self contain software to a virtualised environment with low overhead in fact netbsd s rump kernel originally having a focus of running kernel components in userspace has

it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time with a fixed offset of epoch it is also the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth s surface when another leap second was added tai is exactly 37 seconds ahead of utc the 37 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972 plus 27 leap seconds in utc since 1972 tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth specifically both julian dates and the gregorian calendar are used tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of 1958 and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over 400 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide the majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks the international system of units si definition of the second is based on caesium the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer due to the signal

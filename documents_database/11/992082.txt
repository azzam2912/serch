ecological vegetation classes are groupings of vegetation communities based on floristic structural and ecological features the victorian department of environment land water and planning has defined all of the evcs within victoria an evc consists of one or a number of floristic communities that appear to be associated with a recognisable environmental niche and which can be characterised by a number of their adaptive responses to ecological processes that operate at the landscape scale level each ecological vegetation class is described through a combination of its floristic life form and reproductive strategy profiles and through an inferred fidelity to particular environmental attributes although there are more than 300 individual evcs some can be grouped together to form a bioregion which is a geographical approach to classifying the environment using a climate geomorphology geology soils and vegetation there are 28 bioregions across victoria each evc within a biogregion can be assigned a conservation status to indicate its degree of alteration since european settlement in australia to assist with the assessment of an evc within a bioregion benchmarks have been established to ensure that assessments are carried out in a standard fashion across victoria ecological vegetation classes developed from earlier approaches to

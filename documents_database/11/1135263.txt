despite its importance the first attempts were made only in the 1950 60s to derive the value of the visual background due to galaxies at that time based on the integrated starlight of these stellar systems in the 1960s the absorption of starlight by dust was already taken into account but without considering the re emission of this absorbed energy in the infrared at that time jim peebles pointed out that in a big bang created universe there must have been a cosmic infrared background cib different from the cosmic microwave background that can account for the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies in order to produce today s metallicity early galaxies must have been significantly more powerful than they are today in the early cib models the absorption of starlight was neglected therefore in these models the cib peaked between 1 10 m wavelengths these early models have already shown correctly that the cib was most probably fainter than its foregrounds and so it was very difficult to observe later the discovery and observations of high luminosity infrared galaxies in the vicinity of the milky way showed that the peak of the cib is most likely at longer

the idea is to harvest the abundant nitrogen ice on the surface of triton and use it as propellant for multiple short flights and explore a variety of locations the concept transitioned in march 2018 to phase ii to refine their designs and explore aspects of implementing the new technology triton is the largest moon of neptune in 1989 voyager 2 flew past the moon at a distance of 40 000 km and discovered several cryovolcanoes on its surface triton is geologically active its surface is young and has relatively few impact craters it has a very thin atmosphere the triton hopper concept started phase i in 2015 and it transitioned in march 2018 to phase ii where the new technologies are being matured by nasa s institute for advanced concepts niac the triton hopper concept proposes the use of a radioisotope rocket engine that would collect nitrogen ice on or below the surface heat it under pressure and use it as propellant to explore neptune s moon triton the largest technological challenge is to learn how to mine local surface nitrogen ice and how to heat it for use as propellant the rocket powered hops are estimated to be

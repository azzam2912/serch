his scientific visualizations have been published in scientific american and nature among other journals most recently hoffman has been involved in the solar start up company sun synchrony which is developing his solar inventions james hoffman has created software for scientific visualization particularly of surface geometries studied in differential geometry while a graduate student at the university of massachusetts amherst james was enlisted by mathematician david hoffman to help prove an important result in minimal surface geometry discovering the first new examples of complete embedded minimal surfaces in more than one hundred years the first example the costa surface was described in 1983 by brazilian graduate student celso costa as an equation but a proof that it was embedded lacked self intersections was provided by david hoffman and william meeks who used computer visualizations created by james to see that the surface was embedded and dissect it to prove that it was this finding followed by the discovery of scores of other surfaces and families of surfaces illustrated by hoffman s computer graphics overturned a century old conjecture that the only examples of such minimal surfaces where the plane catenoid and helicoid hoffman s work has been featured in articles

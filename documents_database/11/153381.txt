it states that if a v b r k design exists with v b a symmetric block design then the theorem was proved in the case of projective planes in it was extended to symmetric designs in in the special case of a symmetric design with 1 that is a projective plane the theorem which in this case is referred to as the bruck ryser theorem can be stated as follows if a finite projective plane of order q exists and q is congruent to 1 or 2 mod 4 then q must be the sum of two squares note that for a projective plane the design parameters are v b q q 1 r k q 1 1 thus v is always odd in this case the theorem for example rules out the existence of projective planes of orders 6 and 14 but allows the existence of planes of orders 10 and 12 since a projective plane of order 10 has been shown not to exist using a combination of coding theory and large scale computer search the condition of the theorem is evidently not sufficient for the existence of a design however no stronger general non existence criterion

while a phd student at king s college london he worked under the supervision of rosalind franklin their crystallographic experiments together with those of maurice wilkins of the same laboratory produced data that helped james watson and francis crick to infer the structure of dna he was born in 1926 and attended school in wembley he studied physics at university college london from 1944 to 1947 and became a hospital physicist at the king s fund and middlesex hospital between 1947 and 1949 before joining king s college london as a research student from which he eventually received his phd when he arrived at king s college london gosling was directed by sir john randall to work on the problem of the structure of dna randall was convinced that dna was the material which transmitted the genetic code randall assigned him to work on x ray diffraction with maurice wilkins analysing samples of dna which they prepared by hydrating and drawing out into thin filaments and photographing in a hydrogen atmosphere he made the first x ray diffraction image of crystallized dna his comment on this discovery was i must be the first person ever to make genes crystallize although

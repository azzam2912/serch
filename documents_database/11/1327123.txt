to start a diluted cleaning solution is sprayed onto all surfaces to be cleaned using the same machine the area is then rinsed this is typically followed by vacuum suctioning that removes the applied liquid along with the suspended solids and dissolved contaminants that have been removed from the surface a key advantage of this method over traditional approaches is the ability to deep clean grouted areas e g wall counter and floor tile preventing buildup of soil and bacteria in grout lines application of a cleaning solution followed by pressurized rinsing and vacuuming removes soil more effectively than methods that rely solely on absorbent wiping e g mopping microfiber and cleaning cloth use in addition studies published by the international sanitary supply association issa have found that compared to legacy methods these systems potentially reduce cleaning times by 1 3 or more unlike outdoor pressure washers with application pressures of 1 000 spray and vac units are designed for long term indoor use on grout and other surfaces and offer variable application pressures ranging from 110 the first spray and vac system was developed by inventor robert s robinson in 1997 a us patent was issued in 2001 and

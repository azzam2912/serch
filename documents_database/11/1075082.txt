the hypothesis began with carl linnaeus in 1758 and was again advanced by j d smith in 1980 it was proposed in its modern form by australian neuroscientist jack pettigrew in 1986 after he discovered that the connections between the retina and the superior colliculus a region of the midbrain in the megabat pteropus were organized in the same way found in primates and purportedly different from all other mammals this was followed up by a longer study published in 1989 in which this was supported by the analysis of many other brain and body characteristics pettigrew suggested that flying foxes colugos and primates were all descendants of the same group of early arboreal mammals the megabat flight and the colugo gliding could be both seen as locomotory adaptations to a life high above the ground the flying primate hypothesis met resistance from many zoologists its biggest challenges were not centered on the argument that megabats and primates are evolutionarily related which reflects earlier ideas such as the grouping of primates tree shrews colugos and bats under the same taxonomic group the superorder archonta rather many biologists resisted the implication that megabats and microbats or echolocating bats formed distinct branches

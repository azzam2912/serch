because of the high amount of technical knowledge required the total number of actual manufacturers remains very small the process starts with two basic ingredients an acrylic resin powder polymer and clear liquid monomer the polymer and monomer are mixed together in specific proportions the result is a thick opaque liquid the mixture is hand poured into molds and allowed to partially harden objects to be embedded are then hand placed into the acrylic layer another layer is poured over the embedded object and the acrylic is again allowed to harden during this stage the liquid acrylic is an opaque milky white it is very difficult to center objects on multiple levels when the objects below cannot be clearly seen because these embedded objects are placed by hand no two acrylic embedments are ever exactly alike after the acrylic has hardened the molds are placed into an oven there heat cures and pressure exceeding 12 atmospheres compresses the air bubbles to completely harden the embedment this curing process may take up to seven hours after cooling the acrylic embedments are removed from the molds and the sizing process begins all acrylic parts are cast oversized to allow for shrinkage which

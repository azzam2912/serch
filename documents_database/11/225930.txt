they consist of stoichiometric mixtures of strong oxidisers and reactive fuels mixed just prior to use in order to enhance safety either the oxidiser or the fuel or both should be a liquid to facilitate mixing and intimate contact between the materials for a fast reaction rate sprengel suggested nitric acid nitrates and chlorates as oxidisers and nitroaromatics e g nitrobenzene as fuels other sprengel explosives used at various times include charcoal with liquid oxygen an oxyliquit rackarock and anfo ammonium nitrate oxidiser mixed with a fuel oil fuel normally diesel kerosene or nitromethane eventually anfo supplanted all others because its oxidiser was the safest and due to its widespread use as a fertiliser in agriculture also the cheapest rackarock consisted of potassium chlorate and nitrobenzene it was provided in the form of permeable cartridges of the chlorate which were placed in wire baskets and dipped in the nitrobenzene for a few seconds before use for underwater use it could be provided in cans instead it was famously used in the massive submarine demolition of flood rock a navigational hazard in long island sound in 1885 the charge of over a hundred tonnes of explosive laid in tunnels 20 metres

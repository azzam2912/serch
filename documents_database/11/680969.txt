cassiopeiae is a multiple star with a combined apparent magnitude of 4 95 the two brightest components are a and c sometimes called and cas cas a is an f0 bright supergiant of magnitude 4 95 and cas c is a 7 08 magnitude b6 supergiant at 134 cassiopeiae appears among the stars of the open cluster ngc 457 which is at 2 400pc but it is uncertain whether it is a member of the cluster cas is generally treated as having five component stars designated a to e in order of distance from the brightest star the two components a and c are the brightest and the only two supergiant members of ngc 457 they are sometimes referred to as and cassiopeiae component b is a 12th magnitude star 49 from components d and e and both 10th magnitude b type main sequence stars in ngc 457 with component e only 42 from another three components are sometimes listed as components of the multiple system although this is somewhat arbitrary with dozens of members of ngc 457 being found within a few arc minutes the two supergiants share a similar space motion to the other stars in the cluster

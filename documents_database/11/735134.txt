although their fossils are relatively rare and their group small in numbers they lived across all continents except australia for approximately 100 million years from the late triassic to the early cretaceous heterodontosaurids were fox sized dinosaurs less than in length including a long tail they are known mainly for their characteristic teeth including enlarged canine like tusks and cheek teeth adapted for chewing analogous to those of cretaceous hadrosaurids their diet was herbivorous or possibly omnivorous among heterodontosaurids only heterodontosaurus itself is known from a complete skeleton fragmentary skeletal remains of abrictosaurus are known but have not been fully described while most other heterodontosaurids are known only from jaw fragments and teeth consequently most heterodontosaurid synapomorphies defining features have been described from the teeth and jaw bones heterodontosaurus measured just over 1 meter 3 3 ft in length while the fragmentary remains of lycorhinus may indicate a larger individual tianyulong from china appears to preserve filamentous integument which has been interpreted to be a variant of the proto feathers found in some theropods these filaments include a crest along its tail the presence of this filamentous integument has been used to suggest that both ornithischians and saurischians were endothermic

coined in 2001 by game designer lewis pollak to describe his role playing game children of the sun the term has since been applied to a variety of visual art music motion pictures fiction and engineering the name dieselpunk is a derivative of the 1980s science fiction genre cyberpunk and represents the time period from world war i until the 1950s when diesel based locomotion was the main technological focus of western culture the punk suffix attached to the name is representative of the counterculture nature of the genre with regards to its opposition to contemporary aesthetics the term also refers to the tongue in cheek name given to a similar cyberpunk derivative steampunk which focuses on science fiction based on industrial steam power and which is often set within the victorian era author scott westerfeld addresses the question of where to draw the line between steampunk and dieselpunk arguing that his novel leviathan 2009 qualifies as steampunk despite the fact that the technology it depicts includes diesel engines i like the word dieselpunk if you are doing something like weird world war ii i think that makes perfect sense but to me world war i is the dividing point

given a function formula 1 i e from the real numbers to the real numbers we can decide if it is injective by looking at horizontal lines that intersect the function s graph if any horizontal line formula 2 intersects the graph in more than one point the function is not injective to see this note that the points of intersection have the same y value because they lie on the line formula 2 but different x values which by definition means the function cannot be injective variations of the horizontal line test can be used to determine whether a function is surjective or bijective consider a function formula 4 with its corresponding graph as a subset of the cartesian product formula 5 consider the horizontal lines in formula 5 formula 7 the function f is injective if and only if each horizontal line intersects the graph at most once in this case the graph is said to pass the horizontal line test if any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once the function fails the horizontal line test and is not injective

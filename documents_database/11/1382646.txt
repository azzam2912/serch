examples of this type of gait include crawling in snakes or swimming in the lamprey although this is typically the type of gait utilized by limbless animals some creatures with limbs such as the salamander choose to forgo use of their legs in certain environments and exhibit undulatory locomotion this movement strategy is important to study in order to create novel robotic devices capable of traversing a variety of environments in limbless locomotion forward locomotion is generated by propagating flexural waves along the length of the animal s body forces generated between the animal and surrounding environment lead to a generation of alternating sideways forces that act to move the animal forward these forces generate thrust and drag simulation predicts that thrust and drag are dominated by viscous forces at low reynolds numbers and inertial forces at higher reynolds numbers when the animal swims in a fluid two main forces are thought to play a role at low reynolds number re 10 skin friction accounts for nearly all of the thrust and drag for those animals which undulate at intermediate reynolds number re 10 such as the ascidian larvae both skin friction and form force account for the production of

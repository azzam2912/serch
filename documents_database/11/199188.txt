this improves the safety of storing transporting and disposing of the weapon commonly firing the munition removes a barrier between two precursors these react to form the intended agent which is then aerosolized and distributed by a bursting charge binary chemical weapons are chemical weapons within the scope of the chemical weapons convention and therefore their production use and stockpiling is forbidden in most countries as at least one of the individual chemicals is likely to be a schedule 1 chemical for which large scale production is forbidden one example of a binary chemical weapon is the united states army m687 in the m687 methylphosphonyl difluoride military name df a schedule 1 chemical and a mixture of two agents held in chambers within the munition separated by a partition when the weapon is fired acceleration causes the partition to break and the precursors are mixed by the rotation of the munition in flight producing sarin nerve agent the soviet union and later russian federation experimented with binary munitions capable of mixing and distributing two agents that would work together in worsening the weapon s effects an example of which would be the combination of nerve agents with blister agents the

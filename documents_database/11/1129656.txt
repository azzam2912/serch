it is a member of the kr ppel like factor family of zinc finger transcription factors and it has been implicated in a variety of biochemical processes in the human body including lung development embryonic erythropoiesis epithelial integrity t cell viability and adipogenesis erythroid kr ppel like factor eklf or klf1 was the first kr ppel like factor discovered it was found to be vitally important for embryonic erythropoiesis in promoting the switch from fetal hemoglobin hemoglobin f to adult hemoglobin hemoglobin a gene expression by binding to highly conserved caccc domains eklf ablation in mouse embryos produces a lethal anemic phenotype causing death by embryonic day 14 and natural mutations lead to thalassemia in humans however expression of embryonic hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin genes is normal in eklf deficient mice and since all genes on the human globin locus exhibit the caccc elements researchers began searching for other kr ppel like factors klf2 initially called lung kr ppel like factor due to its high expression in the adult mouse lung was first isolated in 1995 by using the zinc finger domain of eklf as a hybridization probe by transactivation assay in mouse fibroblasts klf2 was also noticed to bind

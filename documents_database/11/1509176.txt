the aws project was started in 1980 by uw madison atmospheric sciences professor charles r stearns currently the uw madison aws project operates and maintains 57 automated weather stations in antarctica more than half of all stations currently known to be operating on the continent automated weather stations have multiple different sensors that measure temperature wind speed and direction relative humidity and pressure in 1978 professor alan peterson at the radio sciences lab at stanford university developed the original antarctic automated weather station key operational aspects to the original aws were low voltage circuitry and the argos satellite communications system the argos satellite communication system transmits observational data from every aws to polar orbiting weather satellites and then to mid latitude receiving stations for analysis and archiving data from the uw madison antarctic aws program has been used for many research studies including but not limited to boundary layer meteorology studies near the south pole katabatic wind studies at reeves glacier and the adelie coast long term ecological research along the antarctic peninsula and barrier wind flow studies along the transantarctic mountains and the antarctic peninsula additional studies include flight forecasting and long term climatology studies at dome c in

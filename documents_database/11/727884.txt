however the construction only works asymptotically up to a certain order of approximation there is in general an obstruction to continuing this extension past the critical order the obstruction itself is of tensorial character and is known as the conformal obstruction tensor it is along with the weyl tensor one of the two primitive invariants in conformal differential geometry aside from the obstruction tensor the ambient construction can be used to define a class of conformally invariant differential operators known as the gjms operators a related construction is the tractor bundle the model flat geometry for the ambient construction is the future null cone in minkowski space with the origin deleted the celestial sphere at infinity is the conformal manifold m and the null rays in the cone determine a line bundle over m moreover the null cone carries a metric which degenerates in the direction of the generators of the cone the ambient construction in this flat model space then asks if one is provided with such a line bundle along with its degenerate metric to what extent is it possible to extend the metric off the null cone in a canonical way thus recovering the ambient minkowski space

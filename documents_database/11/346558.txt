it was developed between 1894 and 1909 by geomorphologists and quaternary geologists to subdivide glacial and nonglacial deposits within the united states of america from youngest to oldest they were the wisconsinian stage glacial sangamonian interglacial illinoian glacial yarmouthian interglacial kansan glacial aftonian interglacial and nebraskan glacial stages the yarmouthian yarmouth interglacial was defined first on the basis of interglacial sediments encountered in wells dug in southeasterm iowa later the yarmouth yarmouthian stage in illinois was defined on the basis of the yarmouth paleosol soil developed in the surface of what were thought at that time to be kansan glacial tills and buried by illionian glacial tills of the glasford formation in southeast iowa and east central illinois at this time it was incorrectly presumed that the yarmouth paleosol formed during a single interglacial stage that separated a younger glacial stage the illinoian glaciation represented by the sediments of the glasford formation in illinois and the glacial deposits of an older glacial stage called the kansan glaciation since the yarmouthian yarmouth interglacial was named the stratigraphy of pleistocene deposits was found to be far more complex than the two glacial tills and one volcanic ash bed on which the yarmouthian

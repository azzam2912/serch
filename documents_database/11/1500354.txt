wolowelsky and david shakow in their article describing a method for constructing a magic square whose order is a multiple of 4 a 4 4 magic square can be constructed by writing out the numbers from 1 to 16 consecutively in a 4 4 matrix and then interchanging those numbers on the diagonals that are equidistant from the center figure 1 the sum of each row column and diagonal is 34 the magic number for a 4 4 magic square in general the magic number for an n n magic square is n n 2 1 2 as seen in the example for a 6 6 square figure 2 the properties of the mystic square are related to those of a 6 6 magic square the sum of the diagonals is 111 the magic number for a 6 6 magic square the sums of the rows increase arithmetically with a common difference of 12 and an average of 111 the columns also increase arithmetically with a common difference of 2 and an average of 111 the quotient of the two common differences is 6 this pattern proves true for all values of n for the special case of n 4

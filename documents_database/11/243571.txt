the name is a concatenation of the roman numeral x meaning ten and the initials of attachment unit interface the purpose of the xgmii extender which is composed of an xgxs xgmii extender sublayer at the mac end an xgxs at the phy end and a xaui between them is to extend the operational distance of the xgmii and to reduce the number of interface signals applications include extending the physical separation possible between mac and phy components in a 10 gigabit ethernet system distributed across a circuit board xgmii extender has the following characteristics the following is a list of the major concepts of xgxs and xaui reduced pin extended attachment unit interface rxaui is a proprietary modification created by marvell and dune networks later acquired by broadcom aimed to increase the port density by decreasing the interface pin count the four lanes of the standard xaui running at 3 125 gbit s are replaced by two lanes at 6 25 gbit s thus 16 pins of an integrated circuit 4 transmit 4 receive differential pairs can provide either one xaui port or two rxaui ports the specification also defines a xaui to rxaui adapter and provides an implementation

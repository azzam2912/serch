the probability of photoionization is related to the photoionization cross section of the species which depends on the energy of the photon proportional to its wavenumber and the species being considered in the case of molecules the photoionization cross section can be estimated by examination of franck condon factors between a ground state molecule and the target ion for photon energies below the ionization threshold the photoionization cross section is near zero but with the development of pulsed lasers it has become possible to create extremely intense coherent light where multi photon ionization may occur at even higher intensities around of infrared or visible light non perturbative phenomena such as barrier suppression ionization and rescattering ionization are observed several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom this probability decreases rapidly with the number of photons required but the development of very intense pulsed lasers still makes it possible in the perturbative regime below about 10 w cm at optical frequencies the probability of absorbing n photons depends on the laser light intensity i as i for higher intensities this dependence becomes invalid due to the then occurring ac stark effect resonance

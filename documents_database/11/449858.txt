various techniques are employed to estimate the parameters from matrices of response data the most common approaches are types of maximum likelihood estimation such as joint and conditional maximum likelihood estimation joint maximum likelihood jml equations are efficient but inconsistent for a finite number of items whereas conditional maximum likelihood cml equations give consistent and unbiased item estimates person estimates are generally thought to have bias associated with them although weighted likelihood estimation methods for the estimation of person parameters reduce the bias the rasch model for dichotomous data takes the form where formula 2 is the ability of person formula 3 and formula 4 is the difficulty of item formula 5 let formula 6 denote the observed response for person n on item i the probability of the observed data matrix which is the product of the probabilities of the individual responses is given by the likelihood function the log likelihood function is then where formula 9 is the total raw score for person n formula 10 is the total raw score for item i n is the total number of persons and i is the total number of items solution equations are obtained by taking partial derivatives with

mutations to this gene have been implicated in a number of human cancers particularly acute myeloid leukaemia in 1989 a virally encoded portion of the chromosomal mouse cbl gene was the first member of the cbl family to be discovered and was named v cbl to distinguish it from normal mouse c cbl the virus used in the experiment was a mouse tropic strain of murine leukemia virus isolated from the brain of a mouse captured at lake casitas california known as cas br m and was found to have excised approximately a third of the original c cbl gene from a mouse into which it was injected sequencing revealed that the portion carried by the retrovirus encoded a tyrosine kinase binding domain and that this was the oncogenic form as retroviruses carrying full length c cbl did not induce tumor formation the resultant transformed retrovirus was found to consistently induce a type of pre b lymphoma known as casitas b lineage lymphoma in infected mice full length c cbl has been found to consist of several regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains this domain structure and the tyrosine and serine rich content of the protein product is typical

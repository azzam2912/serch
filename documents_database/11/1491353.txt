specific locations include the tennessee river in alabama and georgia the wabash river in indiana and the cheat river kanawha river non native and new river in west virginia between 1894 and 1949 only three specimens had been definitively identified later however the number of popeye shiners began to increase even in places that had been well documented previously and showed no trace of the popeye shiner popeye shiners are freshwater insectivores they consume aquatic insects including midges caddisflies mayflies and beetles these benthopelagic fish are found in temperate waters particularly large creeks and small rivers that are extremely clear and have gravel bottoms the bodies of water in which they are found also tend to have slow to moderate flow it is precisely the water flow and preferred clarity of water that makes survival difficult since the popeye shiner lives in pristine clear water any contamination may adversely affect this property and subsequently diminish the ability of these fish to thrive industrialization may lead to sedimentation as well as siltation due to increased runoff as a result of agricultural practices over time the erosion will create an unsuitable habitat for the popeye shiner and species abundance will decrease another

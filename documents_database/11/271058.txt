it can be obtained as a slice of the rhombicosidodecahedron the pentagonal cupola consists of 5 equilateral triangles 5 squares 1 pentagon and 1 decagon the following formulae for volume surface area and circumradius can be used if all faces are regular with edge length a formula 1 formula 2 formula 3 the dual of the pentagonal cupola has 10 triangular faces and 5 kite faces in geometry the crossed pentagrammic cupola is one of the nonconvex johnson solid isomorphs being topologically identical to the convex pentagonal cupola it can be obtained as a slice of the nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron or quasirhombicosidodecahedron analogously to how the pentagonal cupola may be obtained as a slice of the rhombicosidodecahedron as in all cupolae the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top in this case the base polygon is a decagram it may be seen as a cupola with a retrograde pentagrammic base so that the squares and triangles connect across the bases in the opposite way to the pentagrammic cuploid hence intersecting each other more deeply

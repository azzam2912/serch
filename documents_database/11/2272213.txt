i taylor consider a plane wall located at formula 1 in the cylindrical coordinates formula 2 moving with a constant velocity formula 3 towards the left consider another plane wall scraper at an inclined position making an angle formula 4 from the positive formula 5 direction and let the point of intersection be at formula 6 this description is equivalent to moving the scraper towards right with velocity formula 3 the problem is singular at formula 6 because at the origin the velocities are discontinuous thus the velocity gradient is infinite there taylor noticed that the inertial terms are negligible as long as the region of interest is within formula 9 or equivalently reynolds number formula 10 thus within the region the flow is essentially a stokes flow for example george batchelor gives a typical value for lubricating oil with velocity formula 11 as formula 12 then for two dimensional planar problem the equation is where formula 14 is the velocity field and formula 15 is the stream function the boundary conditions are attempting a separable solution of the form formula 17 reduces the problem to with boundary conditions the solution is therefore the velocity field is pressure can be

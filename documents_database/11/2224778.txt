it aired on fox in the united states on september 25 2016 in the episode louise comes down with the flu and has a wizard of oz esque fever dream involving a disfigured kuchi kopi and her toys who have the voices of her family louise comes down with the flu and falls into a wild fever dream filled with familiar faces zany musical numbers and a crazy adventure alasdair wilkins of the a v club gave the episode an a saying flu ouise could have hit its themes and character beats harder in its fantasy sequences but that would have likely meant drawing even closer visual parallels between the toys and louise s family or using their actions as more obvious allegories for louise s frustrations with their failures the episode doesn t go down this more obvious route instead casting the other belchers in a more broadly drawn fantastical adventure it s not as tightly focused on louise learning a specific lesson or working through her issues as it could have been which whatever weaknesses that might entail does mean the episode can throw in delightful generally belcher like character bits like the bear building a sun deck

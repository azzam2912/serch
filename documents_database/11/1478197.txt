antigen retrieval is an approach to reducing or eliminating these chemical modifications the two primary methods of antigen retrieval are heat mediated epitope retrieval hier and proteolytic induced epitope retrieval pier in pier enzymes including proteinase k trypsin and pepsin have been used to restore antibody binding to its epitope the purported mechanism of action is cleavage of peptides masking the epitope restoring antigenicity disadvantages of pier include a low success rate for restoring immunoreactivity and the potential destruction of tissue morphology and the antigen of interest hier is believe to reverse some cross links and allows for restoration of secondary of tertiary structure of the epitope the protocol requires optimisation for each tissue fixation method and antigen to be studied in general hier has a much higher success rate than pier hier can be performed with microwave ovens pressure cookers vegetable steamers autoclaves or water baths hier is time temperature buffer and ph sensitive rter involves reversal of cross links using acids such as hydrochloric acid ph 1 or formic acid ph 2

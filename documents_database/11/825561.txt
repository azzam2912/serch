pco2 is higher and ventilation is lower in sleep sleep onset in normal subjects is not immediate but oscillates between arousal stage i and ii sleep before steady nrem sleep is obtained so falling asleep results in decreased ventilation and a higher pco2 above the wakefulness set point on wakefulness this constitutes an error signal which provokes hyperventilation until the wakefulness set point is reached when the subject falls asleep ventilation decreases and pco2 rises resulting in hypoventilation or even apnea these oscillations continue until steady state sleep is obtained the medulla oblongata controls our respiration breathing is remarkably regular both in amplitude and frequency in steady nrem sleep steady nrem sleep has the lowest indices of variability of all sleep stages minute ventilation decreases by 13 in steady stage ii sleep and by 15 in steady slow wave sleep stage iii and stage iv sleep mean inspiratory flow is decreased but inspiratory duration and respiratory cycle duration are unchanged resulting in an overall decreased tidal volume in a study of 19 healthy adults the minute ventilation in nrem sleep was 7 18 0 39 sem liters minute compared to 7 66 0 34 liters minute when awake rib cage

when a system containing a plasma is at equilibrium it is possible for certain parts of the plasma to be disturbed by small perturbative forces acting on it the stability of the system determines if the perturbations will grow oscillate or be damped out in many cases a plasma can be treated as a fluid and its stability analyzed with magnetohydrodynamics mhd mhd theory is the simplest representation of a plasma so mhd stability is a necessity for stable devices to be used for nuclear fusion specifically magnetic fusion energy there are however other types of instabilities such as velocity space instabilities in magnetic mirrors and systems with beams there are also rare cases of systems e g the field reversed configuration predicted by mhd to be unstable but which are observed to be stable probably due to kinetic effects plasma instabilities can be divided into two general groups plasma instabilities are also categorised into different modes e g with reference to a particle beam beta is a ratio of the plasma pressure over the magnetic field strength formula 1 mhd stability at high beta is crucial for a compact cost effective magnetic fusion reactor fusion power density varies roughly

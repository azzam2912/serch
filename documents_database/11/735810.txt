activin binds to either acvr2a or acvr2b and then forms a complex with acvr1b these go on to recruit the r smads smad2 or smad3 acvr1b also transduces signals of nodal gdf 1 and vg1 however unlike activin they require other coreceptor molecules such as the protein cripto activins are dimeric growth and differentiation factors which belong to the transforming growth factor beta tgf beta superfamily of structurally related signaling proteins activins signal through a heteromeric complex of receptor serine kinases which include at least two type i i and ib and two type ii ii and iib receptors these receptors are all transmembrane proteins composed of a ligand binding extracellular domain with a cysteine rich region a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain with predicted serine threonine specificity type i receptors are essential for signaling and type ii receptors are required for binding ligands and for expression of type i receptors type i and ii receptors form a stable complex after ligand binding resulting in phosphorylation of type i receptors by type ii receptors this gene encodes activin a type ib receptor composed of 11 exons alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation result in 3 fully described transcript variants the

using this method they were able to determine the distribution of radionuclides in the surrounding area and discovered emissions from the nuclear reactor itself these emissions included fuel particles radioactive gases and aerosol particles the fuel particles were due to the violent interaction between hot fuel and the cooling water in the reactor and attached to these particles were cerium zirconium lanthanum and strontium all of these elements have low volatility meaning they prefer to stay in a liquid or solid state rather than condensing into the atmosphere and existing as vapor cerium and lanthanum can cause irreversible damage to marine life by deteriorating cell membranes affecting reproductive capability as well as crippling the nervous system strontium in its non nuclear isotope is stable and harmless however when the radioactive isotope sr is released into the atmosphere it can lead to anemia cancers and cause shortages in oxygen the aerosol particles had traces of tellurium a highly toxic element which can create issues in developing fetuses along with caesium which is an unstable incredibly reactive and toxic element also found in the aerosol particles was enriched uranium 235 the most prevalent radioactive gas detected was radon a noble gas that

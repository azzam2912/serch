this is particularly applied in fluent interfaces for example in dart the cascade is equivalent to the individual calls method cascading is much less common than method chaining it is found only in a handful of object oriented languages while chaining is very common a form of cascading can be implemented using chaining but this restricts the interface see comparison with method chaining below cascading is syntactic sugar that eliminates the need to list the object repeatedly this is particularly used in fluent interfaces which feature many method calls on a single object this is particularly useful if the object is the value of a lengthy expression as it eliminates the need to either list the expression repeatedly or use a temporary variable for example instead of either listing an expression repeatedly or using a temporary variable cascading allows the expression to be written once and used repeatedly given a method call codice 1 after executing the call method cascading evaluates this expression to the left object codice 2 with its new value if mutated while method chaining evaluates this expression to the right object the following chain in c is equivalent to the simple form the following cascade in

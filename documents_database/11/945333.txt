site specific recombinases ssrs perform rearrangements of dna segments by recognizing and binding to short dna sequences sites at which they cleave the dna backbone exchange the two dna helices involved and rejoin the dna strands while in some site specific recombination systems just a recombinase enzyme and the recombination sites is enough to perform all these reactions in other systems a number of accessory proteins and or accessory sites are also needed multiple genome modification strategies among these recombinase mediated cassette exchange rmce an advanced approach for the targeted introduction of transcription units into predetermined genomic loci rely on the capacities of ssrs site specific recombination systems are highly specific fast and efficient even when faced with complex eukaryotic genomes they are employed in a variety of cellular processes including bacterial genome replication differentiation and pathogenesis and movement of mobile genetic elements nash 1996 for the same reasons they present a potential basis for the development of genetic engineering tools recombination sites are typically between 30 and 200 nucleotides in length and consist of two motifs with a partial inverted repeat symmetry to which the recombinase binds and which flank a central crossover sequence at which the recombination takes

images obtained from these surfaces by coherent imaging systems such as laser sar and ultrasound suffer from a common interference phenomenon called speckle the origin of this phenomenon is seen if we model our reflectivity function as an array of scatterers because of the finite resolution at any time we are receiving from a distribution of scatterers within the resolution cell these scattered signals add coherently that is they add constructively and destructively depending on the relative phases of each scattered waveform speckle results from these patterns of constructive and destructive interference shown as bright and dark dots in the image although commonly referred to as speckle noise speckle is not noise in its generally understood sense of an unwanted modification to a desired signal rather it is the signal itself that fluctuates because the scatterers are not identical for each cell and the signal is highly sensitive to small variations in scatterers speckle in conventional radar increases the mean grey level of a local area speckle in sar is generally serious causing difficulties for image interpretation it is caused by coherent processing of backscattered signals from multiple distributed targets in sar oceanography for example speckle is caused by signals

as an operation on binary relations the tensor product was introduced by alfred north whitehead and bertrand russell in their principia mathematica 1912 it is also equivalent to the kronecker product of the adjacency matrices of the graphs the notation g h is also sometimes used to represent another construction known as the cartesian product of graphs but more commonly refers to the tensor product the cross symbol shows visually the two edges resulting from the tensor product of two edges this product should not be confused with the strong product of graphs the tensor product is the category theoretic product in the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms that is a homomorphism to g h corresponds to a pair of homomorphisms to g and to h in particular a graph i admits a homomorphism into g h if and only if it admits a homomorphism into g and into h to see that in one direction observe that a pair of homomorphisms and yields a homomorphism in the other direction a homomorphism can be composed with the projections homomorphisms to yield homomorphisms to g and to h the adjacency matrix of g h is the tensor product of the

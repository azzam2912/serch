the capitalization used is multitronic spelled by audi with a lower case leading m and is a registered trademark of audi ag based on the principles of continuously variable transmission cvt popularised by daf multitronic offers a stepless automatic transmission in which the ratio between the input shaft and output shaft can be varied continuously within a given range providing virtually an infinite number of possible ratios the multitronic system uses a link plate chain drive an oil cooled multi plate clutch initially of six parts later of seven to enable it to cope better with the high torque outputs of larger turbodiesel engines and complex electronics to overcome the traditional shortcomings of cvts the transmission is monitored and regulated by audi s dynamic regulating programme drp which tracks the driver s inputs from how the driver applies the throttle pedal driving conditions and engine load to compute the optimal gear ratio for fuel efficiency or maximum performance as mandated by the user the transmission can select pre programmed underdrive to increase performance or overdrive to improve economy from 2004 multitronic transmissions offered manual selection of a sport mode to pre select the performance mapping the electronic system also includes

since the long march third stage cannot restart it cannot circularize a gso or geo orbit from a geosyncronous transfer orbit gto with its restart capability yuanzheng has enabled the deployment of satellite pairs for the beidou navigation satellite system in meo and communications satellites in gso this eliminates the need for the spacecraft to include a liquid apogee engine or an apogee kick motor yuanzheng has a thrust of with a specific impulse of 315 5 seconds it uses the storable hypergolic propellants unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine udmh and dinitrogen tetroxide and can perform at least two burns within its rated life of 6 5 hours sufficient to reach the transfer orbit apogee and perform the circularization burn from there operational variants are designated yz 1 for long march 3b and 3c yz 1a for long march 7 yz 1s for long march 2c yz 2 for long march 5 and yz 3 for long march 2d yuanzheng was presented in a 2013 paper and performed its first mission on 30 may 2015 the debut flight of the long march 7 in 2016 included an improved version called yuanzheng 1a that can flexibly deploy multiple payloads into various target orbits further

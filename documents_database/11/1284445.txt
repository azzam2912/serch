an experiment is said to be random if it has more than one possible outcome and deterministic if it has only one a random experiment that has exactly two mutually exclusive possible outcomes is known as a bernoulli trial when an experiment is conducted one and only one outcome results although this outcome may be included in any number of events all of which would be said to have occurred on that trial after conducting many trials of the same experiment and pooling the results an experimenter can begin to assess the empirical probabilities of the various outcomes and events that can occur in the experiment and apply the methods of statistical analysis random experiments are often conducted repeatedly so that the collective results may be subjected to statistical analysis a fixed number of repetitions of the same experiment can be thought of as a composed experiment in which case the individual repetitions are called trials for example if one were to toss the same coin one hundred times and record each result each toss would be considered a trial within the experiment composed of all hundred tosses a random experiment is described or modeled by a mathematical construct known

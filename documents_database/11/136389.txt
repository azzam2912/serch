it is related to the hydroxy functional group c o h found in all alcohols silanols are often invoked as intermediates in organosilicon chemistry and silicate mineralogy if a silanol contains one or more organic residue it is an organosilanol the first isolated example of a silanol was etsioh reported in 1871 by albert ladenburg he prepared the silicol by hydrolysis of etsioet et ch silanols are generally synthesized by hydrolysis of halosilanes alkoxysilanes or aminosilanes chlorosilanes are the most common reactants the hydrolysis of fluorosilanes requires more forcing reagents i e alkali the alkoxysilanes silyl ethers of the type rsi or are slow to hydrolyze compared to the silyl ethers silyl acetates are faster to hydrolyze with the advantage that the released acetic acid is less aggressive for this reason silyl acetates are sometimes recommended for applications an alternative route involves oxidation of hydrosilanes a wide range of oxidants have been employed including air peracids dioxiranes and potassium permanganate for hindered silanes in the presence of metal catalysts silanes undergo hydrolysis the si o bond distance is typically about 1 65 in the solid state silanols engage in hydrogen bonding most silanols have only one oh group e g

depending on its device architecture and setup a dslam aggregates the dsl lines over its asynchronous transfer mode atm frame relay and or internet protocol network i e an ip dslam using packet transfer mode transmission convergence ptm tc protocol s stack the aggregated traffic is then directed to a telco s backbone switch via an access network an also called a network service provider nsp at up to 10 gbit s data rates the dslam acts like a network switch since its functionality is at layer 2 of the osi model therefore it cannot re route traffic between multiple ip networks only between isp devices and end user connection points the dslam traffic is switched to a broadband remote access server where the end user traffic is then routed across the isp network to the internet customer premises equipment that interfaces well with the dslam to which it is connected may take advantage of enhanced telephone voice and data line signaling features and the bandwidth monitoring and compensation capabilities it supports a dslam may or may not be located in the telephone exchange and may also serve multiple data and voice customers within a neighborhood serving area interface sometimes

it is sometimes called alkathene or polythene when used for hdpe pipes with a high strength to density ratio hdpe is used in the production of plastic bottles corrosion resistant piping geomembranes and plastic lumber hdpe is commonly recycled and has the number 2 as its resin identification code in 2007 the global hdpe market reached a volume of more than 30 million tons hdpe is known for its high strength to density ratio the density of hdpe can range from 930 to 970 kg m although the density of hdpe is only marginally higher than that of low density polyethylene hdpe has little branching giving it stronger intermolecular forces and tensile strength than ldpe the difference in strength exceeds the difference in density giving hdpe a higher specific strength it is also harder and more opaque and can withstand somewhat higher temperatures 120 c 248 f for short periods high density polyethylene unlike polypropylene cannot withstand normally required autoclaving conditions the lack of branching is ensured by an appropriate choice of catalyst e g ziegler natta catalysts and reaction conditions the physical properties of hdpe can vary depending on the molding process that is used to manufacture a specific

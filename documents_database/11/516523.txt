subacute bacterial endocarditis can be considered a form of type iii hypersensitivity among the signs of subacute bacterial endocarditis are it is usually caused by a form of viridans group streptococcus bacteria that normally live in the mouth streptococcus mutans mitis sanguis or milleri other strains of streptococci can also cause subacute endocarditis streptococcus intermedius acute and subacute infection causes about 15 of cases pertaining to infective endocarditis additional enterococci urinary tract infections and coagulase negative staphylococci can also be causative agents the mechanism of subacute bacterial endocarditis could be due to malformed stenotic valves which in the company of bacteremia become infected via adhesion and subsequent colonization of the surface area this causes an inflammatory response with recruitment of matrix metalloproteinases and destruction of collagen underlying structural valve disease is usually present in patients before developing subacute endocarditis and is less likely to lead to septic emboli than is acute endocarditis but subacute endocarditis has a relatively slow process of infection and if left untreated can worsen for up to one year before it is fatal in cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis the causative organism streptococcus viridans needs a previous heart valve disease to colonize on the other hand

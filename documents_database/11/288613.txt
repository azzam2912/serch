is a permutation automaton if and only if for every two distinct states and in q and every input symbol in q x q x a formal language is p regular also a pure group language if it is accepted by a permutation automaton for example the set of strings of even length forms a p regular language it may be accepted by a permutation automaton with two states in which every transition replaces one state by the other the pure group languages were the first interesting family of regular languages for which the star height problem was proved to be computable another mathematical problem on regular languages is the separating words problem which asks for the size of a smallest deterministic finite automaton that distinguishes between two given words of length at most n by accepting one word and rejecting the other the known upper bound in the general case is formula 1 the problem was later studied for the restriction to permutation automata in this case the known upper bound changes to formula 2

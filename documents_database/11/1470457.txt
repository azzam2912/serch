it causes the disease canine angiostrongylosis in dogs it is not zoonotic that is it cannot be transmitted to humans not much is known about the biology of this species these nematode worms are small and pinkish in color the length is 14 0 20 5 mm the width is 0 170 0 306 mm females have a barbers pole appearance the life cycle begins when l3 larvae are ingested by a definitive host primarily the fox or dog this can be through eating mollusc intermediate hosts frogs paraentenic hosts or from food infected with slime from the slugs or snails the l3 larvae migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes and moult to l4 and l5 the l5 larvae migrate through the portal circulation and through the liver and the adults end up at the pulmonary artery or right side of the heart the adults then mate and produce eggs the eggs move to the alveolar capillaries via the circulation and hatch to l1 larvae the l1 larvae burrow though the alveolar and are then coughed up and swallowed l1 larvae are therefore passed in the faeces of infected cannids the l1 larvae infect intermediate hosts primarily slugs and snails

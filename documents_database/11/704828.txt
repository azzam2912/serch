it is an important process in modern chemistry as many useful compounds bear this motif for example pyrethroids and a number of quinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin sparfloxacin etc however the high ring strain present in cyclopropanes makes them challenging to produce and generally requires the use of highly reactive species such as carbenes ylids and carbanions many of the reactions proceed in a cheletropic manner several methods exist for converting alkenes to cyclopropane rings using carbene type reagents as carbenes themselves are highly reactive it is common for them to be used in a stabilised form referred to as a carbenoid in the simmons smith reaction the reactive carbenoid is iodomethylzinc iodide which is typically formed by a reaction between diiodomethane and a zinc copper couple modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide the reactivity of the system can also be increased by exchanging the zinc copper couple for diethylzinc asymmetric versions are known certain diazo compounds such as diazomethane can react with olefins to produce cyclopropanes in a 2 step manner the first step involves a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition to form a pyrazoline which then undergoes denitrogenation either photochemically or by

pickard was a researcher in the early days of wireless while not the earliest discoverer of the rectifying properties of contact between certain solid materials he was largely responsible and most famous for the development of the crystal detector the earliest type of diode detector the crystal detector was the central component in many early radio receivers from around 1906 until about 1920 pickard also experimented with antennas radio wave propagation and noise suppression on august 30 1906 he filed a patent for a silicon crystal detector which was granted on november 20 1906 on june 10 1907 he filed a patent for a magnetic aerial a loop aerial which was granted on january 21 1908 pickard s loop antenna had directional properties that could be used to reduce interference to the intended wireless communications on june 21 1911 he filed a patent on a crystal detector incorporating a springy low inertia wire of about 24 gauge formed with a loop or helix and pointed to make contact with the crystal crystal detectors incorporating this construction would become the most widely used and popularly known by the term cat whisker detector this patent was granted on july 21 1914 greenleaf

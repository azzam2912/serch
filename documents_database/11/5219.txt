the study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via galois groups is called galois theory so named in honor of variste galois who first discovered them for a more elementary discussion of galois groups in terms of permutation groups see the article on galois theory suppose that is an extension of the field written as and read over an automorphism of is defined to be an automorphism of that fixes pointwise in other words an automorphism of is an isomorphism from to such that for each the set of all automorphisms of forms a group with the operation of function composition this group is sometimes denoted by if is a galois extension then is called the galois group of the extension over and is usually denoted by if is not a galois extension then the galois group of the extension over is sometimes defined as where is the galois closure of in the following examples is a field and are the fields of complex real and rational numbers respectively the notation indicates the field extension obtained by adjoining an element to the field the significance of an extension being galois is that

black fly larvae mayfly and stonefly nymphs paramoebidium is classified in the opisthokont class mesomycetozoea ichthyosporea and is the sole genus in the family paramoebidiidae prior to 2005 paramoebidium species were tentatively placed with the fungal group trichomycetes due to their habitation of arthropod guts host overlap between various paramoebidium and fungal trichomycete taxa and similar vegetative growth form the prefix para roughly meaning similar to refers to the assumed relatedness of paramoebidium to the genus amoebidium members of both genera may produce motile amoeba like dispersal cells during their life cycle the similarity of life cycle morphology and ecology lead to the hypothesis that amoebidium and paramoebidium were minimally closely related and probably sister taxa paramoebidium species are unicellular the vegetative cells thalli have an elongate hair like growth form with a secreted glue like holdfast at the base that attaches them to the host digestive tract lining sexual reproduction is unknown during asexual reproduction the entire content of the cell is partitioned into many motile amoeboid cells the cell wall breaks down and the amoeboid cells are released these amoeboid cells are termed dispersal amoebae because they crawl for a short time before encysting the cyst expands and

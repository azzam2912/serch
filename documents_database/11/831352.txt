the sensors use infrared ultrasonic microwave or other technology the term encompasses devices as different as pir sensors hotel room keycard locks and smart meters occupancy sensors are typically used to save energy provide automatic control and comply with building codes a vacancy sensor works like an occupancy sensor however lights must be manually turned on but will automatically turn off when motion is no longer detected occupancy sensor types include motion sensors are often used in indoor spaces to control electric lighting if no motion is detected it is assumed that the space is empty and thus does not need to be lit turning off the lights in such circumstances can save substantial amounts of energy in lighting practice occupancy sensors are sometime also called presence sensors or vacancy sensors some occupancy sensors e g lsg s pixelview philips lumimotion ecoamicatechs sirius etc also classify the number of occupants their direction of motion etc through image processing pixelview is a camera based occupancy sensor using a camera that is built into each light fixture occupancy sensors for lighting control typically use infrared ir ultrasonic tomographic motion detection microwave sensors or camera based sensors image processing the field of view

in particular snowstorms are a common occurrence over the region and have major socio economic impacts due to their significant precipitation amounts the great salt lake never freezes and can warm rapidly which allows lake enhanced precipitation to occur from september through may lake enhanced snowstorms are often attributed to creating what is locally known as the greatest snow on earth lake effect snow around the great salt lake is generated in a similar fashion to elsewhere in the world however the great salt lake primarily provides a lifting mechanism and acts as an atmospheric destabilizer which encourages convection this is in contrast to the great lakes where the lakes contribute significant amounts of moisture and latent heat great salt lake enhanced precipitation occurs when a strong cold northwesterly wind blows across a relatively warm lake this is common after a cold front passage where the winds are predominantly northwesterly and the air is much colder than the lake when the land lake breeze blows towards the lake there is a convergence zone that acts to channel the cold air over the center of the lake and further enhance precipitation the salinity of the great salt lake prevents freezing but

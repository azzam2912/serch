the catalyst is a chiral complex that contains titanium as a lewis acid the chirality of the catalyst induces a stereoselective addition so the secondary alcohol of the product has a predictable absolute stereochemistry based on the choice of catalyst this name reaction is named for gary keck the keck asymmetric allylation has many applications to the synthesis of natural products including gloeosporone epothilone a the cd subunit of spongistatins and the c10 c20 subunit of rhizoxin a the keck allylation has also been utilized to form substituted tetrahydropyrans enantioselectively moieties found in products such as phorboxazole and bryostatin 1 although the groups of e tagliavini and k mikami reported the catalysis of this reaction using a ti iv binol complex in the same year as the keck group keck s publication reported higher enantio and diastereoselectivity and did not require the use of 4 angstrom molecular sieves as in mikami s procedure or an excess of binol as in tagliavini s procedure keck s early success with stereoselectivity and the simplicity of the catalyst preparation led to many improvements in reaction design including development of other structural analogs of binol use of stoichiometric additives to enhance the reaction rate

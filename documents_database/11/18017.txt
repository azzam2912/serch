all three of these are either less or greater than an ecosystem ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water and contain characteristic geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species the biodiversity of flora fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions in theory biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant within an acceptable range of variation largely undefined at this point three caveats are appropriate for all bio geographic mapping approaches firstly no single bio geographic framework is optimal for all taxa ecoregions reflect the best compromise for as many taxa as possible secondly ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges rather ecotones and mosaic habitats bound them thirdly most ecoregions contain habitats that differ from their assigned biome biogeographic provinces may originate due to various barriers some physical plate tectonics topographic highs some climatic latitudinal variation seasonal range and some ocean chemical related salinity oxygen levels the history of the term is somewhat vague and it had been used in many contexts forest classifications loucks 1962 biome classifications

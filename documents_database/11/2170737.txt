for each of these representations there may exist different versions that correspond to the same musical work the general goal of music alignment sometimes also referred to as music synchronization is to automatically link the various data streams thus interrelating the multiple information sets related to a given musical work more precisely music alignment is taken to mean a procedure which for a given position in one representation of a piece of music determines the corresponding position within another representation in the figure on the right such an alignment is visualized by the red bidirectional arrows such synchronization results form the basis for novel interfaces that allow users to access search and browse musical content in a convenient way given two different music representations typical music alignment approaches proceed in two steps in the first step the two representations are transformed into sequences of suitable features in general such feature representations need to find a compromise between two conflicting goals on the one hand features should show a large degree of robustness to variations that are to be left unconsidered for the task at hand on the other hand features should capture enough characteristic information to accomplish the given task

the theorem is especially important in the theory of financial mathematics as it tells how to convert from the physical measure which describes the probability that an underlying instrument such as a share price or interest rate will take a particular value or values to the risk neutral measure which is a very useful tool for pricing derivatives on the underlying instrument results of this type were first proved by cameron martin in the 1940s and by girsanov in 1960 they have been subsequently extended to more general classes of process culminating in the general form of lenglart 1977 girsanov s theorem is important in the general theory of stochastic processes since it enables the key result that if q is a measure absolutely continuous with respect to p then every p semimartingale is a q semimartingale we state the theorem first for the special case when the underlying stochastic process is a wiener process this special case is sufficient for risk neutral pricing in the black scholes model and in many other models e g all continuous models let formula 1 be a wiener process on the wiener probability space formula 2 let formula 3 be a measurable process

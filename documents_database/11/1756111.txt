glycerol kinase is responsible for synthesizing triglycerides and glycerophospholipids in the body excess amounts of glycerol can be found in the blood and or urine hyperglycerolmia occurs more frequently in males hyperglycerolemia is listed as a rare disease which means it affects less than 200 000 people in the us population or less than about 1 in 1500 people the human phenotype ontology provided the following list of symptoms and signs for hyperglycerolemia abnormality of metabolism homeostasis cognitive deficit emg abnormality muscular hypotonia myopathy neurological speech impairment primary adrenal insufficiency short stature cryptorchidism eeg abnormality lumbar hyperlordosis reduced bone mineral density scoliosis seizures abnormal facial shape and adrenal insufficiency adrenal insufficiency is associated with the genetic disease x linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita if the glycerol kinase gene is deleted then the nrob1 gene is also often deleted which causes x linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita hyperglycerolemia is caused by excess glycerol in the bloodstream people with more severe cases of glycerol kinase deficiency may have a deletion of the gk gene that is large enough to see by routine cytogenetic evaluation it has been found an x linked recessive inheritance pattern of the trait when a study was conducted on a

it is located within the boundaries of the constellation of aquarius it is a member of the local group of galaxies albeit an extremely isolated one it is one of only a few known local group members for which a past close approach to the milky way or andromeda galaxy can be ruled out based on its current location and velocity local group membership was firmly established only in 1999 with the derivation of a distance based on the tip of the red giant branch method its distance from the milky way of 3 2 0 2 mly 980 40 kpc means that aquarius dwarf is quite isolated in space it is one of the least luminous local group galaxies to contain significant amounts of neutral hydrogen and support to ongoing star formation although it does so only at an extremely low level because of its large distance the hubble space telescope is required in order to study its stellar populations in detail rr lyrae stars have been discovered in aquarius dwarf indicating the existence of stars more than 10 billion years old but the majority of its stars are much younger median age 6 8 billion years among local

it is not currently used in any production explosives applications though it is used as a precursor chemical in one method of production of tatb another explosive hnb was experimentally used as a gas source for explosively pumped gas dynamic laser in this application hnb and tetranitromethane are preferred to more conventional explosives because the explosion products co and n are a simple enough mixture to simulate gas dynamic processes and quite similar to conventional gas dynamic laser medium the water and hydrogen products of many other explosives could interfere with vibrational states of co in this type of laser during world war ii a method of synthesis of hexanitrobenzene was suggested in germany and the product was supposed to be manufactured on a semi industrial scale according to the following scheme complete nitration of benzene is practically impossible because the nitro groups are deactivating groups for further nitration

examples of distributions that satisfy this condition include gaussian uniform and exponential some power law distributions also satisfy regularity distributions that satisfy the regularity condition are often referred to as regular distributions two equivalent definitions of regularity appear in the literature both are defined for continuous distributions although analogs for discrete distributions have also been considered consider a seller auctioning a single item to a buyer with random value formula 1 for any price formula 2 set by the seller the buyer will buy the item if formula 3 the seller s expected revenue is formula 4 we define the revenue function formula 5 as follows formula 6 is the expected revenue the seller would obtain by choosing formula 2 such that formula 8 in other words formula 6 is the revenue that can be obtained by selling the item with ex ante probability formula 10 finally we say that a distribution is regular if formula 11 is a concave function for a cumulative distribution function formula 12 and corresponding probability density function formula 13 the virtual valuation of the agent is defined as the valuation distribution is said to be regular if formula 15 is a monotone non decreasing

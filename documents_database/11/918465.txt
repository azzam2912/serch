scanavacca was disappointed just some months before his dismissal during the 2007 six nations championship scanavacca scored the whole amount for his team a try and a conversion at twickenham against england that defeated italy 20 7 in autumn 2007 he agreed to play another season his last with rovigo and in june 2008 he eventually announced his retirement at 34 since i joined rovigo at 6 i have always thought i had to be the first to get on the training pitch and the last to leave and that s what i have made ever since but lately i was no longer feeling that way so i understand that this is time to change i am satisfied of my career because i have always played the way i liked i have always been proud to wear the red and blue rovigo s jersey though i am aware that playing elsewhere i could have possibly won some titles he said he went on saying i have no regrets except for not having been able to show my skill in the national team not so many people there believed in me maybe it was my fault too not to mention injuries

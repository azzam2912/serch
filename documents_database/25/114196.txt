in this technique which call one of the most important tools in combinatorics one describes a finite set x from two perspectives leading to two distinct expressions for the size of the set since both expressions equal the size of the same set they equal each other this is a simple example of double counting often used when teaching multiplication to young children in this context multiplication is introduced as repeated addition and is then shown to be commutative by counting in two different ways a number of items arranged in a rectangular grid suppose the grid has formula 1 rows and formula 2 columns we first count the items by summing formula 1 rows of formula 2 items each then a second time by summing formula 2 columns of formula 1 items each thus showing that for these particular values of formula 1 and formula 2 formula 9 while not a proof it clearly shows that multiplication commutes for any example of a practical size we choose one example of the double counting method counts the number of ways in which a committee can be formed from n people allowing any number of the people even zero of them

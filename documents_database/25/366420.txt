together with its library routines gdl is developed to serve as a tool for data analysis and visualization in such disciplines as astronomy geosciences and medical imaging gdl is licensed under the gpl other open source numerical data analysis tools similar to gdl include gnu octave ncar command language ncl perl data language pdl r scilab scipy and yorick gdl as a language is dynamically typed vectorized and has object oriented programming capabilities gdl library routines handle numerical calculations e g fft data visualisation signal image processing interaction with host os and data input output gdl supports several data formats such as netcdf hdf v4 v5 grib png tiff and dicom graphical output is handled by x11 postscript svg or z buffer terminals the last one allowing output graphics plots to be saved in raster graphics formats gdl features integrated debugging facilities such as breakpoints gdl has a python bridge python code can be called from gdl gdl can be compiled as a python module gdl uses eigen c library numerical library similar to intel mkl to have excellent computing performance on multi cores processors with better benchmark than idl on large matrix operations packaged versions of gdl are available

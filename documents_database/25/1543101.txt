the system analyzes calculates and documents deformations of sheet metal parts for example it provides the 3d coordinates of the component s surface as well as the distribution of major and minor strain on the surface and the material thickness reduction in the forming limit diagram the measured deformations are compared to the material characteristics the system supports optimization processes in sheet metal forming by means of the optical forming analysis with forming analysis system provides for precise and fast measurement of small and large components using a high scanning density forming analysis system operates independently of the material it can analyze components made from flat blanks tubes or other components manufactured by an internal high pressure forming process ihpf hydro forming the forming analysis system compares the 3d positions of measuring points in a flat and in a deformed state prior to the deformation a regular point pattern is applied to the surface of the measuring object for measuring objects which undergo high friction during the forming process the measuring points are applied for example with the help of electrolytic methods after the forming process of the measuring object a camera online or stand alone operation records the measuring

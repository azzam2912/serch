seasonal subseries plots involves the extraction of the seasons from a time series into a subseries based on a selected periodicity it is an alternative plot that emphasizes the seasonal patterns are where the data for each season are collected together in separate mini time plots seasonal subseries plots enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen clearly and also shows the changes in seasonality over time especially it allows to detect changes between different seasons changes within a particular season over time however this plot is only useful if the period of the seasonality is already known in many cases this will in fact be known for example monthly data typically has a period of 12 if the period is not known an autocorrelation plot or spectral plot can be used to determine it if there is a large number of observations then a box plot may be preferable seasonal sub series plots are formed by the horizontal line displays the mean value for each month over the time series the analyst must specify the length of the seasonal pattern before generating this plot in most cases the analyst will know this from the context of the problem and

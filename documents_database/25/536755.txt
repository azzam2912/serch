the pseudo arc is an arc like homogeneous continuum and played a central role in the classification of homogeneous planar continua r h bing proved that in a certain well defined sense most continua in r n 2 are homeomorphic to the pseudo arc in 1920 bronis aw knaster and kazimierz kuratowski asked whether a nondegenerate homogeneous continuum in the euclidean plane r must be a jordan curve in 1921 stefan mazurkiewicz asked whether a nondegenerate continuum in r that is homeomorphic to each of its nondegenerate subcontinua must be an arc in 1922 knaster discovered the first example of a hereditarily indecomposable continuum k later named the pseudo arc giving a negative answer to a mazurkiewicz question in 1948 r h bing proved that knaster s continuum is homogeneous i e for any two of its points there is a homeomorphism taking one to the other yet also in 1948 edwin moise showed that knaster s continuum is homeomorphic to each of its non degenerate subcontinua due to its resemblance to the fundamental property of the arc namely being homeomorphic to all its nondegenerate subcontinua moise called his example m a pseudo arc bing s construction is a modification

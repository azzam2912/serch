a transversion can be spontaneous or can be caused by ionizing radiation or alkylating agents it can only be reversed by a spontaneous reversion although there are two possible transversions but only one possible transition transition mutations are more likely than transversions because substituting a single ring structure for another single ring structure is more likely than substituting a double ring for a single ring also transitions are less likely to result in amino acid substitutions due to wobble base pair and are therefore more likely to persist as silent substitutions in populations as single nucleotide polymorphisms snps a transversion usually has a more pronounced effect than a transition because the third nucleotide codon position of the dna which to a large extent is responsible for the degeneracy of the code is more tolerant of transition than a transversion that is a transition is more likely to encode for the same amino acid 8 oxo 2 deoxyguanosine 8 oxodg is an oxidized derivative of deoxyguanosine and is one of the major products of dna oxidation during dna replication in the germ line of mice the oxidized base 8 oxoguanine 8 oxog causes spontaneous and heritable g to t transversion mutations

breaching experiments are most commonly associated with ethnomethodology and in particular the work of harold garfinkel breaching experiments involve the conscious exhibition of unexpected behavior violation of social norms an observation of the types of social reactions such behavioral violations engender and an analysis of the social structure that makes these social reactions possible the idea of studying the violation of social norms and the accompanying reactions has bridged across social science disciplines and is today used in both sociology and psychology the assumption behind this approach is not only that individuals engage daily in building up rules for social interaction but also that people are unaware they are doing so the work of sociologist erving goffman laid the theoretical foundation for ways to study the construction of everyday social meanings and behavioral norms especially by breaking unstated but universally accepted rules garfinkel expanded on this idea by developing ethnomethodology as a qualitative research method for social scientists later in the 1970s and 80s famous social psychologist stanley milgram developed two experiments to observe and quantify responses to breaches in social norms to empirically analyze reactions to violation of those norms goffman published two seminal works related to this domain

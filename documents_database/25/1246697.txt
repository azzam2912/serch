the game had a number of changes made to it which received mixed feedback from reviewers although gameplay is similar to the original there are notable differences between it and the wii version the first notable difference is that frank now operates from out of the mall s security room and that he advances the main plot of the game by completing missions given to him by otis brad and jessie others see him rescuing the various survivors of the outbreak while players do not have a single countdown clock for the entire story missions are individually timed and frank is not permitted to roam freely around the mall when on a mission another notable difference is that the game has a greater emphasis on gun based gameplay than the original firearms are a completely redefined element of the game not only do guns now have more ammunition to them players now use an over the shoulder perspective with frank with aiming which is further aided through the use of the wii remote to aim where the gun is pointing other differences between the two versions include on july 15 2008 famitsu revealed that dead rising was in the process

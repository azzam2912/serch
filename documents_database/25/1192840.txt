since 1913 gotha had been manufacturing a series of reconnaissance seaplanes for the imperial german navy initially patterned on the avro 503 these were intended as unarmed scouts but as world war i unfolded it became desirable to arm this type of aircraft in the days before the development of the interrupter gear the most effective way to mount a gun with a forward firing arc was to dispense with a conventional fuselage relocate the engine to the rear of a nacelle that also carried the cockpit weapons and wings and carry the tail on booms stretching back either side of the engine and propeller installation while gotha had built copies of the caudron g 3 as the ld 3 and ld 4 the resulting aircraft had more in common with the contemporary ago c i and c ii as similar molded booms were used instead of a lattice frame and the caudron used a tractor engine only a single prototype was built however and gotha s subsequent efforts would focus on other configurations

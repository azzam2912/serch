cavallini and others showed that lanthionine ketimine forms from alternative reactions of the transsulfuration pathway enzyme cystathionine synthase which normally condenses the amino acids homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine in an alternate pathway cysteine and serine or two equivalents of cysteine condense to form lanthionine the product of these transformations is lanthionine or cystathionine ketimine respectively additional sources of lanthionine ketimine have been proposed lanthionine ketimine also binds the brain protein lanthionine synthase like protein 1 lancl1 a glutathione binding protein of uncertain function it has been hypothesized but not proved that lancl1 might catalyze formation of glutathione lanthionine conjugates in a pathway leading to lanthionine ketimine lanthionine ketimine and a synthetic cell penetrating ester derivative called lanthionine ketimine 5 ethyl ester lke potentiate growth factor dependent extension of neuron processes neurites in cell culture this neurotrophic activity may occur through interaction of lanthionine ketimine with a protein called collapsin response protein 2 crmp2 also known as dihydropyrimidinase like protein 2 or dpysl2 normally crmp2 functions to promote or inhibit neurite growth lanthionine ketimine interacts with crmp2 in affinity proteomics experiments and alters crmp2 binding to other proteins in brain lysate preparations beside its neurotrophic effects lanthionine ketimine and

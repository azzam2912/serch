through the center of the sn runs the solitary tract a white bundle of nerve fibers including fibers from the facial glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves that innervate the sn the sn projects to among other regions the reticular formation parasympathetic preganglionic neurons hypothalamus and thalamus forming circuits that contribute to autonomic regulation cells along the length of the sn are arranged roughly in accordance with function for instance cells involved in taste are located in the rostrum part while those receiving information from cardio respiratory and gastrointestinal processes are found in the caudal part neurons that innervate the sn mediate the gag reflex the carotid sinus reflex the aortic reflex the cough reflex the baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes several respiratory reflexes and reflexes within the gastrointestinal system regulating motility and secretion neurons which transmit signals about the gut wall the stretch of the lungs and the dryness of mucous membranes also innervate the sn the first central neurons within the sn can participate in simple autonomic reflexes information goes from the solitary nucleus to a large number of other regions of the brain including the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the central nucleus of the amygdala as well as

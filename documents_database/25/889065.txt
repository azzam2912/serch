there are three types of forgery existential selective and universal besides the following attacks there is also a total break when adversary can compute the signer s private key and therefore forge any possible signature on any message existential forgery is the creation by an adversary of at least one message signature pair formula 5 where formula 2 was not produced by the legitimate signer the adversary need not have any control over formula 1 formula 1 need not have any particular meaning the message content is irrelevant as long as the pair formula 5 is valid the adversary has succeeded in constructing an existential forgery existential forgery is essentially the weakest adversarial goal therefore the strongest schemes are those that are existentially unforgeable take an algorithm like rsa with the multiplicative property this property can be exploited sending a message formula 11 with a signature formula 12 a common defense to this attack is to hash the messages before signing them selective forgery is the creation of a message signature pair formula 5 by an adversary where formula 1 has been chosen by the adversary prior to the attack formula 1 may be chosen to have interesting mathematical properties

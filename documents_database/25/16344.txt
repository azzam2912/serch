in a multimode fiber the lack of an equilibrium mode distribution could introduce errors in the measurement due to output coupling effects in a single mode fiber measuring a shorter cutback fiber could result in significant transmission of cladding modes light carried in the cladding rather than the core of the optical fiber distorting the measurement the errors introduced will result in conservative results i e higher transmission losses and lower bandwidths than would be realized under equilibrium conditions the benefit of this technique is that it allows measurement of the fiber characteristics without introducing errors due to variation in the launch conditions for example the coupling efficiency of the light source is kept consistent between the initial and the cutback measurements several characteristics may be determined using the same test fiber since the attenuation is defined as proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between formula 1 and formula 2 where formula 3 is the power at point formula 4 and formula 5 respectively using the cutback technique the power transmitted through a fiber of known length is measured and compared with the same measurement for the same fiber cut to a length of formula 6 approximately a variation

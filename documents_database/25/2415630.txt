when cells divide there are many internal or external factors that would lead to a stoppage of division this stoppage could be permanent or temporary and could occur in any one of the four cycle phases g1 s g2 and m depending on the status of cells or the activities they are undergoing during the process all cell duplication process including mitosis meiosis as well as dna replication will be paused the mechanisms involve the proteins and dna sequences inside cells permanent cell cycle withdrawal refers to the forever stoppage in divisions of cells in organisms cells do not divide endlessly certain mechanisms are present to prevent cells from indefinite division which is mostly done by programmed failure in dna synthesis by adapting the above mechanism cells are prevented from over dividing the process also enables cells to proceed to senescence which are further stages of cell life and growth the permanent cell cycle withdrawal is mainly done by the wearing off of dna sequences during s phase the second stage during a dna replication progress such progress occurs in the end sequences of the whole linear chromosome named telomeres telomeres are sequences of repetitive nucleotides which serve no genetic

the idea of geometric dop is to state how errors in the measurement will affect the final state estimation this can be defined as formula 1 conceptually you can geometrically imagine errors on a measurement resulting in the formula 2 term changing ideally small changes in the measured data will not result in large changes in output location as such a result would indicate the solution is very sensitive to errors the interpretation of this formula is shown in the figure to the right showing two possible scenarios with acceptable and poor gdop more recently the term has come into much wider usage with the development and adoption of gps neglecting ionospheric and tropospheric effects the signal from navigation satellites has a fixed precision therefore the relative satellite receiver geometry plays a major role in determining the precision of estimated positions and times due to the relative geometry of any given satellite to a receiver the precision in the pseudorange of the satellite translates to a corresponding component in each of the four dimensions of position measured by the receiver i e formula 3 formula 4 formula 5 and formula 6 the precision of multiple satellites in view of a

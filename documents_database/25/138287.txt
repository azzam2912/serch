as well as being one of the primary areas of research in set theory it has applications to other areas of mathematics such as functional analysis ergodic theory the study of operator algebras and group actions and mathematical logic descriptive set theory begins with the study of polish spaces and their borel sets a polish space is a second countable topological space that is metrizable with a complete metric heuristically it is a complete separable metric space whose metric has been forgotten examples include the real line formula 1 the baire space formula 2 the cantor space formula 3 and the hilbert cube formula 4 the class of polish spaces has several universality properties which show that there is no loss of generality in considering polish spaces of certain restricted forms because of these universality properties and because the baire space formula 2 has the convenient property that it is homeomorphic to formula 6 many results in descriptive set theory are proved in the context of baire space alone the class of borel sets of a topological space x consists of all sets in the smallest algebra containing the open sets of x this means that the borel sets of

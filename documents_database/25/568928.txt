polymorphism can potentially be found in any crystalline material including polymers minerals and metals and is related to allotropy which refers to chemical elements the complete morphology of a material is described by polymorphism and other variables such as crystal habit amorphous fraction or crystallographic defects polymorphism is relevant to the fields of pharmaceuticals agrochemicals pigments dyestuffs foods and explosives when polymorphism exists as a result of a difference in crystal packing it is called packing polymorphism polymorphism can also result from the existence of different conformers of the same molecule in conformational polymorphism in pseudopolymorphism the different crystal types are the result of hydration or solvation this is more correctly referred to as solvomorphism as different solvates have different chemical formulae an example of an organic polymorph is glycine which is able to form monoclinic and hexagonal crystals silica is known to form many polymorphs the most important of which are quartz quartz tridymite cristobalite moganite coesite and stishovite a classical example is the pair of minerals calcite and aragonite both forms of calcium carbonate an analogous phenomenon for amorphous materials is polyamorphism when a substance can take on several different amorphous modifications in terms of thermodynamics there are

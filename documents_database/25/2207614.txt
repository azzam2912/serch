in contrast to nuclear reactors where velocities of the coolant are no larger than a few meter per second and thus typical residence time is on seconds however in rockets chambers with subsonic velocities of the propellant around hundreds of meters per second residence time are around formula 1 to formula 2 and then a long power pulse translates into an important gain in energy in comparison with the stationary mode the gained energy by pulsing the nuclear core can be used for thrust amplification by increasing the propellant mass flow or using the intensive neutron flux to produce a very high specific impulse amplification even higher than the fission fragment rocket where in the pulsed rocket the final propellant temperature is only limited by the radiative cooling after the pulsation a rough calculation for the energy gain by using a pulsed thermal nuclear rocket in comparison with the conventional stationary mode is as follows the energy stored into the fuel after a pulsation is the sensible heat stored because the fuel temperature increase this energy may be written as where on the other hand the energy generated in the stationary mode i e when the nuclear core operates at

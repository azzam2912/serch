let the radii of these two circles be denoted as r and r respectively and let their respective centers be the points u and v the pappus chain consists of the circles in the shaded grey region which are externally tangent to c the inner circle and internally tangent to c the outer circle let the radius diameter and center point of the n circle of the pappus chain be denoted as r d and p respectively all the centers of the circles in the pappus chain are located on a common ellipse for the following reason the sum of the distances from the n circle of the pappus chain to the two centers u and v of the arbelos circles equals a constant thus the foci of this ellipse are u and v the centers of the two circles that define the arbelos these points correspond to the midpoints of the line segments ab and ac respectively if r ac ab then the center of the n th circle in the chain is if r ac ab then the radius of the n th circle in the chain is the height h of the center of the n circle

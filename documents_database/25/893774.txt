these syntheses take place in the adrenal cortex specifically 21 hydroxylase converts progesterone and 17 hydroxyprogesterone into 11 deoxycorticosterone and 11 deoxycortisol respectively by hydroxylating at the c21 position the products of the conversions then continue through their appropriate pathways towards creation of aldosterone and cortisol like other cytochrome p450 enzymes 21 hydroxylase participates in the cytochrome p450 catalytic cycle and engages in one electron transfer with nadph p450 reductase its structure includes an essential iron heme group centered within the protein also common to all p450 enzymes variations of the 21 hydroxylase enzyme can be found in all vertebrates however understanding of human 21 hydroxylase structure and function is of particular clinical value as a failure of the enzyme to act appropriately results in congenital adrenal hyperplasia the x ray crystal structure for human 21 hydroxylase with bound progesterone was realized and published in 2015 providing opportunity for further study the enzyme is notable for its substrate specificity and relatively high catalytic efficiency 21 hydroxylase is a complex of three independent and identical enzyme subunits each subunit in the human enzyme consists of 13 helices and 9 strands formed into a triangular prism like tertiary structure the iron iii

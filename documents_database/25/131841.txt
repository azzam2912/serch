joe grimm formerly of the detroit free press likened journalese to a stage voice we write journalese out of habit sometimes from misguided training and to sound urgent authoritative and well journalistic but it doesn t do any of that some people regard journalism with amusement as an often colourful use of language it is partly due to the need for brevity particularly in headlines and can therefore serve a useful purpose however one critic says that lazy writing goes with lazy thought and it is often a mark of a weak story with poor evidence or an attempt to dress up something as more significant or interesting journalese is like a poker player s tell it shows that the reporter knows the story is flimsy and he or she is trying to make it appear more solid other critics fault the use of the passive voice and similar constructions in journalese as a form of weasel wording that a writer chooses to hide the culprit of the action that the writer is describing subeditors copy editors on newspapers are trained to remove it and the new york times even has a customised spell checker that flags particularly egregious examples

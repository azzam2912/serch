this is different from the two separate focusing knobs seen on low level microscopes another common reason to employ a dual speed focuser is with the use of short focal length eyepieces where the depth of focus is short requiring critically accurate focusing a dual speed focusing mechanism is often combined with a crayford focuser forming a dual speed crayford focuser in order to eliminate backlash during fine focusing dual speed focuser design borrows the planetary gearing idea used in automobile gearboxes however in order to eliminate backlash balls and axles are used instead of gears all the transmission inside a dual speed focuser is achieved via static friction the cylinder case of a dual speed focuser is fixed on the telescope tube three metal balls are placed 120 apart inside the case in a holder shelf an input axle penetrates through the hole on the center of the holder shelf and is pushed and tightened by three surrounding balls the fine focusing knob connects to the input axle while the fast focusing knob connects to the holder shelf on the other side the axle from the crayford focuser is connected to the holder shelf when one rotates the fine

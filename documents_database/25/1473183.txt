suppose also that s is a compact surface with boundary that is properly embedded in m meaning that the boundary of s is a subset of the boundary of m and the interior points of s are a subset of the interior points of m a boundary compressing disk for s in m is defined to be a disk d in m such that formula 1 and formula 2 are arcs in formula 3 with formula 4 formula 5 and formula 6 is an essential arc in s formula 6 does not cobound a disk in s with another arc in formula 8 the surface s is said to be boundary compressible if either s is a disk that cobounds a ball with a disk in formula 9 or there exists a boundary compressing disk for s in m otherwise s is boundary incompressible alternatively one can relax this definition by dropping the requirement that the surface be properly embedded suppose now that s is a compact surface with boundary embedded in the boundary of a 3 manifold m suppose further that d is a properly embedded disk in m such that d intersects s in an essential arc one

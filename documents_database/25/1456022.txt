the purpose of the solar simulator is to provide a controllable indoor test facility under laboratory conditions used for the testing of solar cells sun screen plastics and other materials and devices the iec 60904 9 edition2 and astm e927 10 standards are a common specification for solar simulators used for photovoltaic testing the light from a solar simulator is controlled in three dimensions each dimension is classified in one of three classes a b or c the specifications required for each class are defined in table 1 below a solar simulator meeting class a specifications in all three dimensions is referred to as a class a solar simulator or sometimes a class aaa referring to each of the dimensions in the order listed above the solar simulation spectrum is further specified via the integrated irradiance across several wavelength intervals the percentage of total irradiance is shown below in table 2 for the standard terrestrial spectra of am1 5g and am1 5d and the extraterrestrial spectrum am0 these specifications were primarily intended for silicon photovoltaics and hence the spectral range over which the intervals were defined was limited mainly to the absorption region of silicon while this definition is also

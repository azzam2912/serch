the method is a member of the runge kutta family of ode solvers more specifically it uses six function evaluations to calculate fourth and fifth order accurate solutions the difference between these solutions is then taken to be the error of the fourth order solution this error estimate is very convenient for adaptive stepsize integration algorithms other similar integration methods are fehlberg rkf and cash karp rkck the dormand prince method has seven stages but it uses only six function evaluations per step because it has the fsal first same as last property the last stage is evaluated at the same point as the first stage of the next step dormand and prince chose the coefficients of their method to minimize the error of the fifth order solution this is the main difference with the fehlberg method which was constructed so that the fourth order solution has a small error for this reason the dormand prince method is more suitable when the higher order solution is used to continue the integration a practice known as local extrapolation dormand prince is currently the default method in the codice 1 solver for matlab and gnu octave and is the default choice for

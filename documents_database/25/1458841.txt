when distances of at least three locations are known a fourth position can be determined using trilateration optical trackers such as laser ranging trackers suffer from line of sight problems and their performance is adversely affected by ambient light and infrared radiation on the other hand they do not suffer from distortion effects in the presence of metals and can have high update rates because of the speed of light ultrasonic trackers have a more limited range because of the loss of energy with the distance traveled also they are sensitive to ultrasonic ambient noise and have a low update rate but the main advantage is that they do not need line of sight systems using radio waves such as the global navigation satellite system do not suffer ambient light but still need line of sight a spatial scan system uses optical beacons and sensors two categories can be distinguished by aiming the sensor at the beacon the angle between them can be measured with triangulation the position of the object can be determined the main advantage of an inertial sensing is that it does not require an external reference instead it measures rotation with a gyroscope or position with

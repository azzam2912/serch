mwp seeks to develop new scientific insights and knowledge through high altitude and record seeking glider flights with the goal of increasing overall flight safety and improving pilot training wind movement over terrain and ground obstacles can create wavelike wind formations which can reach up to the stratosphere in 1998 the pilots ren heise and klaus ohlmann founded the mwp a project for global classification research and analysis of orographically created wind structures e g chinook foehn mistral zonda the mwp is an independent non profit project of the scientific and meteorological section of the organisation scientifique et technique du vol voile ostiv and is supported by the f d ration a ronautique internationale fai the mwp was originally focused on achieving better understanding of the complex thermal and dynamic air movements in the atmosphere and using that knowledge to achieve ever greater long distance soaring flights as mwp gained greater awareness of the power inherent to mountain wave like structures in the atmosphere and their strong vertical airflows it became obvious that they presented great dangers to civil aviation in multiple ways therefore the focus of the mwp shifted to a more scientific approach to the airflow phenomena with

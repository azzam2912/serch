if is strictly positive this is equivalent to saying that the logarithm of the function is concave that is for all and examples of log concave functions are the 0 1 indicator functions of convex sets which requires the more flexible definition and the gaussian function similarly a function is log convex if it satisfies the reverse inequality for all and log concave distributions are necessary for a number of algorithms e g adaptive rejection sampling every distribution with log concave density is a maximum entropy probability distribution with specified mean and deviation risk measure d as it happens many common probability distributions are log concave some examples note that all of the parameter restrictions have the same basic source the exponent of non negative quantity must be non negative in order for the function to be log concave the following distributions are non log concave for all parameters note that the cumulative distribution function cdf of all log concave distributions is also log concave however some non log concave distributions also have log concave cdf s the following are among the properties of log concave distributions

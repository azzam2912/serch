it is one of the predominant methods for tabulating nuclear mass the mass of an atomic nucleus is well approximated less than 0 1 difference for most nuclides by its mass number which indicates that most of the mass of a nucleus arises from mass of its constituent protons and neutrons thus the mass excess is an expression of the nuclear binding energy relative to the binding energy per nucleon of carbon 12 which defines the atomic mass unit if the mass excess is negative the nucleus has more binding energy than c and vice versa if a nucleus has a large excess of mass compared to a nearby nuclear species it can radioactively decay releasing energy the c standard makes it useful to think about nuclear mass in atomic mass units for the definition of the mass excess however its usefulness arises in the calculation of nuclear reaction kinematics or decay only a small fraction of the total energy associated with atomic nuclei by mass energy equivalence on the order of 0 01 to 0 1 of the total mass may be absorbed or liberated as radiation thus by working in terms of the mass excess one has effectively

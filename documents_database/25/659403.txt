valid socket types in the unix domain are sock stream compare to tcp for a stream oriented socket sock dgram compare to udp for a datagram oriented socket that preserves message boundaries as on most unix implementations unix domain datagram sockets are always reliable and don t reorder datagrams and sock seqpacket compare to sctp for a sequenced packet socket that is connection oriented preserves message boundaries and delivers messages in the order that they were sent the unix domain socket facility is a standard component of posix operating systems the api for unix domain sockets is similar to that of an internet socket but rather than using an underlying network protocol all communication occurs entirely within the operating system kernel unix domain sockets may use the file system as their address name space some operating systems like linux offer additional namespaces processes reference unix domain sockets as file system inodes so two processes can communicate by opening the same socket in addition to sending data processes may send file descriptors across a unix domain socket connection using the codice 1 and codice 2 system calls this allows the sending processes to grant the receiving process access to a file

almost one third of the species in this tribe are placed in the genus senecio its members exhibit probably the widest possible range of form to be found in the entire plant kingdom and include annuals minute creeping alpines perennial herbs shrubs climbers succulents trees and semiaquatic plants plants in this tribe are responsible for more livestock poisonings than all other plants combined the poisons are particularly pyrrolizidine alkaloids in senecio and furanoeremophilanes in tetradymia a number of species are well known in horticulture since the time of bentham the premier systematic botanist of the nineteenth century considerable efforts have been made to classify and understand the striking morphological diversity in the senecioneae the traditional view of the tribe has been that of one huge genus senecio plus many other genera which exhibit varying degrees of distinctiveness circumscription and delimitation of the tribe have experienced expansions and contractions over the decades as genera and groups of genera have been moved in and out as was the case for arnica liabum munnozia schistocarpha etc which have since then been excluded of the several potential causes for this constant redefinition the greatest is probably that little is known about its intergeneric relationships

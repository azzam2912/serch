spatially close sets have nonempty intersection in other words spatially close sets are not disjoint sets since they always have at least one element in common descriptively close sets contain elements that have matching descriptions such sets can be either disjoint or non disjoint sets spatially near sets are also descriptively near sets the underlying assumption with descriptively close sets is that such sets contain elements that have location and measurable features such as colour and frequency of occurrence the description of the element of a set is defined by a feature vector comparison of feature vectors provides a basis for measuring the closeness of descriptively near sets near set theory provides a formal basis for the observation comparison and classification of elements in sets based on their closeness either spatially or descriptively near sets offer a framework for solving problems based on human perception that arise in areas such as image processing computer vision as well as engineering and science problems near sets have a variety of applications in areas such as topology pattern detection and classification abstract algebra mathematics in computer science and solving a variety of problems based on human perception that arise in areas such as

theoretically this multiplies the data rate by exactly the number of channels present dual channel memory employs two channels the technique goes back as far as the 1960s having been used in ibm system 360 model 91 and in cdc 6600 modern high end processors like the intel core i9 and amd ryzen threadripper series along with various xeons support quad channel memory in march 2010 amd released socket g34 and magny cours opteron 6100 series processors with support for quad channel memory in 2006 intel released chipsets that support quad channel memory for its lga771 platform and later in 2011 for its lga2011 platform microcomputer chipsets with even more channels were designed for example the chipset in the alphastation 600 1995 supports eight channel memory but the backplane of the machine limited operation to four channels dual channel enabled memory controllers in a pc system architecture use two 64 bit data channels dual channel should not be confused with double data rate ddr in which data exchange happens twice per dram clock the two technologies are independent of each other and many motherboards use both by using ddr memory in a dual channel configuration dual channel architecture requires a

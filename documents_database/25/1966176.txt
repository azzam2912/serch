the well defined central raised area or glabella excluding the backward occipital ring is as wide as long moderately convex truncate tapering with 3 pairs of shallow to obsolete lateral furrows the occipital ring is well defined the distance between the glabella and the border or preglabellar field is as long as the glabella eyes small to almost medium 12 20 of the length of the cephalon positioned between the front and the middle of the glabella and about as far out as the glabella is wide the remaining parts of the cephalon called fixed and free cheeks or fixigenae and librigenae are flat the fracture lines or sutures that in moulting separate the librigenae from the fixigenae are divergent just in front of the eyes becoming parallel near the border furrow and strongly convergent at the margin from the back of the eyes the sutures are bending out than in diverging outward and backward at approximately 45 cutting the posterior margin well within the inner bend of the spine or opisthoparian sutures the articulating middle part of the body or thorax has 12 segments the anteriormost segment gradually narrows into a sideward directed point while further to the back

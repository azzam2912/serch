nolisting is simply the adding of an mx record pointing to a non existent server as the primary i e that with the lowest preference value which means that an initial mail contact will always fail many spam sources don t retry on failure so the spammer will move on to the next victim while legitimate email servers should retry the next higher numbered mx and normal email will be delivered with only a small delay a simple example of mx records that demonstrate the technique this defeats spam programs that only connect to the highest priority lowest numbered mx and do not follow the standard error handling of retrying the next priority mx there are alternate techniques that suggest sandwiching the valid mx records between non responsive ones some variants also suggest configuring the highest numbered hosts to always return 4xx errors i e retry later a simple example of mx records that demonstrate the technique greylisting also relies on the fact that spammers often use custom software which will not persevere to deliver a message in the correct rfc compliant way

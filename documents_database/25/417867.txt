it is offered as an alternative to the ieee 802 1q standard a widely used vlan tagging protocol although the use of isl for new sites is deprecated by cisco with isl an ethernet frame is encapsulated with a header that transports vlan ids between switches and routers with ieee 802 1q the tag is internal this is a key advantage for ieee 802 1q as it means tagged frames can be sent over standard ethernet links isl does add overhead to the frame as a 26 byte header containing a 10 bit vlan id in addition a 4 byte crc is appended to the end of each frame this crc is in addition to any frame checking that the ethernet frame requires the fields in an isl header identify the frame as belonging to a particular vlan a vlan id is added only if the frame is forwarded out a port configured as a trunk link if the frame is to be forwarded out a port configured as an access link the isl encapsulation is removed the size of an ethernet encapsulated isl frame can be expected to start from 94 bytes and increase up to 1548 bytes because

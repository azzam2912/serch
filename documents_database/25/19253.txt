they are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several hours after an initial flash of gamma rays a longer lived afterglow is usually emitted at longer wavelengths x ray ultraviolet optical infrared microwave and radio the intense radiation of most observed grbs is thought to be released during a supernova or superluminous supernova as a high mass star implodes to form a neutron star or a black hole a subclass of grbs the short bursts appear to originate from the merger of binary neutron stars the cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may be the development of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars as a result of the massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision causing the entire crust of the star to shatter the sources of most grbs are billions of light years away from earth implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the sun will in its entire 10 billion year lifetime and extremely rare a few per galaxy

in its most simple conception the method of isotope dilution comprises the addition of known amounts of isotopically enriched substance to the analyzed sample mixing of the isotopic standard with the sample effectively dilutes the isotopic enrichment of the standard and this forms the basis for the isotope dilution method isotope dilution is classified as a method of internal standardisation because the standard isotopically enriched form of analyte is added directly to the sample in addition unlike traditional analytical methods which rely on signal intensity isotope dilution employs signal ratios owing to both of these advantages the method of isotope dilution is regarded among chemistry measurement methods of the highest metrological standing isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number all isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom the term isotope is formed from the greek roots isos equal and topos place meaning the same place thus the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table analytical application of the radiotracer method is a forerunner of isotope dilution this method was developed in the early 20th

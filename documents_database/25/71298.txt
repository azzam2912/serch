he was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by product of natural selection or from selection on other traits there is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations there is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations the dog was the first domesticated vertebrate and was established across eurasia before the end of the late pleistocene era well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals the archaeological and genetic data suggest that long term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks including donkeys horses new and old world camelids goats sheep and pigs was common given its importance to humans and its

however from a technical or practical point of view it may be regarded as a technique used to study matter by firing electrons at a sample and observing the resulting interference pattern this phenomenon is commonly known as wave particle duality which states that a particle of matter in this case the incident electron can be described as a wave for this reason an electron can be regarded as a wave much like sound or water waves this technique is similar to x ray and neutron diffraction electron diffraction is most frequently used in solid state physics and chemistry to study the crystal structure of solids experiments are usually performed in a transmission electron microscope tem or a scanning electron microscope sem as electron backscatter diffraction in these instruments electrons are accelerated by an electrostatic potential in order to gain the desired energy and determine their wavelength before they interact with the sample to be studied the periodic structure of a crystalline solid acts as a diffraction grating scattering the electrons in a predictable manner working back from the observed diffraction pattern it may be possible to deduce the structure of the crystal producing the diffraction pattern however the technique

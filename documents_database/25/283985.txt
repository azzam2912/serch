traditional techniques for micronization focus on mechanical means such as milling and grinding modern techniques make use of the properties of supercritical fluids and manipulate the principles of solubility the term micronization usually refers to the reduction of average particle diameters to the micrometer range but can also describe further reduction to the nanometer scale common applications include the production of active chemical ingredients foodstuff ingredients and pharmaceuticals these chemicals need to be micronized to increase efficacy traditional micronization techniques are based on friction to reduce particle size such methods include milling bashing and grinding a typical industrial mill is composed of a cylindrical metallic drum that usually contains steel spheres as the drum rotates the spheres inside collide with the particles of the solid thus crushing them towards smaller diameters in the case of grinding the solid particles are formed when the grinding units of the device rub against each other while particles of the solid are trapped in between methods like crushing and cutting are also used for reducing particle diameter but produce more rough particles compared to the two previous techniques and are therefore the early stages of the micronization process crushing employs hammer like tools to

this generalization consists primarily in defining a total order over the sequences often called strings in computer science of elements of a finite totally ordered set often called an alphabet there are several variants and generalizations of the lexicographical ordering one variant widely used in combinatorics orders subsets of a given finite set by assigning a total order to the finite set and converting subsets into increasing sequences to which the lexicographical order is applied another generalization defines an order on a cartesian product of partially ordered sets this order is a total order if and only if the factors of the cartesian product are totally ordered the word lexicographic is derived from lexicon the set of words that are used in some language and appear in dictionaries and encyclopedias the lexicographic order has thus been introduced for sorting the entries of dictionaries and encyclopedias this has been formalized in the following way consider a finite set often called alphabet which is totally ordered in dictionaries this is the common alphabet ordered by the alphabetical order in book indexes the alphabet is generally extended to all alphanumeric characters it is the object of a specific convention whether a digit is

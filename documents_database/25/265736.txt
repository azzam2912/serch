cyclopentadienyl ligands almost invariable bind to metals as pentahapto bonding mode the metal cyclopentadienyl interaction is typically drawn as a single line from the metal center to the center of the cp ring bis cyclopentadienyl complexes are called metallocenes a famous example of this type of complex is ferrocene fecp which has many analogues for other metals such as chromocene crcp cobaltocene cocp and nickelocene nicp when the cp rings are mutually parallel the compound is known as a sandwich complex this area of organometallic chemistry was first developed in the 1950s bent metallocenes are represented by compounds of the type mcpl some are catalysts for ethylene polymerization metallocenes are often thermally stable and find use as catalysts in various types of reactions mixed ligand cp complexes containing cp ligand and one or more other ligands they are more numerous one widely studied example is the fp dimer cpfe co monometallic compounds featuring only one cp ring are often known as half sandwich compounds or as piano stool compounds one example being cyclopentadienylmanganese tricarbonyl cpmn co all 5 carbon atoms of a cp ligand are bound to the metal in the vast majority of m cp complexes this bonding mode

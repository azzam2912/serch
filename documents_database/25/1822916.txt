in numerical simulation the schwarzschild metric can be distorted by almost arbitrary kinds of external energy momentum distribution however in exact analysis the mature method to distort the standard schwarzschild metric is restricted to the framework of weyl metrics all static axisymmetric solutions of the einstein maxwell equations can be written in the form of weyl s metric formula 1 from the weyl perspective the metric potentials generating the standard schwarzschild solution are given by where which yields the schwarzschild metric in weyl s canonical coordinates that vacuum weyl spacetimes such as schwarzschild respect the following field equations where formula 9 is the laplace operator eq 5 a is the linear laplace s equation that is to say linear combinations of given solutions are still its solutions given two solutions formula 10 to eq 5 a one can construct a new solution via formula 11 and the other metric potential can be obtained by let formula 13 and formula 14 while formula 15 and formula 16 refer to a second set of weyl metric potentials then formula 17 constructed via eqs 6 7 leads to the superposed schwarzschild weyl metric with the transformations one can obtain the superposed schwarzschild metric

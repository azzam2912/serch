it measures 91 kilometers in diameter and was named after british physicist osborne reynolds during the winter much frost accumulates it freezes out directly onto the surface of the permanent polar cap which is made of water ice covered with layers of dust and sand the deposit begins as a layer of dusty co2 frost over the winter it recrystallizes and becomes denser the dust and sand particles caught in the frost slowly sink by the time temperatures rise in the spring the frost layer has become a slab of semi transparent ice about 3 feet thick lying on a substrate of dark sand and dust this dark material absorbs light and causes the ice to sublimate turn directly into a gas eventually much gas accumulates and becomes pressurized when it finds a weak spot the gas escapes and blows out the dust speeds can reach 160 km 100 miles per hour dark channels can sometimes be seen they are called spiders the surface appears covered with dark spots when this process is occurring these features can be seen in some of the pictures below

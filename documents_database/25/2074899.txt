the electronic personal dosimeter has the advantages over older types that it has a number of sophisticated functions such as continuous monitoring which allows alarm warnings at preset levels and live readout of dose accumulated it can be reset to zero after use and most models allow near field electronic communications for automatic reading and resetting they are typically worn on the outside of clothing such as on the chest or torso to represent dose to the whole body this location monitors exposure of most vital organs and represents the bulk of body mass these are especially useful in high dose areas where residence time of the wearer is limited due to dose constraints pin diodes are used to quantify the radiation dose for military and personnel applications mosfet dosimeters are now used as clinical dosimeters for radiotherapy radiation beams the main advantages of mosfet devices are 1 the mosfet dosimeter is direct reading with a very thin active area less than 2 m 2 the physical size of the mosfet when packaged is less than 4 mm 3 the post radiation signal is permanently stored and is dose rate independent gate oxide of mosfet which is conventionally silicon dioxide

based on the elements of common germanic vocabulary and syntax which do not seem to have cognates in other indo european languages it claims that proto germanic may have been either a creole or a contact language that subsumed a non indo european substrate language or a hybrid of two quite different indo european languages mixing the centum and satem types the non indo european substrate theory was first proposed by sigmund feist in 1932 who estimated that roughly a third of proto germanic lexical items came from a non indo european substrate and that the supposed reduction of the proto germanic inflectional system was the result of pidginization with that substrate which culture or cultures may have contributed the substrate material is an ongoing subject of academic debate and study notable candidates for possible substrate culture s include the maglemosian nordwestblock and funnelbeaker culture but also older cultures of northern europe like the hamburgian or even the lincombian ranisian jerzmanowician culture the non indo european substrate hypothesis attempts to explain the anomalous features of proto germanic as a result of creolization between an indo european and a non indo european language germanicist john a hawkins sets forth the arguments

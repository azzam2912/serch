in it the discrete laplace operator takes the place of the laplace operator the discrete poisson equation is frequently used in numerical analysis as a stand in for the continuous poisson equation although it is also studied in its own right as a topic in discrete mathematics using the finite difference numerical method to discretize the 2 dimensional poisson equation assuming a uniform spatial discretization formula 1 on an m n grid gives the following formula where formula 3 and formula 4 the preferred arrangement of the solution vector is to use natural ordering which prior to removing boundary elements would look like this will result in an mn mn linear system where formula 8 is the m m identity matrix and formula 9 also m m is given by and formula 11 is defined by for each formula 13 equation the columns of formula 9 correspond to a block of formula 15 components in formula 16 while the columns of formula 8 to the left and right of formula 9 each correspond to other blocks of formula 15 components within formula 16 and respectively from the above it can be inferred that there are formula 24 block columns of

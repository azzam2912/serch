it is a 12 amino acid polypeptide having the amino acid sequence arg val asp pro val asn phe lys leu leu ser his and is an n terminal extended form of hemopressin a 9 aa polypeptide derived from the subunit of hemoglobin which has previously been shown to act as a cb inverse agonist all three polypeptides have been isolated from various mammalian species with rvd hp being one of the more abundant neuropeptides expressed in mouse brain and these neuropeptides represent a new avenue for cannabinoid research distinct from the previously known endogenous lipid derived cannabinoid agonists such as anandamide recently it was shown that rvd hp also called pepcan 12 is a potent negative allosteric modulator at cb receptors together with other newly described n terminally extended peptides pepcans pepcan 12 is the major peptide of a family of endogenous peptide endocannabinoids pepcans shown to act as negative allosteric modulators nam of cannabinoid cb1 receptors it is shown that pepcan 12 opposite acts as a potent cb2 cannabinoid receptor positive allosteric modulator pam this peptide is very specifically expressed in the noradrenergic neurons in the brain mainly the locus coeruleus and its projections and in the adrenal

c21orf62 is found on human chromosome 21 and it is thought to be expressed in tissues of the brain and reproductive organs additionally c21orf62 is highly expressed in ovarian surface epithelial cells during normal regulation but is not expressed in cancerous ovarian surface epithelial cells common aliases of c21orf62 are c21orf120 pred81 and b37 c21orf62 is located on chromosome 21 in humans and is specifically at the q22 11 position the c21orf62 gene is 4132 base pairs in length and contains five exons the mrna sequence of c21orf62 in humans has one known isoform this isoform is called uncharacterized protein c21orf62 isoform x1 this isoform is 458 base pairs or 104 amino acids in length and it is significantly shorter than the most observed sequence of c21orf62 in humans in addition to having an isoform c21orf62 also has splice variants all splice variants encode the same gene but the differences in splice variant sequences occur in the 5 untranslated region of the mrna sequence the c21orf62 protein in humans has a sequence that is 219 amino acids in length the primary sequence of c21orf62 in humans has a molecular weight of 24 9 kda and an isoelectric point of 8

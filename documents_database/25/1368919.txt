a quorum based technique is implemented to enforce consistent operation in a distributed system quorum based voting can be used as a replica control method as well as a commit method to ensure transaction atomicity in the presence of network partitioning in a distributed database system a transaction could be executing its operations at multiple sites since atomicity requires every distributed transaction to be atomic the transaction must have the same fate commit or abort at every site in case of network partitioning sites are partitioned and the partitions may not be able to communicate with each other this is where a quorum based technique comes in the fundamental idea is that a transaction is executed if the majority of sites vote to execute it every site in the system is assigned a vote v let us assume that the total number of votes in the system is v and the abort and commit quorums are v and v respectively then the following rules must be obeyed in the implementation of the commit protocol the first rule ensures that a transaction cannot be committed and aborted at the same time the next two rules indicate the votes that a transaction

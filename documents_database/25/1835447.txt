it is a pathogenic ascomycete fungus that causes oak leaf blister disease on various species of oak trees quercus sp the associated anamorph species is lalaria coccinea described in 1990 this disease causes lesions and blisters on oak leaves effects of the disease are mostly cosmetic although not taxonomically defined strains of t caerulescens have been shown to be host specific with varying ascus morphology between strains there are differences in strains abilities to metabolize various carbon and nitrogen compounds this has been proposed as a method of taxonomically defining subspecies within t caerulescens t caerulescens is very closely related to taphrina deformans which causes peach leaf curl these two pathogens have indistinguishable asci however t deformans infects peach tree species while t caerulescens infects oak tree species only taphrina caerulescens infects about 50 different species of oak quercus predominately red oak q eruthrobalanus and some white oak q leurobalanus oak leaf blister is found across the country and in varying parts of the world but is most severe in the south east and gulf states of the u s it is generally accepted that a t caerulescens strain isolated from one host cannot be used to infect a different

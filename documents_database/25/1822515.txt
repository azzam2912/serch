the imperforate shell has a conical shape it is black or purplish black the 6 to 7 whorls are concave longitudinally somewhat obliquely plicated the plicae more or less project at the suture and on the edge of the basal whorl producing an undulating or crenulated effect otherwise sculptured by incremental striae which traverse the surface and cross the plicae at right angles the base of the shell is concave radiately closely and prominently striated more conspicuous flattened coalescing and sinuously curving at the edge commencing at the point where the outer lip joins the body whorl a shallow groove follows parallel to the periphery and extends toward the aperture without interrupting the basal sculpture the oblique aperture is subangulate black rimmed and crenulated on the thin edge of the outer lip it is nacreous silvery white toward the edge bright lustrous golden yellow within and around the umbilical region which latter though deeply pitted is not open the white columella has a callus and is arcuated with a moderately developed rib bounding the umbilical depression and terminating in a single tubercle this rib is paralleled by a shallow furrow terminating in a notch just below the tubercle and by

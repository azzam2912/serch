caissons are constructed in such a way that the water can be pumped out keeping the work environment dry when piers are being built using an open caisson and it is not practical to reach suitable soil friction pilings may be driven to form a suitable sub foundation these piles are connected by a foundation pad upon which the column pier is erected borrowed from french caisson from italian cassone meaning large box an augmentative of cassa shallow caissons may be open to the air whereas pneumatic caissons which penetrate soft mud are sealed at the top and filled with compressed air to keep water and mud out at depth an airlock allows access to the chamber workers move mud and rock debris called muck from the edge of the workspace to a water filled pit connected by a tube called the muck tube to the surface a crane at the surface removes the soil with a clamshell bucket the water pressure in the tube balances the air pressure with excess air escaping up the muck tube the pressurized air flow must be constant to ensure regular air changes for the workers and prevent excessive inflow of mud or water

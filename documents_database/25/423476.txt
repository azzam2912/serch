categories with all finite products and exponential objects are called cartesian closed categories categories such as subcategories of top without adjoined products may still have an exponential law let formula 1 be a category let formula 2 and formula 3 be objects of formula 1 and let formula 1 have all binary products with formula 3 an object formula 7 together with a morphism formula 8 is an exponential object if for any object formula 9 and morphism formula 10 there is a unique morphism formula 11 called the transpose of formula 12 such that the following diagram commutes this assignment of a unique formula 13 to each formula 12 establishes an isomorphism of hom sets formula 15 if formula 7exists for all objects formula 17 in formula 1 then the functor formula 19 defined on objects by formula 20 and on arrows by formula 21 is a right adjoint to the product functor formula 22 for this reason the morphisms formula 13 and formula 12 are sometimes called exponential adjoints of one another alternatively the exponential object may be defined through equations the exponential formula 30 is given by a universal morphism from the product functor formula 22 to

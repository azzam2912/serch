the curved design of the dam is optimum for the narrow gorge in which it was built to retain water in the reservoir arch dams are thin and require less material to construct than other dam types when the dam was built the decision was made to use the dam to store and regulate water only and not to provide energy construction started on the dam in 1968 and finished in 1972 the dam is 134 m 440 ft high and 52 3 m 171 6 ft wide at the foundation the reservoir capacity is 424 000 000 m 344 000 acre feet it is a double curvature concrete arch buttress design monitoring of the dam revealed abnormal movement although dams normally move the left side of the el atazar dam was moving more than the right because a support built on the dam s right made that side less flexible in 1977 a crack was noticed in the dam by 1979 the crack had grown to 46 m 150 ft in length and was repaired inspection in 1983 revealed that the settling in the foundations and the movements of the dam had caused fracturing in the rock resulting in

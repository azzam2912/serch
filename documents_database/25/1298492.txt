a narrow region of a crystal is melted with a powerful co or yag laser the laser and hence the floating zone is moved along the crystal the molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it this technique for growing crystals from the melt liquid solid phase transition is used in materials research the main advantages of this technique are the high pulling rates 60 times greater than the conventional czochralski technique and the possibility of growing materials with very high melting points in addition lhpg is a crucible free technique which allows single crystals to be grown with high purity and low stress the geometric shape of the crystals the technique can produce small diameters and the low production cost make the single crystal fibers scf produced by lhpg suitable substitutes for bulk crystals in many devices especially those that use high melting point materials however single crystal fibers must have equal or superior optical and structural qualities compared to bulk crystals to substitute for them in technological devices this can be achieved by carefully controlling the growth conditions until 1980 laser heated crystal growth used only two

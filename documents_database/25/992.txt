this can be stated symbolically as formula 1 the process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation or indefinite integration and its opposite operation is called differentiation which is the process of finding a derivative antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through the fundamental theorem of calculus the definite integral of a function over an interval is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval the discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is antidifference the function formula 2 is an antiderivative of formula 3 as the derivative of formula 4 is formula 5 as the derivative of a constant is zero formula 5 will have an infinite number of antiderivatives such as formula 7 etc thus all the antiderivatives of formula 5 can be obtained by changing the value of in formula 9 where is an arbitrary constant known as the constant of integration essentially the graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are vertical translations of each other each graph s vertical location depending upon the value more generally the power function formula 10 has antiderivative formula 11 if and formula 12 if in physics the integration of acceleration

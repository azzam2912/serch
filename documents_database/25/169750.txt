the living protoplasm of a cell is sometimes called the bioplasm and distinct from the ergastic substances of the cell the latter are usually organic or inorganic substances that are products of metabolism and include crystals oil drops gums tannins resins and other compounds that can aid the organism in defense maintenance of cellular structure or just substance storage ergastic substances may appear in the protoplasm in vacuoles or in the cell wall reserve carbohydrate of plants are the derivatives of the end products of photosynthesis cellulose and starch are the main ergastic substances of plant cells cellulose is the chief component of the cell wall and starch occurs as a reserve material in the protoplasm starch as starch grains arise almost exclusively in plastids especially leucoplasts and amyloplasts although proteins are the main component of living protoplasm proteins can occur as inactive ergastic bodies in an amorphous or crystalline or crystalloid form a well known amorphous ergastic protein is gluten fats lipids and oils are widely distributed in plant tissues substances related to fats waxes suberin and cutin occur as protective layers in or on the cell wall animals eliminate excess inorganic materials plants mostly deposit such material in

stress fields are widely used in fluid dynamics and materials science consider that one can picture the stress fields as the stress created by adding an extra half plane of atoms to a crystal the bonds are clearly stretched around the location of the dislocation and this stretching causes the stress field to form atomic bonds farther and farther away from the dislocation centre are less and less stretched which is why the stress field dissipates as the distance from the dislocation centre increases each dislocation within the material has a stress field associated with it the creation of these stress fields is a result of the material trying to dissipate mechanical energy that is being exerted on the material by convention these dislocations are labelled as either positive or negative depending on whether the stress field of the dislocation is mostly compressive or tensile by modelling of dislocations and their stress fields as either a positive compressive field or negative tensile field charges we can understand how dislocations interact with each other in the lattice if two like fields come in contact with one another they will be repelled by one another on the other hand if two opposing

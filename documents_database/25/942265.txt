several of the classes of the euryarchaeota are methanogens and the methanobacteria are one of these classes methanobacteria can be used in biomass conversion as well as energy production through anaerobic digestion ad process microbial community is used in anaerobic digestion ad to convert organic wastes into clean energy by reducing chemical and biological oxygen demand in the wastes solid state anaerobic digestion which contains six genera of methanogens including methanobacteria can ferment rice straw and then produce methane since conventional treatment is burning rice straw in field applying methanobacteria to waste disposal process can reduce the air pollution caused by straw burning and also alleviate energy shortage problem especially in rural areas during biomethanation process insoluble organic material and higher molecular mass compounds will first be transformed into simple carbon compounds these break down products will then be fermented to acetic acid hydrogen and carbon dioxide eventually the acetic acids can be fermented by different methanogenic bacteria to produce methane the product of methanobacteria in human body can be used to test diseases methane in breath is produced by anaerobic methanobacteria in human colon as a metabolic end product the status of methanobacteria product detected in breath tests can

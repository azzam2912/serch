anoxic depolarization is induced by the loss of neuronal selective membrane permeability and the ion gradients across the membrane that are needed to support neuronal activity normally the na k atpase pump maintains the transmembrane gradients of k and na ions but with anoxic brain injury the supply of energy to drive this pump is lost the hallmarks of anoxic depolarization are increased concentrations of extracellular k ions intracellular na and ca ions and extracellular glutamate and aspartate glutamate and aspartate are normally present as the brain s primary excitatory neurotransmitters but high concentrations activate a number of downstream apoptotic and necrotic pathways this results in neuronal dysfunction and death neurons function in the central nervous system by generating signals from synapses and this only works in the proper chemical environment an electrical signal is mediated by the sodium channels and leaky potassium channels in which intracellular k ion concentration is higher than its corresponding extracellular concentration whereas extracellular concentrations of na ca and cl ions are higher than the corresponding intracellular concentrations this uneven distribution of ions is maintained by the na k atpase pump which actively pumps na out and k into the cell in a ratio of

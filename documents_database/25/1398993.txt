he is known for his contributions to the fields of motor control motor learning and computational neuroscience sandro mussa ivaldi obtained a degree laurea in physics from the university of torino 1978 and a phd in biomedical engineering from the politecnico di milano 1987 he was a postdoctoral fellow and principal research scientist in the department of brain and cognitive sciences at the mit he is now professor of physiology physical medicine and rehabilitation and biomedical engineering at northwestern university he is the founder and director of the robotics laboratory in the rehabilitation institute of chicago mussa ivaldi s research combines experimental methods with the application of computational principles his experimental work has been influential for the study of arm biomechanics and in particular motor learning in human subjects he has also studied motor primitives in the frog s spinal cord that are a central issue in many theories of motor control sandro mussa ivaldi s theoretical work has focused on the analysis of redundant kinematics in human subjects he has asked how a variety of movement patterns and control strategies can be constructed from the superposition of a set of basis fields of particular theoretical importance is his discovery

it caused a large tsunami that flooded the southwestern coast of the island there are no reliable records of the loss of life with the casualties being described only as numerous the magnitude of this event has been estimated using records of uplift taken from coral microatolls the island of sumatra lies on the convergent plate boundary between the indo australian plate and the eurasian plate the convergence between these plates is highly oblique near sumatra with the displacement being accommodated by near pure dip slip faulting along the subduction zone known as the sunda megathrust and near pure strike slip faulting along the great sumatran fault the major slip events on the subduction zone interface are typically of megathrust type historically great or giant megathrust earthquakes have been recorded in 1797 1833 1861 2004 2005 and 2007 most of them being associated with devastating tsunamis smaller but still large megathrust events have also occurred in the small gaps between the areas that slip during the larger events in 1935 1984 2000 and 2002 there is only sparse information available regarding the extent of damage associated with either the earthquake or the subsequent tsunami however the tsunami was clearly devastating

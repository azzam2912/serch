torsion is expressed in either the pascal pa an si unit for newtons per square metre or in pounds per square inch psi while torque is expressed in newton metres n m or foot pound force ft lbf in sections perpendicular to the torque axis the resultant shear stress in this section is perpendicular to the radius in non circular cross sections twisting is accompanied by a distortion called warping in which transverse sections do not remain plane for shafts of uniform cross section unrestrained against warping the torsion is where the shear stress at a point within a shaft is note that the highest shear stress occurs on the surface of the shaft where the radius is maximum high stresses at the surface may be compounded by stress concentrations such as rough spots thus shafts for use in high torsion are polished to a fine surface finish to reduce the maximum stress in the shaft and increase their service life the angle of twist can be found by using calculation of the steam turbine shaft radius for a turboset assumptions the angular frequency can be calculated with the following formula the torque carried by the shaft is related to

there are various types of check valves used in a wide variety of applications check valves are often part of common household items although they are available in a wide range of sizes and costs check valves generally are very small simple or inexpensive check valves work automatically and most are not controlled by a person or any external control accordingly most do not have any valve handle or stem the bodies external shells of most check valves are made of plastic or metal an important concept in check valves is the cracking pressure which is the minimum differential upstream pressure between inlet and outlet at which the valve will operate typically the check valve is designed for and can therefore be specified for a specific cracking pressure heart valves are essentially inlet and outlet check valves for the heart ventricles since the ventricles act as pumps cracking pressure refers to the minimum pressure differential needed between the inlet and outlet of the valve at which the first indication of flow occurs steady stream of bubbles cracking pressure is also known as unseating head pressure or opening pressure reseal pressure refers to the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet

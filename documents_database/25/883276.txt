typically glucans form a linear backbone with 1 3 glycosidic bonds but vary with respect to molecular mass solubility viscosity branching structure and gelation properties causing diverse physiological effects in animals at dietary intake levels of at least 3 g per day oat fiber glucan decreases blood levels of ldl cholesterol and so may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases glucans are used as texturing agents in various nutraceutical and cosmetic products and as soluble fiber supplements but can be problematic in the process of brewing cereal and fungal products have been used for centuries for medicinal and cosmetic purposes however the specific role of glucan was not explored until the 20th century glucans were first discovered in lichens and shortly thereafter in barley a particular interest in oat glucan arose after a cholesterol lowering effect from oat bran reported in 1981 in 1997 the fda approved of a claim that intake of at least 3 0 g of glucan from oats per day decreased absorption of dietary cholesterol and reduced the risk of coronary heart disease the approved health claim was later amended to include these sources of glucan rolled oats oatmeal oat bran whole oat flour oatrim the

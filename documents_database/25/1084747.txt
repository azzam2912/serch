they are related to t regulatory cells and the signals that cause t17s to differentiate actually inhibit treg differentiation however t17s are developmentally distinct from t1 and t2 lineages t17 cells play an important role in maintaining mucosal barriers and contributing to pathogen clearance at mucosal surfaces such protective and non pathogenic th17 cells have been call treg17 cells they have also been implicated in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders the loss of t17 cell populations at mucosal surfaces has been linked to chronic inflammation and microbial translocation these regulatory th17 cells are generated by tgf beta plus il 6 in vitro like conventional regulatory t cells treg induction of regulatory treg17 cells could play an important role in modulating and preventing certain autoimmune diseases treg17 regulatory th17 cells are generated from cd4 t cells transforming growth factor beta tgf interleukin 6 il 6 interleukin 21 il 21 and interleukin 23 il 23 contribute to t17 formation in mice and humans key factors in the differentiation of t17 cells are signal transducer and the activator of transcription 3 stat3 and retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptors gamma ror and alpha ror t17 cells are differentiated when naive t cells are exposed

labour rate variance is the difference between the standard cost and the actual cost paid for the actual number of hours labour efficiency variance is the difference between the standard labour hour that should have been worked for the actual number of units produced and the actual number of hours worked when the labour hours are valued at the standard rate difference between the amount of labor time that should have been used and the labor that was actually used multiplied by the standard rate for example assume that the standard cost of direct labor per unit of product a is 2 5 hours x 14 35 assume further that during the month of march the company recorded 4500 hours of direct labor time the actual cost of this labor time was 64 800 or an average of 14 40 per hour the company produced 2000 units of product a during the month the labor efficiency variance is 4500 5000 x 14 7000 where 5000 hours 2 5 hours x 2000 units of output this variance is favorable since the actual hours used are less than the standard hours allowed this may be the result of efficient use of labor

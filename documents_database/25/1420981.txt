any hard or friable materials can be ground with low value of metal waste this type of mill is combined with a classifier for fine tuning of a product size mill uses for hard and friable materials wood most metals and plastics are inoperable raw material must be dry capacity strongly depends on characteristics of material and a product size a schematic drawing of a vsi mill is shown at fig 1 raw material particles transports via hopper 1 into the accelerator 2 an accelerator 2 rotates with a high speed and particles increase their speed by a centrifugal force after leaving channels of the accelerator particles impact with a wear plate 3 in the grinding chamber a high speed impact leads to destruction of particles into pieces of different size big particles greater than 1 mm fall down to outlet 5 and later they transport to hopper by an elevator other particles less than 1 mm lift by air stream into a classifier where blades 4 make rotating dust flow middle size particles shift to wall by centrifugal force in a big chamber of a classifier and fall down to cone 6 and later they move into an accelerator

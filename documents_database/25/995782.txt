other non coding rnas uncovered in the same analysis include spef ybhl meta and serc several studies in sinorhizobium meliloti showed that suhb element is indeed a non coding rna firstly it was detected on northern blot and called sm8rna secondly in an rnaseq study referred to as smelc689 the mutant phenotype s strain lacking the small rna cytoplasm contains higher content of polyhydroxybutyrate pbh storage granules than wild type strain the srna is required to limit the pbh intracellular accumulation when the nitrogen fixing sinorhizobium meliloti is under condition of surplus carbon in relation to nitrogen it has been renamed to mmgr further study confirmed that mmgr fine tunes the regulation of pbh storage northern blot confirmed the expression of the srna in other rhizobia species mmgr homologues were found in most alpha proteobacteria the rho independent terminator and a single stranded region 10 mer uuuccucccu are completely conserved hence it was proposed to define a new family of alpha proteobacterial srna alpha r8 of which mmgr is a member rna binding protein hfq is binding and stabilising mmgr expression of the mmgr gene was shown to be controlled by nitrogen n further study has shown that the regulatory

the family held over 400 species in over 70 genera and were the source of much taxonomic confusion two families were split out initially the cisticolas into cisticolidae and the kinglets into regulidae in the past ten years they have been the subject of much research and many species are now placed into other families including the acrocephalidae cettiidae phylloscopidae and megaluridae in addition some species have been moved into existing families or have not yet had their placement fully resolved a smaller family of warblers together with some babblers formerly placed in the family timaliidae and the parrotbills are retained in a much smaller family sylviidae most old world warblers are of generally undistinguished appearance though some asian species are boldly marked the sexes are often identical but may be clearly distinct notably in the genus sylvia they are of small to medium size varying from 9 to 16 centimetres in length with a small finely pointed bill almost all species are primarily insectivorous although some will also eat fruit nectar or tiny seeds the majority of species are monogamous and build simple cup shaped nests in dense vegetation they lay between two and six eggs per clutch depending

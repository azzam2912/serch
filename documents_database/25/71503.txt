an integer is even if it is divisible by two and odd if it is not even for example 6 is even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2 by contrast 3 5 7 21 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2 examples of even numbers include 4 0 82 and 178 in particular zero is an even number some examples of odd numbers are 5 3 29 and 73 a formal definition of an even number is that it is an integer of the form n 2 k where k is an integer it can then be shown that an odd number is an integer of the form n 2 k 1 it is important to realize that the above definition of parity applies only to integer numbers hence it cannot be applied to numbers like 1 2 or 4 201 see the section higher mathematics below for some extensions of the notion of parity to a larger class of numbers or in other more general settings the sets of even and odd numbers can be defined as following a number i e integer expressed in the decimal numeral system is even or odd

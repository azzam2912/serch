it provides structured methods for achieving efficiency and elegance in interface design several broad disciplines including psychology human factors and cognitive science subsume usability engineering but the theoretical foundations of the field come from more specific domains human perception and action human cognition behavioral research methodologies and to a lesser extent quantitative and statistical analysis techniques when usability engineering began to emerge as a distinct area of professional practice in the mid to late 1980s many usability engineers had a background in computer science or in a sub field of psychology such as perception cognition or human factors today these academic areas still serve as springboards for the professional practitioner of usability engineering but cognitive science departments and academic programs in human computer interaction now also produce their share of practitioners in the field the term usability engineering in contrast to interaction design and user experience design implies more of a focus on assessing and making recommendations to improve usability than it does on design however usability engineers may still engage in design to some extent particularly through the design of wire frames or other prototypes usability engineers sometimes work to shape an interface such that it adheres to accepted

this track which typically forms a loop is often compared to smaller racecourses it is however strictly designed for testing the layout of its environment imitates motorway circumstances in most cases handling courses consist of two parts low and high speed courses both enable the same types of tests only at differing speeds handling courses may also be categorised either as wet or dry courses according to the availability of the option for track wetting the alternative routes of the handling courses provide diverse track options for the tests as the course sections have varying radius of curvature handling courses are suitable for testing all vehicles types several types of specially paved shorter sections may also belong to handling courses depending on the given proving ground these may be curved straight or even wavy asphalt track sections furthermore straight or curving sections with varying sideway slopes occasionally even degraded surfaces requiring maintenance are built deliberately in order to increase the number of options furthermore sections suitable for conducting aquaplaning tests may also be inserted the option of wetting of the latter sections is usually provided by using nozzles the safety of testing is ensured b the crash spaces designed around

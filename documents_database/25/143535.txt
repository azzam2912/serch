it is one of the ten most speciose animal families as of 2015 although their body shapes and coloring vary somewhat most are shiny black or metallic and have ridged wing covers elytra the elytra are fused in some species particularly large carabinae rendering the beetles unable to fly the genus mormolyce is known as violin beetles due to their peculiarly shaped elytra all carabids except the quite primitive flanged bombardier beetles paussinae have a groove on their foreleg tibiae bearing a comb of hairs used for cleaning their antennae typical for the ancient beetle suborder adephaga to which they belong they have paired pygidial glands in the lower back of the abdomen these are well developed in ground beetles and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would be predators in some commonly known as bombardier beetles these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion producing a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas which can injure small mammals such as shrews and is liable to kill invertebrate predators outright to humans getting bombed by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience this ability has evolved independently

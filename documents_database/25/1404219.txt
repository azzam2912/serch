crew scheduling becomes more and more complex as you add variables to the problem these variables can be as simple as 1 location 1 skill requirement 1 shift of work and 1 set roster of people in the transportation industries such as rail or mainly air travel these variables become very complex in air travel for instance there are numerous rules or constraints that are introduced these mainly deal with legalities relating to work shifts and time and a crew members qualifications for working on a particular aircraft add numerous locations to the equation and collective bargaining and federal labor laws and these become new considerations for the problem solving method fuel is also a major consideration as aircraft and other vehicles require a lot of costly fuel to operate finding the most efficient route and staffing it with properly qualified personnel is a critical financial consideration the same applies to rail travel the problem is computationally difficult and there are competing mathematical methods of solving the problem although not easy to describe in one sentence the goal is the essentially same for any method of attacking the problem within a set of constraints and rules move a set roster

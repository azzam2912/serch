r kaprekar which produces a sequence of numbers which either converges to a constant value or results in a repeating cycle the algorithm is as follows for example in base 10 if we start with 3524 then we get a sequence like this is sometimes called a kaprekar sequence and the function is the kaprekar mapping some numbers map to themselves for instance if 0 then 0 0 0 if 495 then 954 459 495 if 6174 then 7641 1467 6174 these are the fixed points of the kaprekar mapping if the sequence reaches one of these numbers it will repeat indefinitely all kaprekar sequences will either reach one of these fixed points or will result in a repeating cycle either way the end result is reached in a fairly small number of steps note that the numbers and have the same digit sum and hence the same remainder modulo 9 if we are using base 10 therefore each number in a kaprekar sequence of base 10 numbers other than possibly the first is a multiple of 9 in the general case of base the numbers in the sequences will be multiples of in 1949 d r kaprekar discovered that

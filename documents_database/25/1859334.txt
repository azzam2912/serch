conversely they are said to be in parallel if the strain of the ensemble is their common strain and the stress of the ensemble is the sum of their stresses any combination of hookean linear response springs in series or parallel behaves like a single hookean spring the formulas for combining their physical attributes are analogous to those that apply to capacitors connected in series or parallel in an electrical circuit the following table gives formulas for the spring that is equivalent to a system of two springs in series or in parallel whose spring constants are formula 1 and formula 2 the compliance formula 3 of a spring is the reciprocal formula 4 of its spring constant

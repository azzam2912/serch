the case k 1 is dirichlet s theorem two other special cases are well known conjectures there are infinitely many twin primes n and 2 n are primes and there are infinitely many sophie germain primes n and 1 2 n are primes dickson s conjecture is further extended by schinzel s hypothesis h given n polynomials with positive degrees and integer coefficients n can be any natural number that each satisfy all three conditions in the bunyakovsky conjecture and for any prime p there is an integer x such that the values of all n polynomials at x are not divisible by p then there are infinitely many positive integers x such that all values of these n polynomials at x are prime for example if the conjecture is true then there are infinitely many positive integers x such that x 1 3 x 1 and x x 41 are all prime when all the polynomials have degree 1 this is the original dickson s conjecture this more general conjecture is the same as the generalized bunyakovsky conjecture

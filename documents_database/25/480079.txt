it is visible to the naked eye with a combined apparent visual magnitude of 4 19 based upon an annual parallax shift of 10 73 mas as seen from the earth it is located around 300 light years from the sun the pair are drawing nearer to the sun with a radial velocity of 10 57 km s this system forms a detached single lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 39 5 days and a low eccentricity of 0 04 its binary nature was discovered in 1899 by american astronomer w w campbell and the first orbital determination was made in 1910 by canadian astronomer j s plaskett the orbital plane is nearly aligned with the line of sight to the earth so the pair forms an eclipsing binary the primary eclipse has a minimum of 4 23 in magnitude while the secondary minimum is magnitude 4 21 this eclipsing behavior was discovered by german astronomer p guthnick using observations between 1946 and 1947 the primary is an evolved g type giant star with a stellar classification of g5 iii the secondary is a main sequence star with a class in the range a8 f0 v one of

although less efficient thin film cells and organic polymer based cells can be produced quickly and cheaply they are also flexible and can be stitched onto fabric according to an article from new scientist researchers have built a pv cell in the layers around a fiber creating a tiny cylindrical cell no longer limited to rooftops and poles solar collection could work silently and unobtrusively from everyday objects flexible solar cells can be used in humanitarian aid a makeshift shelter developed by powerfilm inc called the powershade can generate one kilowatt of power this could help a power emergency equipment at short notice in remote places konarka technologies produce a thin film polymer based pv cell as a flexible film stitched onto a fabric the ability to make these cells even smaller is dependent on further research into nanocrystal pv cells in theory nanotechnology could provide a way to expand the range of photons a cell could collect increasing its efficiency while becoming smaller konarka in partner with other institutions is working on this shadeplex is currently developing a product that integrates thin film photovoltaic modules with architectural fabrics they will feature a high power output 200 w 500 w

categorical red blue green real number 1 68 5 1 7e 6 odd number 1 3 5 etc the data type is a fundamental component of the semantic content of the variable and controls which sorts of probability distributions can logically be used to describe the variable the permissible operations on the variable the type of regression analysis used to predict the variable etc the concept of data type is similar to the concept of level of measurement but more specific for example count data require a different distribution e g a poisson distribution or binomial distribution than non negative real valued data require but both fall under the same level of measurement a ratio scale various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement the psychophysicist stanley smith stevens defined nominal ordinal interval and ratio scales nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values and permit any one to one transformation ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values but have a meaningful order to those values and permit any order preserving transformation interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined but the zero value is arbitrary as in the case with longitude

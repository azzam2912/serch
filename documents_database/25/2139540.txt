on the one hand unobserved heterogeneity can play a crucial role when it comes to different sampling methods such as stock or flow sampling on the other hand duration models have also been extended to allow for different subpopulations with a strong link to mixture models many of these models impose the assumptions that heterogeneity is independent of the observed covariates it has a distribution that depends on a finite number of parameters only and it enters the hazard function multiplicatively one can define the conditional hazard as the hazard function conditional on the observed covariates and the unobserved heterogeneity in the general case the cumulative distribution function of t associated with the conditional hazard is given by f t x v under the first assumption above the unobserved component can be integrated out and we obtain the cumulative distribution on the observed covariates only i e g t x f t x h d where the additional parameter parameterizes the density of the unobserved component v now the different estimation methods for stock or flow sampling data are available to estimate the relevant parameters a specific example is described by lancaster assume that the conditional hazard is given by

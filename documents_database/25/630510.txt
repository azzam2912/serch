the driving reaction may be nuclear fission or nuclear fusion or a multi stage cascading combination of the two though to date all fusion based weapons have used a fission device to initiate fusion and a pure fusion weapon remains a hypothetical device atmospheric nuclear explosions are associated with mushroom clouds although mushroom clouds can occur with large chemical explosions it is possible to have an air burst nuclear explosion without those clouds nuclear explosions produce radiation and radioactive debris the first man made nuclear explosion occurred on july 16 1945 at 5 50 am on the trinity test site near alamogordo new mexico in the united states an area now known as the white sands missile range the event involved the full scale testing of an implosion type fission atomic bomb in a memorandum to the u s secretary of war general leslie groves describes the yield as equivalent to 15 000 to 20 000 tons of tnt following this test a uranium gun type nuclear bomb little boy was dropped on the japanese city of hiroshima on august 6 1945 with a blast yield of 15 kilotons and a plutonium implosion type bomb fat man on nagasaki on

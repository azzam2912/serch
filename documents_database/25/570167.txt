the theoretical monoisotopic mass of a molecule is computed by taking the sum of the accurate masses of the primary isotope of each atom in the molecule for small molecules made up of low atomic number elements the monoisotopic mass is observable as an isotopically pure peak in a mass spectrum this differs from the nominal molecular mass which is the sum of the mass number of the primary isotope of each atom in the molecule and is an integer it also is different from the molar mass which is a type of average mass for some atoms like carbon oxygen hydrogen nitrogen and sulfur the mmi of these elements is exactly the same as the mass of its natural isotope which is the lightest one however this does not hold true for all atoms iron s most common isotope has a mass number of 56 while the stable isotopes of iron vary in mass number from 54 to 58 monoisotopic mass is typically expressed in unified atomic mass units u also called daltons da nominal mass is a term used in high level mass spectrometric discussions it can be calculated using the mass number of the most abundant isotope

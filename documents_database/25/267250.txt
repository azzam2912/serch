oxaloacetic acid in the form of its conjugate base oxaloacetate is a metabolic intermediate in many processes that occur in animals it takes part in gluconeogenesis the urea cycle the glyoxylate cycle amino acid synthesis fatty acid synthesis and the citric acid cycle oxaloacetic acid undergoes successive deprotonations to give the dianion at high ph the enolizable proton is ionized the enol forms of oxaloacetic acid are particularly stable so much so that the two tautomer have different melting points 152 c for the cis isoform and 184 c for the trans isoform oxaloacetate forms in several ways in nature a principal route is upon oxidation of l malate catalysed by malate dehydrogenase in the citric acid cycle malate is also oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase in a slow reaction with the initial product being enol oxaloacetate it also arises from the condensation of pyruvate with carbonic acid driven by the hydrolysis of atp occurring in the mesophyll of plants this process proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate catalysed by pyruvate carboxylase oxaloacetate can also arise from trans or de amination of aspartic acid oxaloacetate is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle where it reacts with acetyl coa to form citrate catalysed by

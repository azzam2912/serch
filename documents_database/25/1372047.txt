it was proposed in 2007 by david arthur and sergei vassilvitskii as an approximation algorithm for the np hard k means problem a way of avoiding the sometimes poor clusterings found by the standard k means algorithm it is similar to the first of three seeding methods proposed in independent work in 2006 by rafail ostrovsky yuval rabani leonard schulman and chaitanya swamy the distribution of the first seed is different the k means problem is to find cluster centers that minimize the intra class variance i e the sum of squared distances from each data point being clustered to its cluster center the center that is closest to it although finding an exact solution to the k means problem for arbitrary input is np hard the standard approach to finding an approximate solution often called lloyd s algorithm or the k means algorithm is used widely and frequently finds reasonable solutions quickly however the k means algorithm has at least two major theoretic shortcomings the k means algorithm addresses the second of these obstacles by specifying a procedure to initialize the cluster centers before proceeding with the standard k means optimization iterations with the k means initialization the algorithm

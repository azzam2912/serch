elfin is a 3u cubesat designed to study space weather specifically the loss of relativistic electrons in the radiation belts elfin was a participant in the air force research lab s university nanosatellite program and is currently funded by nasa s low cost access to space program and the national science foundation elfin carries a fluxgate magnetometer as well as two energetic particle detectors one for ions and one for electrons and aims to understand the loss mechanisms of relativistic killer electrons by providing pitch angle resolved energetic particle measurements the principal investigator of the project is vassilis angelopoulos elfin and elfin are part of nasa s elana 18 elfin launched with icesat 2 in september of 2018 from vandenberg air force base they are tracked with norad cat id of 43617 elfin a and 43616 elfin b elfin l is a collaboration mission between ucla and moscow state university the institute of geophysics and planetary physics igpp at ucla delivered the elfin instruments for the lomonosov russian university satellite the satellite launched on 28 april 2016 electron losses and fields investigation with spatio temporal ambiguity resolution elfin star or elfin option was awarded and executed in november 2017 which

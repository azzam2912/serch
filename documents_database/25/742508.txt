using a kernel the originally linear operations of pca are performed in a reproducing kernel hilbert space recall that conventional pca operates on zero centered data that is where formula 2 is the vector of one of the formula 3 multivariate observations it operates by diagonalizing the covariance matrix in other words it gives an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix which can be rewritten as to understand the utility of kernel pca particularly for clustering observe that while n points cannot in general be linearly separated in formula 7 dimensions they can almost always be linearly separated in formula 8 dimensions that is given n points formula 2 if we map them to an n dimensional space with it is easy to construct a hyperplane that divides the points into arbitrary clusters of course this formula 12 creates linearly independent vectors so there is no covariance on which to perform eigendecomposition explicitly as we would in linear pca instead in kernel pca a non trivial arbitrary formula 12 function is chosen that is never calculated explicitly allowing the possibility to use very high dimensional formula 12 s if we never have to actually evaluate the data in that space since

this program takes pre determined variants listed in a data file that contains the nucleotide change and its position and predicts if the variants are deleterious this program was first created by pablo cingolani to predict effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in drosphila and is now widely used at many universities such as harvard university uc berkeley stanford university etc snpeff has been used for various applications from personalized medicine at stanford university to profiling bacteria this annotation and prediction software can be compared to annovar and variant effect predictor but each use different nomenclatures snpeff has the capability to work on windows unix or mac systems although the installation steps differ for all systems snpeff is first downloaded as a zip file decompressed and then copy pasted into the desired software windows or requires an additional command line unix and mac once the software is installed the user inputs a vcf or txt file into the tool kit that contains the tab separated columns chromosome name position variant s id reference genome alternative quality score quality filter and information the chromosome name and position columns describe where the variant is located chromosome number and nucleotide position if the

a random variable formula 1 is said to be truncated from below if for some threshold value formula 2 the exact value of formula 1 is known for all cases formula 4 but unknown for all cases formula 5 similarly truncation from above means the exact value of formula 1 is known in cases where formula 7 but unknown when formula 8 truncation is similar to but distinct from the concept of statistical censoring a truncated sample can be thought of as being equivalent to an underlying sample with all values outside the bounds entirely omitted with not even a count of those omitted being kept with statistical censoring a note would be recorded documenting which bound upper or lower had been exceeded and the value of that bound with truncated sampling no note is recorded usually the values that insurance adjusters receive are either left truncated right censored or both for example if policyholders are subject to a policy limit u then any loss amounts that are actually above u are reported to the insurance company as being exactly u because u is the amount the insurance company pays the insurer knows that the actual loss is greater than

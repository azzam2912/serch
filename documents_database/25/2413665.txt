the framework is used by over a hundred device drivers in openbsd to export various environmental sensors with temperature sensors being the most common type consumption and monitoring of sensors is done in the userland with the help of sysctl systat sensorsd ntpd snmpd ports sysutils symon and gkrellm in openbsd the framework is integrated with dell s esm ipmi and i c in addition to a number of popular super i o chips through a major difference compared to other solutions like lm sensors is simplicity and a works by default approach in the drivers which don t require nor support any configurability no installation or configuration actions are required by the system administrator in order to get the sensors going this is coupled with a fine tuned ad hoc read only scan procedure on the i c bus written by theo de raadt in a centralised way with a cache making it possible to leave it enabled by default at all times unlike the competing solutions support for automatic monitoring of raid drives is also provided through the sensors framework this concept of sensors of codice 1 type has been backported by netbsd back into envsys in openntpd

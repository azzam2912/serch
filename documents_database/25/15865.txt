in microbiology the process of electroporation is often used to transform bacteria yeast or plant protoplasts by introducing new coding dna if bacteria and plasmids are mixed together the plasmids can be transferred into the bacteria after electroporation though depending on what is being transferred cell penetrating peptides or cellsqueeze could also be used electroporation works by passing thousands of volts across a distance of one to two millimeters of suspended cells in an electroporation cuvette 1 0 1 5 kv 250 750 v cm afterwards the cells have to be handled carefully until they have had a chance to divide producing new cells that contain reproduced plasmids this process is approximately ten times more effective than chemical transformation electroporation is also highly efficient for the introduction of foreign genes into tissue culture cells especially mammalian cells for example it is used in the process of producing knockout mice as well as in tumor treatment gene therapy and cell based therapy the process of introducing foreign dna into eukaryotic cells is known as transfection electroporation is highly effective for transfecting cells in suspension using electroporation cuvettes electroporation has proven efficient for use on tissues in vivo for in utero applications

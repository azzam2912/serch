j mahony he published on model equations for long waves in non linear dispersive systems known as benjamin bona mahony equation he is probably best known for his statement about equivalent statements of the axiom of choice the axiom of choice is obviously true the well ordering theorem is obviously false and who can tell about zorn s lemma jerry bona has worked at university of chicago pennsylvania state university university of texas at austin and is a professor of mathematics at the university of illinois at chicago in 2012 he became a fellow of the american mathematical society in 2013 he became a fellow of the society for industrial and applied mathematics this is a joke although the three are all mathematically equivalent many mathematicians find the axiom of choice to be intuitive the well ordering principle to be counterintuitive and zorn s lemma to be too complex for any intuition

rhythmic contemporary never uses rock or country in its airplay but it may occasionally use a reggae latin reggaeton or a christian gospel hit essentially the format is a cross between mainstream radio and urban contemporary radio formats although some top 40 stations such as cklw in windsor detroit made their mark by integrating a large amount of r b and soul product into their predominantly pop playlists as early as 1967 such stations were still considered mainstream top 40 a cycle that continues to dominate the current top 40 chr chart it was not until the disco era of the late 1970s that such stations came to be considered as a format of their own as opposed to top 40 or soul this development was largely spurred by the highly successful worst to first debut of the disco based format on wktu on 92 3 fm in new york city now wnyl in 1978 that station was classified as disco but actually played a blend of disco dance music and pop crossovers at that time stations playing strictly r b tracks were known as black or soul stations stations such as wktu came to be known as urban contemporary

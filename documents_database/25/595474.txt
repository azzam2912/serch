more precisely formula 1 is a parent of formula 2 in the ordered graph formula 3 if formula 4 and formula 5 the width of a node is the number of its parents and the width of an ordered graph is the maximal width of its nodes the induced graph of an ordered graph is obtained by adding some edges to an ordering graph using the method outlined below the induced width of an ordered graph is the width of its induced graph given an ordered graph its induced graph is another ordered graph obtained by joining some pairs of nodes that are both parents of another node in particular nodes are considered in turn according to the ordering from last to first for each node if two of its parents are not joined by an edge that edge is added in other words when considering node formula 1 if both formula 2 and formula 8 are parents of it and are not joined by an edge the edge formula 9 is added to the graph since the parents of a node are always connected with each other the induced graph is always chordal as an example the induced graph

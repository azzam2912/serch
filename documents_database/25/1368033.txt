although data books specify an upper limit of 400 600 mhz some circuits may obtain gain up to about 900 mhz interelectrode capacitances and miller capacitances are minimized by the small dimensions of the device and the widely separated pins the connecting pins are placed around the periphery of the bulb and project radially outward this maintains short internal leads with low inductance an important property allowing operation at high frequency the pins fit a special socket fabricated as a ceramic ring in which the valve itself occupies the central space the 955 was developed by rca and was commercially available in 1935 the 955 is one of about a dozen types of acorn valve so called because their size and shape is similar to the acorn nut of the oak tree introduced starting in 1935 and designed to work in the vhf range the 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut off pentodes respectively both also with indirect 6 3 v 150 ma heaters types 957 958 and 959 are for portable equipment and have 1 25 v nicd battery heaters the 957 is a medium signal triode the 958 is a transmitting triode with dual paralleled

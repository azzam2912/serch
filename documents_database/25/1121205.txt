the west half of the mapped area between long 100 and 190 w is dominated by older craters and by intercrater plains material that lies between and within them younger crater materials intermediate plains material and small patches of smooth plains material are superposed on all other units the crater verdi in diameter is the largest of the younger craters its extensive ejecta blanket and secondary crater field are superposed on plains materials and older craters the east half of the mapped area between long 0 and 100 w is characterized by smooth plains material murray and others 1974 this unit covers vast expanses of borealis planitia a depression about in diameter that has an irregular arcuate west boundary this depression is located over the site s of one or several old impact structures boyce and grolier 1977 in the borealis region mariner 10 images are available for only the western hemisphere from long 0 to about long 190 w mercury was in darkness beyond long 190 w on march 29 1974 when the first mariner 10 flyby acquired the most useful photographs of the region most of the photographs used for geologic mapping were acquired by the departing spacecraft

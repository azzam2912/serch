the fast hammer action breaks hard rock into small flakes and dust and is blown clear by the air exhaust from the dth hammer the dth hammer is one of the fastest ways to drill hard rock now smaller portable drillcat drilling rigs with dth hammers can drill as fast as much larger truck rigs with this newer technology the system is thought to have been invented independently by stenuick fr res in belgium and ingersoll rand in the usa in the mid 1950s a pneumatic tool is first thought to have been used for rock drilling in 1844 many quarries used hand held tools that required the driller to suspend himself from a rope over the quarry face in order to place the drill hole in the required position this system used small diameter holes and was not only terribly inefficient but very dangerous due to flying rock as a result of the inaccuracy of the drilled borehole some quarries used primitive top hammer machines that carried the jack hammer on a mast the slenderness of the drill rods working with a relatively large diameter drill bit caused bore holes to deviate which sometimes meant that a bore hole

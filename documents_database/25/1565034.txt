solids do not react together at room temperature over normal time scales and it is necessary to heat them to much higher temperatures often to 1000 to 1500 c in order for the reaction to occur at an appreciable rate the factors on which the feasibility and rate of a solid state reaction depend include reaction conditions structural properties of the reactants surface area of the solids their reactivity and the thermodynamic free energy change associated with the reaction these are the solid reactants from which it is proposed to prepare a solid crystalline compound the selection of reactant chemicals depends on the reaction conditions and expected nature of the product the reactants are dried thoroughly prior to weighing as increase in surface area enhances the reaction rate fine grained materials should be used if possible after the reactants have been weighed out in the required amounts they are mixed for manual mixing of small quantities usually an agate mortar and pestle are employed sufficient amount of some volatile organic liquid preferably acetone or alcohol is added to the mixture to aid homogenization this forms a paste which is mixed thoroughly during the process of grinding and mixing the organic

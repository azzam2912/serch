in earth s atmosphere such particles interact with air nuclei and produce various other particles these effect particles called an air shower can be detected and measured but since these high energy particles have an estimated arrival rate of just 1 per km per century the auger observatory has created a detection area of the size of rhode island or luxembourg in order to record a large number of these events it is located in the western mendoza province argentina near the andes construction began in 2000 the observatory has been taking production grade data since 2005 and was officially completed in 2008 the northern site was to be located in southeastern colorado united states and hosted by lamar community college it also was to consist of water cherenkov detectors and fluorescence telescopes covering the area of 10 370 km 3 3 times larger than auger south the observatory was named after the french physicist pierre victor auger the project was proposed by jim cronin and alan watson in 1992 today more than 500 physicists from nearly 100 institutions around the world are collaborating to maintain and upgrade the site in argentina and collect and analyse the measured data the

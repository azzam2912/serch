it is in diameter and was named after the brothers paul henry and prosper henry both of whom were french telescope makers and astronomers henry crater has a large mound in its center that shows layers in certain parts the layers can be a few meters thick or tens of meters think recent research on these layers by scientists at california institute of technology caltech suggest that ancient climate change on mars caused by regular variation in the planet s tilt or obliquity may have caused the patterns in the layers on earth similar changes astronomical forcing of climate results in ice age cycles in a recent study of layers in craters in western arabia much was learned about the layers each layer may average under 4 meters in one crater but 20 meters in another although the craters in this study are just outside the boundary for the arabia quadrangle the findings would probably apply to the arabia quadrangle as well the pattern of layers within layers measured in becquerel crater suggests that each layer was formed over a period of about 100 000 years moreover every 10 layers were bundled together into larger units the 10 layer pattern

in magnetosphere science and seismology alternative definitions are usually given including ranges from 1 mhz to 100 hz 1 mhz to 1 hz and 10 mhz to 10 hz frequencies above 3 hz in atmospheric science are usually assigned to the elf range many types of waves in the ulf frequency band can be observed in the magnetosphere and on the ground these waves represent important physical processes in the near earth plasma environment the speed of the ulf waves is often associated with the alfv n velocity that depends on the ambient magnetic field and plasma mass density this band is used for communications in mines as it can penetrate the earth some monitoring stations have reported that earthquakes are sometimes preceded by a spike in ulf activity a remarkable example of this occurred before the 1989 loma prieta earthquake in california although a subsequent study indicates that this was little more than a sensor malfunction on december 9 2010 geoscientists announced that the demeter satellite observed a dramatic increase in ulf radio waves over haiti in the month before the magnitude 7 0 2010 earthquake researchers are attempting to learn more about this correlation to find out whether

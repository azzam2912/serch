these blocks were developed in india and were first adopted for the breakwaters of the krishnapatnam port along the east coast of india kolos has been conceptualized by incorporating structural improvements to existing armour units dolos the common failure modes for dolos were found to be either at the shank due to torsion and at the fluke by bending induced shear the higher structural stresses are caused largely due to the longer lever arm the elongated shank length of the dolos was shrunken by 21 4 in kolos the material thus saved compensates for thickening the legs of kolos kolos is characterized by a central shorter concrete member and two outer elongate concrete members connected on opposites sides of the central member the outer members have parallel longitudinal axes extending normal to the longitudinal axis of the central member these members have an octagonal cross section and are further configured such that their cross sectional area decreases from its intermediate portion towards opposite ends thereof kolos are fabricated using plain cement concrete in order to fabricate kolos three piece steel moulds are used which facilitate easy de moulding de moulding is usually carried out after 24 hours of concrete casting

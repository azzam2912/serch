there are two main types of electric locking devices locking devices can be either fail safe or fail secure a fail secure locking device remains locked when power is lost fail safe locking devices are unlocked when de energized direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail safe typically the electromagnet portion of the lock is attached to the door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door the two components are in contact when the door is closed when the electromagnet is energized a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet creating a locking action because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress typical single door electromagnetic locks are offered in both 600 lbs 2669 n and 1200 lbs 5338 n dynamic holding force capacities a fail safe magnetic lock requires power to remain locked and typically is not suitable for high security applications because it is possible to disable the lock by disrupting the power supply despite this by adding a magnetic

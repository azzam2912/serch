this is the emitted component of radiosity the si unit of radiant exitance is the watt per square metre while that of spectral exitance in frequency is the watt per square metre per hertz w m hz and that of spectral exitance in wavelength is the watt per square metre per metre w m commonly the watt per square metre per nanometre the cgs unit erg per square centimeter per second is often used in astronomy radiant exitance is often called intensity in branches of physics other than radiometry but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity radiant exitance of a surface denoted m e for energetic to avoid confusion with photometric quantities is defined as where if we want to talk about the radiant flux received by a surface we speak of irradiance the radiant exitance of a black surface according to the stefan boltzmann law is equal to where so for a real surface the radiant exitance is equal to where is the emissivity of that surface spectral exitance in frequency of a surface denoted m is defined as where is the frequency spectral exitance in wavelength of a surface denoted m is defined as

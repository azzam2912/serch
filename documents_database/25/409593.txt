simple properties of the image which are found via image moments include area or total intensity its centroid and information about its orientation for a 2d continuous function f x y the moment sometimes called raw moment of order p q is defined as for p q 0 1 2 adapting this to scalar greyscale image with pixel intensities i x y raw image moments m are calculated by in some cases this may be calculated by considering the image as a probability density function i e by dividing the above by a uniqueness theorem hu 1962 states that if f x y is piecewise continuous and has nonzero values only in a finite part of the xy plane moments of all orders exist and the moment sequence m is uniquely determined by f x y conversely m uniquely determines f x y in practice the image is summarized with functions of a few lower order moments simple image properties derived via raw moments include central moments are defined as where formula 7 and formula 8 are the components of the centroid if x y is a digital image then the previous equation becomes the central moments of order up

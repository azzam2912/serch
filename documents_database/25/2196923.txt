a teacher wants to know whether to come to class or not there are n potential students for each student there is a probability of 1 n that the student will attend the class if at least one student attends then the teacher must come and his cost is 1 if no students attend then the teacher can stay at home and his cost is 0 the goal of the teacher is to minimize his cost this is a stochastic programming problem because the constraints are not known in advance only their probabilities are known now there are two cases regarding the correlation between the students the correlation gap is the cost in case 2 divided by the cost in case 1 which is formula 4 an upper bound on the correlation gap implies an upper bound on the loss that results from ignoring the correlation for example suppose we have a stochastic programming problem with a submodular cost function we know the marginal probabilities of the variables but we do not know whether they are correlated or not if we just ignore the correlation and solve the problem as if the variables are independent the resulting solution is a

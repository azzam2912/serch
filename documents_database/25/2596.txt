a compact space is a space in which every open cover of the space contains a finite subcover the methods of compactification are various but each is a way of controlling points from going off to infinity by in some way adding points at infinity or preventing such an escape consider the real line with its ordinary topology this space is not compact in a sense points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right it is possible to turn the real line into a compact space by adding a single point at infinity which we will denote by the resulting compactification can be thought of as a circle which is compact as a closed and bounded subset of the euclidean plane every sequence that ran off to infinity in the real line will then converge to in this compactification intuitively the process can be pictured as follows first shrink the real line to the open interval on the x axis then bend the ends of this interval upwards in positive y direction and move them towards each other until you get a circle with one point the topmost one missing this point is our new

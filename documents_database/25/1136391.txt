the axis of revolution passes through the hole and so does not intersect the surface for example when a rectangle is rotated around an axis parallel to one of its edges then a hollow rectangle section ring is produced if the revolved figure is a circle then the object is called a torus the term toroid is also used to describe a toroidal polyhedron in this context a toroid need not be circular and may have any number of holes a g holed toroid can be seen as approximating the surface of a torus having a topological genus g of 1 or greater the euler characteristic of a g holed toroid is 2 1 g a toroid is specified by the radius of revolution r measured from the center of the section rotated for symmetrical sections volume and surface of the body may be computed with circumference c and area a of the section which gives for square and circular sections the volume and surface of a toroid with square section of side a are given by the volume and surface of a toroid with circular section of radius r torus are given by

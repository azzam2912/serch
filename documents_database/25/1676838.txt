the mp pic method achieves greater stability than its particle in cell predecessor by simultaneously treating the solid particles as computational particles and as a continuum in the mp pic approach the particle properties are mapped from the lagrangian coordinates to an eulerian grid through the use of interpolation functions after evaluation of the continuum derivative terms the particle properties are mapped back to the individual particles this method has proven to be stable in dense particle flows computationally efficient and physically accurate this has allowed the mp pic method to be used as particle flow solver for the simulation of industrial scale chemical processes involving particle fluid flows the multiphase particle in cell mp pic method was originally developed for a one dimensional case in the mid 1990s by p j o rourke los alamos national laboratory who also coined the term mp pic subsequent extension of the method to two dimensions was performed by d m snider and o rourke by 2001 d m snider had extended the mp pic method to full three dimensions currently the mp pic method is used in commercial software for the simulation of particle fluid systems the mp pic method is described

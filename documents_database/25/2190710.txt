the formula is nibr the anion combines with cations to form a series of salts called tetrabromonickelates strongly coordinating solvents will displace one or more of the bromido ligands from the complex solvents that can dissolve tetrabromonickelate include acetone acetonitrile methyl ethyl ketone and nitromethane in the visible absorption spectrum there is a strong absorption band termed near 710 nm which is caused by an electronic transition from t f t p another strong absorption in the near infrared called near 770 nm is due to the t f a f transition dilithium tetrabromonickelate forms a dark blue solution in tetrahydrofuran a mixture of lithium bromide and nickel bromide in water or methanol can transfer nibr ions into a cyclohexane amine mixture the solution formed is green tetraethylammonium tetrabromonickelate is blue tetra n butylammonium tetrabromonickelate is purple blue in color melting around 83 c it is formed from nickel bromide and tetra n butylammonium bromide in ethyl alcohol tetraphenylphosphonium tetrabromonickelate ii can be made from nickel bromide triphenylphosphine and bromobenzene by heating them together in a sealed tube at 250 c this substance is dark blue if it is heated over 260 the color changes to green and it melts

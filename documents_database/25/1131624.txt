at the time the parallax estimate was which would suggest a distance of with a high margin of error in 2007 van leeuwen published a revised parallax measurement of which corresponds to a distance of with a smaller but still significant margin of error in 2018 the gaia spacecraft measured a parallax of which is a distance of with an error of only it has a spectral classification of k1ii iii making it a giant star that has evolved away from the main sequence the mass is 2 7 times the sun while measurements of the star s radius give estimates of 45 5 or 50 4 solar radii the atmosphere of the star displays short period radial velocity variations with a primary period of 4 89 days this behavior is typical for giant k type stars such as this and it is not the result of a close orbit planetary companion the star is possibly the most massive of all planet harboring stars hd 13189 b is an exoplanet or brown dwarf with mass ranges from 8 to 20 jupiter mass this object is located at a mean distance of 277 gm 1 85 au from the star taking

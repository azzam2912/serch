the sample size is an important feature of any empirical study in which the goal is to make inferences about a population from a sample in practice the sample size used in a study is usually determined based on the cost time or convenience of collecting the data and the need for it to offer sufficient statistical power in complicated studies there may be several different sample sizes for example in a stratified survey there would be different sizes for each stratum in a census data is sought for an entire population hence the intended sample size is equal to the population in experimental design where a study may be divided into different treatment groups there may be different sample sizes for each group sample sizes may be chosen in several ways larger sample sizes generally lead to increased precision when estimating unknown parameters for example if we wish to know the proportion of a certain species of fish that is infected with a pathogen we would generally have a more precise estimate of this proportion if we sampled and examined 200 rather than 100 fish several fundamental facts of mathematical statistics describe this phenomenon including the law of large

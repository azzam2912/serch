this protein belongs to the serpin serine protease inhibitor superfamily serpinb5 was originally reported to function as a tumor suppressor gene in epithelial cells suppressing the ability of cancer cells to invade and metastasize to other tissues furthermore and consistent with an important biological function maspin knockout mice were reported to be non viable dying in early embryogenesis however a subsequent study using viral transduction as a method of gene transfer rather than single cell cloning was not able to reproduce the original findings and found no role for maspin in tumour biology furthermore the latter study demonstrated that maspin knockout mice are viable and display no obvious phenotype these data are consistent with the observation that maspin is not expressed in early embryogenesis the precise molecular function of maspin is thus currently unknown maspin is expressed in the skin prostate testis intestine tongue lung and the thymus maspin is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine protease inhibitors the primary function of most members of this family is to regulate the breakdown of proteins by inhibiting the catalytic activity of proteinases through this mechanism of action serpins regulate a number of cellular processes including phagocytosis coagulation and fibrinolysis

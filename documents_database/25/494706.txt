this term is often used in many areas of science such as in atmospheric chemistry medicine and theoretical physics especially when cosmic inflation is investigated physicists and chemists often talk about the e folding time scale that is determined by the proper time in which the length of a patch of space or spacetime increases by the factor e mentioned above in finance the logarithmic return or continuously compounded return also known as force of interest is the reciprocal of the e folding time the term e folding time is also sometimes used similarly in the case of exponential decay to refer to the timescale for a quantity to decrease to 1 e of its previous value the process of evolving to equilibrium is often characterized by a time scale called the e folding time this time is used for processes which evolve exponentially toward a final state equilibrium in other words if we examine an observable x associated with a system temperature or density for example then after a time the initial difference between the initial value of the observable and the equilibrium value x will have decreased to x e where the number e 2 71828 formula 1

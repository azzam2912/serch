values are stated as neutron separation energy two neutron separation energy proton separation energy deuteron separation energy alpha separation energy and so on the lowest separation energy among stable nuclides is 1 67 mev to remove a neutron from beryllium 9 the energy can be added to the nucleus by an incident high energy gamma ray if the energy of the incident photon exceeds the separation energy a photodisintegration might occur energy in excess of the threshold value becomes kinetic energy of the ejected particle by contrast nuclear binding energy is the energy needed to completely disassemble a nucleus or the energy released when a nucleus is assembled from nucleons it is the sum of multiple separation energies which should add to the same total regardless of the order of assembly or disassembly electron separation energy or electron binding energy the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral atom or molecule or cation is called ionization energy the reaction leads to photoionization photodissociation the photoelectric effect photovoltaics etc bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break one bond of a molecule or ion usually separating an atom or atoms

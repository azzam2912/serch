such holes are formed when the water temperature in the clouds is below freezing but the water in a supercooled state has not frozen yet due to the lack of ice nucleation when ice crystals do form a domino effect is set off due to the bergeron process causing the water droplets around the crystals to evaporate this leaves a large often circular hole in the cloud it is thought that the introduction of large numbers of tiny ice crystals into the cloud layer sets off this domino effect of fusion which creates the hole the ice crystals can be formed by passing aircraft which often have a large reduction in pressure behind the wing or propeller tips this cools the air very quickly and can produce a ribbon of ice crystals trailing in the aircraft s wake these ice crystals find themselves surrounded by droplets and grow quickly by the bergeron process causing the droplets to evaporate and creating a hole with brush like streaks of ice crystals below it an early satellite documentation of elongated fallstreak holes over the florida panhandle that likely were induced by passing aircraft appeared in corfidi and brandli 1986 fallstreak holes are more

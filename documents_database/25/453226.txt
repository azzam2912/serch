the comic which debuted on 10 september 2004 and continued since on a semi weekly basis until going on indefinite hiatus per 20 june 2008 chronicled the bizarre and humorous escapades of steve a green reptilian creature and the eponymously named beaver the comic is light hearted in its tone favouring short self contained storylines with minimal continuity the brightly coloured artwork and loose drawing style is a reflection upon this whimsical nature the humour each comic ends on a joke is often of a visual form also frequent is humour derived from the juxtaposition of the absurd goings on in beaver and steve s world often caused by steve with the down to earth reactions of the characters often beaver a mainstay of the strip is the use of onomatopoeias sounds made in the world of the comic though it is common for comics to contain some sound effects such as the beep of a car horn this concept is far extended in the unfeasible adventures of beaver and steve many actions have their own sound effect including indifference from emotibot and cakey aroma from unsurprisingly a cake the beaver and steve archives contain a number of guest comics

hrpt transmissions are available around the world and are available from both polar and geostationary weather satellites the polar satellites rotate in orbits that allow each location on earth to be covered by the weather satellite twice per day while the geostationary satellites remain in one location at the equator taking weather images of the earth from that location over the equator the sensor on weather satellites that picks up hrpt is referred to as an advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr broadcast signal the working frequency band for hrpt is l band at 1 670 1 710 ghz and the modulation types are bpsk and qpsk on noaa klm satellites the transmission power is 6 35 watts or 38 03 dbm the metop a satellite broadcasts with a bandwidth of 4 5 mhz in order to receive hrpt transmissions a high gain antenna is required such as a small satellite dish a helical antenna or a crossed yagi basic reception equipment includes a parabolic dish antenna attached to an azimuth elevation unit the hrpt signal is further enhanced with a 1 7 ghz pre amplifier an hrpt receiver unit and a dish tracking controller are required to steer the

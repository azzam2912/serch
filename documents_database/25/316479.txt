the equation is a result of combining ideas of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics and is used to explain the spectral classification of stars the expression was developed by indian astrophysicist meghnad saha in 1920 and later 1923 by irving langmuir for a gas at a high enough temperature and or density the thermal collisions of the atoms will ionize some of the atoms making an ionized gas when several or more of the electrons that are normally bound to the atom in orbits around the atomic nucleus are freed they form an independent electron gas cloud co existing with the surrounding gas of atomic ions and neutral atoms in turn this generates an electric field where the motion of charges generates currents making a localised magnetic field and creates the state of matter called plasma the saha equation describes the degree of ionization for any gas in thermal equilibrium as a function of the temperature density and ionization energies of the atoms the saha equation only holds for weakly ionized plasmas for which the debye length is large this means that the screening of the coulomb interaction of ions and electrons by other ions and electrons is negligible the

the vector bosons regarded as elementary particles in the standard model are the gauge bosons the force carriers of fundamental interactions the photon of electromagnetism the w and z bosons of the weak interaction and the gluons of the strong interaction some composite particles are vector bosons for instance any vector meson quark and antiquark during the 1970s and 1980s intermediate vector bosons vector bosons of intermediate mass a mass between the two of the vector mesons drew much attention in particle physics the z and w particles interact with the higgs boson as shown in the feynman diagram the name vector boson arises from quantum field theory the component of such a particle s spin along any axis has the three eigenvalues 0 and where is the reduced planck constant meaning that any measurement of its spin can only yield one of these values this is at least true for massive vector bosons the situation is a bit different for massless particles such as the photon for reasons beyond the scope of this article see wigner s classification the space of spin states therefore is a discrete degree of freedom consisting of three states the same as the number

they formalise the various situations in geometry and algebra in which inverse images or pull backs of objects such as vector bundles can be defined as an example for each topological space there is the category of vector bundles on the space and for every continuous map from a topological space x to another topological space y is associated the pullback functor taking bundles on y to bundles on x fibred categories formalise the system consisting of these categories and inverse image functors similar setups appear in various guises in mathematics in particular in algebraic geometry which is the context in which fibred categories originally appeared fibered categories are used to define stacks which are fibered categories over a site with descent fibrations also play an important role in categorical semantics of type theory and in particular that of dependent type theories fibred categories were introduced by and developed in more detail by there are many examples in topology and geometry where some types of objects are considered to exist on or above or over some underlying base space the classical examples include vector bundles principal bundles and sheaves over topological spaces another example is given by families of algebraic

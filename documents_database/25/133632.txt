it originally referred to a fictitious instruction in ibm system 360 computers making a joke about its numerous non obvious instruction mnemonics with the advent of the mc6800 a design flaw was discovered by the programmers due to incomplete opcode decoding two illegal opcodes 0x9d and 0xdd will cause the program counter on the processor to increment endlessly which renders the processor useless those codes have been unofficially named hcf during the design process of mc6802 engineers originally planned to remove this instruction but kept it as is for testing purposes as a result hcf was officially recognized as a real instruction later hcf became a humorous catch all term for instructions that may freeze a processor including intentional instructions for testing purposes and unintentional illegal instructions some are considered hardware defects and if the system is shared a malicious user can execute it to launch a denial of service attack in the case of real instructions the implication of this expression is that whereas in most cases in which a cpu executes an unintended instruction a bug in the code the computer may still be able to recover in the case of an hcf instruction there is by definition

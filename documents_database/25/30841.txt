alternatively as a term of art it refers to the way such vessels are rigged as discussed below the combinations shown in a sail plan almost always include three configurations in all sail plans the architect attempts to balance the force of the sails against the drag of the underwater keel in such a way that the vessel naturally points into the wind in this way if control is lost the vessel will avoid broaching turning edge to the wind and being beaten by breaking waves broaching always causes uncomfortable motion and in a storm the breaking waves can destroy a lightly built boat the architect also tries to balance the wind force on each sail plan against a range of loads and ballast the calculation assures that the sail will not knock the vessel sideways with its mast in the water capsizing and perhaps sinking it each form of rig requires its own type of sails among them are the standard terminology assumes three masts from front to back the foremast mainmast and mizzenmast on ships with fewer than three masts the tallest is the mainmast ships with more masts number them from bottom to top the sails of

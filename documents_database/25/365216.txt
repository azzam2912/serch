the text is published in acta apostolicae sedis 1974 pages 89 92 the instruction secreta continere lists ten classes of matters covered by the pontifical secret while violation of pontifical secrecy if deliberate is a grave sin and while an automatic excommunication may sometimes be imposed for violation of secrecy on particular matters the general rule is only that if the violation becomes known outside of confession a penalty proportionate to the wrongdoing and the damage caused is to be inflicted an example of the imposition of automatic excommunication for violation of secrecy was found in the 1962 instruction crimen sollicitationis in force until replaced by new norms in 2001 which imposed this penalty on members of a church tribunal trying a priest accused of making sexual advances to a penitent in connection with the sacrament of penance if they violated secrecy about developments in the course of the ecclesiastical trial a person to whom such advances were made was on the contrary subjected to excommunication if that person failed to denounce the priest within at most one month thus the procedures of the church tribunal were covered by papal secrecy called at that time secrecy of the holy office

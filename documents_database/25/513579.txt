a ragdoll usually consists of a series of connected rigid bodies that are programmed to have newtonian physics acting upon them therefore very realistic effects can be generated that would very hardly be possible with traditional animation for example a character can die slumped over a cliff and the weight of its upper body can drag the rest of it over the edge even more complex examples of procedural animation can be found in the game spore wherein user created creatures will automatically be animated to all actions needed in the game from walking to driving to picking things up in the game unreal tournament 3 bodies who have gone into ragdoll mode to fake death can arise from any position into which they have fallen and get back on their feet the canceled indiana jones game from lucasarts shown at e3 2006 featured character motions that were animated entirely in real time with characters dodging punching and reacting to the environment based on an engine called euphoria by naturalmotion which has since been used in games such as grand theft auto iv and backbreaker

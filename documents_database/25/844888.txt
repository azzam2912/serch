he surfaced after the war with a massive amount of test results determined in samples selected from heterogeneous sampling units of coal in fact he had gathered so much valuable information that he was encouraged to write a phd thesis on the sampling of coal jan visman defended his phd thesis titled de monsterneming van heterogene binomiale korrelmengsels in het bijzonder steenkool at the technical university of delft on december 17 1947 visman proved that the variance of the primary sample selection stage the sampling variance is the sum of the composition variance and the distribution variance the composition variance is a measure for variability between particles within primary increments the distribution variance in contrast is a measure for variability between primary increments in a sampling unit and thus for its degree of heterogeneity he described a simple experiment to estimate the composition and distribution components of the sampling variance the distribution heterogeneity causes spatial dependence between measured values in ordered sets determined in sampling units and sample spaces visman worked briefly in ottawa after immigrating to canada in 1951 until his retirement in 1976 he headed the western regional laboratories of the department of mines and technical surveys which

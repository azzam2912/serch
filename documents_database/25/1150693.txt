at least two major isoforms due to alternative splicing are known in addition a polymorphism on valine 250 is known and may influence aminoglydoside induced deafness the gtpbp3 gene contains 10 exons and encodes a 44 kda gtp binding protein that is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to mammals the n terminal domain of mitochondrial trna modification gtpase mediates the dimerization of the protein in a potassium independent manner which is thought to be related to the construction of the binding site for the one carbon unit donor in its trna modification reaction function mitochondrial trna modification gtpase is thought to catalyze the formation of 5 taurinomethyluridine m 5 u in the anticodon wobble position of five mitochondrial trna the gene was first discovered yeast where the mutation of the yeast homolog of human gtpbp3 mss1 is found to elicit respiratory defect in yeast only when the mitochondrial 155 rrna p r 454 is present the latter is equivalent to the human 12 rrna a1555g mutation which has been found to associate with deafness hence gtpbp3 and its yeast homolog function in modification of mitochondrial function in human gtpbp3 is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues in multiple transcripts as a trna

some of these receptors are involved in pathological conditions for example a point mutation in fgfr3 can lead to achondroplasia the fibroblast growth factor receptors consist of an extracellular ligand domain composed of three immunoglobulin like domains a single transmembrane helix domain and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity these receptors bind fibroblast growth factors members of the largest family of growth factor ligands comprising 22 members the natural alternate splicing of four fibroblast growth factor receptor fgfr genes results in the production of over 48 different isoforms of fgfr these isoforms vary in their ligand binding properties and kinase domains however all share the common extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin ig like domains d1 d3 and thus belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily the three immunoglobin ig like domains d1 d2 and d3 present a stretch of acidic amino acids the acid box between d1 and d2 this acid box can participate in the regulation of fgf binding to the fgfr immunoglobulin like domains d2 and d3 are sufficient for fgf binding each receptor can be activated by several fgfs in many cases the fgfs themselves can also activate more than one receptor i e fgf1 which binds

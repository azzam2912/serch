characteristically linear induction motors have a finite primary or secondary length which generates end effects whereas a conventional induction motor is arranged in an endless loop despite their name not all linear induction motors produce linear motion some linear induction motors are employed for generating rotations of large diameters where the use of a continuous primary would be very expensive as with rotary motors linear motors frequently run on a three phase power supply and can support very high speeds however there are end effects that reduce the motor s force and it is often not possible to fit a gearbox to trade off force and speed linear induction motors are thus frequently less energy efficient than normal rotary motors for any given required force output lims unlike their rotary counterparts can give a levitation effect they are therefore often used where contactless force is required where low maintenance is desirable or where the duty cycle is low their practical uses include magnetic levitation linear propulsion and linear actuators they have also been used for pumping liquid metals the history of linear electric motors can be traced back at least as far as the 1840s to the work of charles

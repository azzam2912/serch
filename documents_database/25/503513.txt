in the two factor case it states a capital abundant country will export the capital intensive good while the labor abundant country will export the labor intensive good the critical assumption of the heckscher ohlin model is that the two countries are identical except for the difference in resource endowments this also implies that the aggregate preferences are the same the relative abundance in capital will cause the capital abundant country to produce the capital intensive good cheaper than the labor abundant country and vice versa initially when the countries are not trading once trade is allowed profit seeking firms will move their products to the markets that have temporary higher price as a result the leontief paradox presented by wassily leontief in 1951 found that the u s the most capital abundant country in the world by any criterion exported labor intensive commodities and imported capital intensive commodities in apparent contradiction with the heckscher ohlin theorem however if labor is separated into two distinct factors skilled labor and unskilled labor the heckscher ohlin theorem is more accurate the u s tends to export skilled labor intensive goods and tends to import unskilled labor intensive goods

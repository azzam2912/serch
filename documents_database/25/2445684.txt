to speed up the design process pre existing molds were used for the aircraft s construction the fuselage mold of the akaflieg stuttgart fs31 was reused along with molds for the fin of a schempp hirth nimbus 3d and tailplane of a nimbus 4d the wing molds of the akaflieg stuttgart fs32 were modified with the replacement of the slotted flaps with plain flaps and an extension of the wingspan part of the control rods in the cockpit were taken over from the schleicher ash 25 the aircraft was first displayed publicly during the aero 1997 in friedrichshafen the fs33 is a two seater mid wing glider it is almost entirely made out of carbon fiber composites with the cockpit region being made out of a carbon kevlar hybrid the fuselage is split horizontally as with the fs31 instead of vertically to improve pilot safety during a crash landing by eliminating a seam on the underside of the cockpit the aircraft has a wingspan of 20 meters and its wings are equipped with full span flaps and winglets the flaps also serve as ailerons with their operation being controlled by a mixer located at the wing root originally the fs33

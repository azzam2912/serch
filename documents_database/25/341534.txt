it is a colorless hygroscopic and flammable tertiary amine it is a gas at room temperature but is usually sold in pressurized gas cylinders or as a 40 solution in water tma is a nitrogenous base and can be readily protonated to give trimethylammonium cation trimethylammonium chloride is a hygroscopic colorless solid prepared from hydrochloric acid trimethylamine is a good nucleophile and this reaction is the basis of most of its applications tma is widely used in industry it is used in the synthesis of choline tetramethylammonium hydroxide plant growth regulators or herbicides strongly basic anion exchange resins dye leveling agents and a number of basic dyes at higher concentrations it has an ammonia like odor and can cause necrosis of mucous membranes on contact at lower concentrations it has a fishy odor the odor associated with rotting fish in humans ingestion of certain plant and animal e g red meat egg yolk food containing lecithin choline and l carnitine provides certain gut microbiota with the substrate to synthesize tma which is then absorbed into the bloodstream high levels of trimethylamine in the body are associated with the development of trimethylaminuria or fish odor syndrome caused by a genetic defect

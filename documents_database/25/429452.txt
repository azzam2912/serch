this field holds the promise of engineering damaged tissues and organs by stimulating the body s own repair mechanisms to functionally heal previously irreparable tissues or organs regenerative medicine also includes the possibility of growing tissues and organs in the laboratory and implanting them when the body cannot heal itself if a regenerated organ s cells would be derived from the patient s own tissue or cells this would potentially solve the problem of the shortage of organs available for donation and the problem of organ transplant rejection some of the biomedical approaches within the field of regenerative medicine may involve the use of stem cells examples include the injection of stem cells or progenitor cells obtained through directed differentiation cell therapies the induction of regeneration by biologically active molecules administered alone or as a secretion by infused cells immunomodulation therapy and transplantation of in vitro grown organs and tissues tissue engineering the term regenerative medicine was first used in a 1992 article on hospital administration by leland kaiser kaiser s paper closes with a series of short paragraphs on future technologies that will impact hospitals one paragraph had regenerative medicine as a bold print title and stated a new

the amendment was supported by the silvio berlusconi government voters were asked whether they approved of amending the constitution to give more powers to the regions on issues including agriculture education healthcare and taxation the proposals were approved by 64 2 of voters the resulting constitutional changes are subject of conflicting opinions regarding the practical success of the amendment in its most evident outcome the text of article 117 of the constitution was inverted whereas the original text listed the areas where the regions had legislative authority where the regions and the state had shared authority and leaving any other subject matter in the hands of the regions the new version of this article lists a series of subjects as areas of legislative authority of the state with others having shared authority and anything that isn t specifically mentioned being included in the legislative authority of the regions this solution typical of federated states was applied to italy a regional state with marginal effective results due to a series of contributing factors that in practice reduced the regions ability to legislative to almost the same level as in pre constitutional reform days

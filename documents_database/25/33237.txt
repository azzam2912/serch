chinese characters do not constitute an alphabet or a compact syllabary rather the writing system is roughly logosyllabic that is a character generally represents one syllable of spoken chinese and may be a word on its own or a part of a polysyllabic word the characters themselves are often composed of parts that may represent physical objects abstract notions or pronunciation literacy requires the memorization of a great number of characters educated chinese know about 4 000 the large number of chinese characters has in part led to the adoption of western alphabets as an auxiliary means of representing chinese various current chinese characters have been traced back to the late shang dynasty about 1200 1050 bc but the process of creating characters is thought to have begun some centuries earlier after a period of variation and evolution chinese characters were standardized under the qin dynasty 221 206 bc over the millennia these characters have evolved into well developed styles of chinese calligraphy as the varieties of chinese diverged a situation of diglossia developed with speakers of mutually unintelligible varieties able to communicate through writing using classical chinese in the early 20th century classical chinese was replaced in this role

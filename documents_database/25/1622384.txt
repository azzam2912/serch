the most conspicuous exceptions are the pycnogonida which probably are chelicerate relatives in entomology the labrum amounts to the upper lip of an insect mouth the corresponding lower lip being the labium the evolutionary origin embryogenesis and morphological development of the labrum have proved to be by far the most controversial and challenging topic in the study of arthropod head structures the labrum is innervated in crustaceans and insects from the tritocerebrum the back of the brain however in development its embryonic primordium often appears at the anterior of the head and migrates backwards towards its adult position furthermore it often appears as a bilobed structure with a set of muscles nerves and gene expression in many ways similar to that of an appendage this evidence has been used to suggest that the labrum is in fact a highly reduced appendage its tritocerebral from the rear of the brain has suggested to some workers that if an appendage it is the appendage of the segment anterior to the first antenna but this is disputed by others who argue that the presence of a well developed appendage in at least crustaceans in this segment the second antenna corresponding to the intercalary

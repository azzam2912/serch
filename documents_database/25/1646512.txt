this connection can be temporary or semipermanent such as for space station modules docking specifically refers to joining of two separate free flying space vehicles berthing refers to mating operations where an inactive module vehicle is placed into the mating interface of another space vehicle by using a robotic arm because the modern process of un berthing is laborious and time consuming berthing operations are unsuited for rapid crew evacuations in the event of an emergency a docking berthing connection is referred to as either soft or hard typically a spacecraft first initiates a soft dock by making contact and latching its docking connector with that of the target vehicle once the soft connection is secured if both spacecraft are pressurized they may proceed to a hard dock where the docking mechanisms form an airtight seal enabling interior hatches to be safely opened so that crew and cargo can be transferred spacecraft docking capability depends on space rendezvous the ability of two spacecraft to find each other and station keep in the same orbit this was first developed by the united states for project gemini it was planned for the crew of gemini 6 to rendezvous and manually dock under

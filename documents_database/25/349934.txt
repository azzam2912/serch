that is the problem is not turing reducible to post s theorem establishes a relationship between the turing jump operator and the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers informally given a problem the turing jump returns the set of turing machines which halt when given access to an oracle that solves that problem the turing jump of x can be thought of as an oracle to the halting problem for oracle machines with an oracle to x formally given a set and a g del numbering of the computable functions the turing jump of is defined as the th turing jump is defined inductively by the jump of is the effective join of the sequence of sets for where denotes the th prime the notation or is often used for the turing jump of the empty set it is read zero jump or sometimes zero prime similarly is the th jump of the empty set for finite these sets are closely related to the arithmetic hierarchy the jump can be iterated into transfinite ordinals the sets for where is the church kleene ordinal are closely related to the hyperarithmetic hierarchy beyond the process can be continued through the countable

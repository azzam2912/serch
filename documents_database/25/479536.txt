the distance to this star has been measured directly using the parallax technique which yields a value of roughly with a 4 margin of error the stellar classification of lambda ursae majoris is a2 iv with the luminosity class of iv indicating that after 410 million years on the main sequence this star is in the process of evolving into a giant star as the supply of hydrogen at its core becomes exhausted compared to the sun it has 240 of the mass and 230 of the sun s radius but is radiating 37 times as much luminosity this energy is being emitted from the star s outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 9 280 k giving it the characteristic white hot glow of an a type star ursae majoris latinised to lambda ursae majoris is the star s bayer designation it bore the traditional names tania shared with mu ursae majoris and tania borealis tania comes from the arabic phrase the second spring of the gazelle and borealis originally borealis is latin for the north side in 2016 the international astronomical union organized a working group on star names wgsn to catalog and standardize proper names for stars

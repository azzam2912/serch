it may lead to phenomena such as houses feeling cooler in the winter and warmer in the summer at the same temperature for example in a room in which air temperature is maintained at 22 celsius at all times but in which the inner surfaces of the house is estimated to be an average temperature of 10 celsius in the winter or 25 celsius in the summer heat transfer from the surfaces to the individual will occur resulting in a difference in the perceived temperature we can observe and compare the rate of radiation heat transfer between a person and the surrounding surfaces if we first make a few simplifying assumptions for an average person the outer surface area is 1 4 m the surface temperature is 30 celsius and the emissivity is 0 95 emissivity is the ability of a surface to emit radiant energy compared to that of a black body at the same temperature we will be using the following equation to find out how much heat is lost by a person standing in the same room in summertime as compared to the winter at exactly the same thermostat reading temperature q a s t s 4

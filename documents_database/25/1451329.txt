the process of drug manufacturing can be broken down into a series of unit operations such as milling granulation coating tablet pressing and others while a laboratory may use dry ice as a cooling agent for reaction selectivity this process gets complicated on an industrial scale the cost to cool a typical reactor to this temperature is large and the viscosity of the reagents typically also increases as the temperature lowers leading to difficult mixing this results in added costs to stir harder and replace parts more often or it results in a non homogeneous reaction finally lower temperatures can result in crusting of reagents intermediates and byproducts to the reaction vessel over time which will impact the purity of the product different stoichiometric ratios of reagents can result in different ratios of products formed on the industrial scale adding a large amount of reagent a to reagent b may take time during this the reagent a that is added is exposed to a much higher stoichiometric amount of reagent b until it is all added and this imbalance can lead to reagent a prematurely reacting and subsequent products to also react with the huge excess of reagent b whether

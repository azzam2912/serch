tracking algorithms provide the ability to predict future position of multiple moving objects based on the history of the individual positions being reported by sensor systems historical information is accumulated and used to predict future position for use with air traffic control threat estimation combat system doctrine gun aiming missile guidance and torpedo delivery position data is accumulated over the span of a few minutes to a few weeks there are four common track algorithms the original tracking algorithms were built into custom hardware that became common during world war ii this includes storage tubes used with planned position indicator displays range height indicator displays and pen plotting boards used for civilian air traffic control and waterway management it also includes custom analog computers like the mark i fire control computer used with radar data to aim guns missiles and torpedoes associated with military air traffic control and waterway management track algorithms were migrated from analog equipment to digital computers from the 1950s through the 1980s this was necessary to eliminate limitations that include mid air collisions and other problems linked with obsolete equipment that was socialized by patco and united states department of defense similar migration trends occurred in

composed of three cardinal plane components subtalar eversion ankle dorsiflexion and forefoot abduction these three distinct motions of the foot occur simultaneously during the pronation phase pronation is a normal desirable and necessary component of the gait cycle pronation is the first half of the stance phase whereas supination starts the propulsive phase as the heel begins to lift off the ground the normal biomechanics of the foot absorb and direct the occurring throughout the gait whereas the foot is flexible pronation and rigid supination during different phases of the gait cycle as the foot is loaded eversion of the subtalar joint dorsiflexion of the ankle and abduction of the forefoot occur pronation should not occur past the latter stages of midstance as the normal foot should then supinate in preparation for toe off abnormal pronation occurs when a foot pronates when it should supinate or overpronates during a normal pronation period of the gait cycle approximately four degrees of pronation and supination are necessary to enable the foot to propel forward properly in the neutral position the foot is neither pronating nor supinating if the foot is pronating or supinating during the stance phase of the gait cycle when

the line element of a stationary spacetime has the form formula 2 where formula 4 is the time coordinate formula 5 are the three spatial coordinates and formula 6 is the metric tensor of 3 dimensional space in this coordinate system the killing vector field formula 7 has the components formula 8 formula 9 is a positive scalar representing the norm of the killing vector i e formula 10 and formula 11 is a 3 vector called the twist vector which vanishes when the killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal the latter arises as the spatial components of the twist 4 vector formula 12 see for example p 163 which is orthogonal to the killing vector formula 7 i e satisfies formula 14 the twist vector measures the extent to which the killing vector fails to be orthogonal to a family of 3 surfaces a non zero twist indicates the presence of rotation in the spacetime geometry the coordinate representation described above has an interesting geometrical interpretation the time translation killing vector generates a one parameter group of motion formula 15 in the spacetime formula 16 by identifying the spacetime points that lie on a particular trajectory also called orbit one

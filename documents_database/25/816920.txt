however some critical theorists suggest that meaning is only divided into smaller structural units via its regulation in concrete social interactions outside of these interactions language may become meaningless structural semantics is that branch that marked the modern linguistics movement started by ferdinand de saussure at the break of the 20th century in his posthumous discourse titled cours de linguistique generale a course in general linguistics he posits that language is a system of inter related units and structures and that every unit of language is related to the others within the same system his position later became the bedding ground for other theories such as componential analysis and relational predicates structuralism is a very efficient aspect of semantics as it explains the concordance in the meaning of certain words and utterances the concept of sense relations as a means of semantic interpretation is an offshoot of this theory as well structuralism has revolutionized semantics to its present state and it also aids to the correct understanding of other aspects of linguistics the consequential fields of structuralism in linguistics are sense relations both lexical and sentential among others

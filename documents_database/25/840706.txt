this follows from the birkhoff von neumann theorem which states that the extreme points of the birkhoff polytope are the permutation matrices and therefore that any doubly stochastic matrix may be represented as a convex combination of permutation matrices this was stated in a 1946 paper by garrett birkhoff but equivalent results in the languages of projective configurations and of regular bipartite graph matchings respectively were shown much earlier in 1894 in ernst steinitz s thesis and in 1916 by d nes k nig the edges of the birkhoff polytope correspond to pairs of permutations differing by a cycle this implies that the graph of b is a cayley graph of the symmetric group s this also implies that the graph of b is a complete graph k and thus b is a neighborly polytope the birkhoff polytope lies within an dimensional affine subspace of the n dimensional space of all matrices this subspace is determined by the linear equality constraints that the sum of each row and of each column be one within this subspace it is defined by n linear inequalities one for each coordinate of the matrix specifying that the coordinate be non negative therefore for formula

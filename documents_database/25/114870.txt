this meaning is different from remote control vehicles operating on land or in the air rovs are unoccupied usually highly maneuverable and operated by a crew either aboard a vessel floating platform or on proximate land they are common in deepwater industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction they are linked to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether or often when working in rough conditions or in deeper water a load carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system tms the tms is either a garage like device which contains the rov during lowering through the splash zone or on larger work class rovs a separate assembly which sits on top of the rov the purpose of the tms is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized the umbilical cable is an armored cable that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power video and data signals between the operator and the tms where used the tms then relays the signals and power for the rov down the tether cable once at the rov the electric power is distributed

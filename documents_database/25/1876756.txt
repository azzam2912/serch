it has been shown that the shortest path between a solved cube and the superflip position requires 20 moves under the usual half turn metric htm in which rotating a face 180 counts as a single move and that no position requires more although there are many other positions that also require 20 moves under the more restrictive quarter turn metric qtm only 90 face turns are allowed so 180 turns count as two moves in those terms the superflip requires 24 moves and is not maximally distant from the solved state instead when superflip is composed with the four dot or four spot position in which four faces have their centers exchanged with the centers on the opposite face the resulting position may be unique in requiring 26 moves under qtm this is one possible sequence of moves to generate the superflip starting from a solved rubik s cube recorded in singmaster notation it is the minimal 20 moves in the half turn metric though it requires 28 quarter turns u r2 f b r b2 r u2 l b2 r u d r2 f r l b2 u2 f2 one of solutions in 24 quarter turns but 22

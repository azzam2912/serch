the trpc3 6 7 subfamily are implicated in the regulation of vascular tone cell growth proliferation and pathological hypertrophy these are diacylgylcerol sensitive cation channels known regulate intracellular calcium via activation of the phospholipase c plc pathway and or by sensing ca2 store depletion together their role in calcium homeostasis has made them potential therapeutic targets for a variety of central and peripheral pathologies non specific cation conductance elicited by the activation of trkb by bdnf is trpc3 dependent in the cns trpc channels are almost always co localized with mglur1 expressing cells and likely play a role in mglur mediated epsps the trpc3 channel has been shown to be preferentially expressed in non excitable cell types such as oligodendrocytes however evidence suggests that active trpc3 channels in basal ganglia bg output neurons are responsible for maintaining a tonic inward depolarizing current that regulates resting membrane potential and promotes regular neuronal firing conversely inhibiting trpc3 promotes cellular hyperpolarization which can lead to slower and more irregular neuronal firing while it s unclear if trpc3 channels have equal expression other members of the trpc family have been localized to the axon hillock cell body and dendritic processes of dopamine expressing cells

the intention in ballistic exercises is to maximise the acceleration phase of an object s movement and minimise the deceleration phase for instance throwing a medicine ball maximises the acceleration of the ball this can be contrasted with a standard weight training exercise where there would be a pronounced deceleration phase at the end of the repetition i e at the end of a bench press exercise the barbell is decelerated and brought to a halt similarly an athlete jumping whilst holding a trap bar maximises the acceleration of the weight through the process of holding it whilst they jump where as they would decelerate it at the end of a standard trap bar deadlift ballistic training was first used among elite athletes who were looking for a method to develop explosiveness the word ballistic comes from the greek word ballein which means to throw in this type of training the athlete accelerates and releases the weight into free space common ballistic training exercises are bench throws jump squats cleans snatches and push presses ballistic training forces the athlete s body to recruit and trigger fast twitch muscle fibers this is important because these muscle fibers have the greatest potential

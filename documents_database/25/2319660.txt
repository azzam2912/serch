compared to conventional microscopes which usually require sectioning to exclude blurred signals from outside of the focal plane muse s low penetration depth limits the excitation volume to a thin layer and removes the tissue sectioning requirement the entire signal collected is the desired light and all photons collected contribute to the image formation the microscope setup is based on an inverted microscope design an automated stage is used to record larger areas by mosaicing a series of single adjacent frames the led s light is focused using a ball lens with a short focal length onto the sample surface in an oblique angle cis illumination scheme since standard microscopy optics do not transmit uv light efficiently no dichroic mirror or filter is required as microscope objectives are opaque to uv excitation light the emitted fluorescence light was collected using a long working distance objective and focused via a tube lens onto a ccd camera specimens are submerged in exogenous dye for 10 seconds and then briefly washed in water or phosphated buffered saline pbs the resulting stained specimens generated bright enough signals for direct and interpretable visualization through microscope eyepiece previous work from muse includes the detection of endogenous

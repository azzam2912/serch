we may for example also set coulomb s constant k and the electric charge formula 3 to unity the reduced planck constant is not equal to 1 in this system stoney units in contrast to planck units this system is useful in physics especially in the special and general theories of relativity all physical quantities are identified with geometric quantities such as areas lengths dimensionless numbers path curvatures or sectional curvatures many equations in relativistic physics appear simpler when expressed in geometric units because all occurrences of g and of c drop out for example the schwarzschild radius of a nonrotating uncharged black hole with mass m becomes for this reason many books and papers on relativistic physics use geometric units an alternative system of geometrized units is often used in particle physics and cosmology in which instead this introduces an additional factor of 8 into newton s law of universal gravitation but simplifies einstein s equations the einstein hilbert action the friedmann equations and the newtonian poisson equation by removing the corresponding factor practical measurements and computations are usually done in si units but conversions are generally quite straightforward in geometric units every time interval is interpreted as the

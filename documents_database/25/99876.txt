effects of surface based anticyclones include clearing skies as well as cooler drier air fog can also form overnight within a region of higher pressure mid tropospheric systems such as the subtropical ridge deflect tropical cyclones around their periphery and cause a temperature inversion inhibiting free convection near their center building up surface based haze under their base anticyclones aloft can form within warm core lows such as tropical cyclones due to descending cool air from the backside of upper troughs such as polar highs or from large scale sinking such as the subtropical ridge the evolution of an anticyclone depends upon variables such as its size intensity and extent of moist convection as well as the coriolis force sir francis galton first discovered anticyclones in the 1860s preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the hydrosphere are beneath the western side of troughs or dips in the rossby wave pattern high pressure systems are alternatively referred to as anticyclones their circulation is sometimes referred to as cum sole subtropical high pressure zones form under the descending portion of the hadley cell circulation upper level high pressure areas lie over tropical cyclones due to their warm

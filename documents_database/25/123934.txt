they are thought to be vestiges of primitive red and green algal nuclei that were engulfed by a larger eukaryote because the nucleomorph lies between two sets of membranes nucleomorphs support the endosymbiotic theory and are evidence that the plastids containing them are complex plastids having two sets of membranes indicate that the plastid a prokaryote was engulfed by a eukaryote an alga which was then engulfed by another eukaryote the host cell making the plastid an example of secondary endosymbiosis so far only two monophyletic groups of organisms are known to contain plastids with a vestigal nucleus or nucleomorph the cryptomonads of the supergroup chromista and the chlorarachniophytes of the supergroup rhizaria both of which have examples of sequenced nucleomorph genomes studies of the genomic organization and of the molecular phylogeny have shown that the nucleomorph of the cryptomonads used to be the nucleus of a red alga whereas the nucleomorph of the chlorarchniophytes was the nucleus of a green alga in both groups of organisms the plastids originate from engulfed photoautotrophic eukaryotes of the two known plastids that contain nucleomorphs both have four membranes the nucleomorph residing in the periplastidial compartment evidence of being engulfed by a eukaryote

its value using the modern definition of prime is approximately the constant is irrational this can be proven with dirichlet s theorem on arithmetic progressions or bertrand s postulate hardy and wright p 113 or ramare s theorem that every even integer is a sum of at most six primes it also follows directly from its normality see below by a similar argument any constant created by concatenating 0 with all primes in an arithmetic progression dn a where a is coprime to d and to 10 will be irrational e g primes of the form 4 n 1 or 8 n 1 by dirichlet s theorem the arithmetic progression dn 10 a contains primes for all m and those primes are also in cd a so the concatenated primes contain arbitrarily long sequences of the digit zero in base 10 the constant is a normal number a fact proven by arthur herbert copeland and paul erd s in 1946 hence the name of the constant the constant is given by where p is the n th prime number its continued fraction is 0 4 4 8 16 18 5 1 copeland and erd s s proof that their constant

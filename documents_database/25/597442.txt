generifs provide a simple mechanism for allowing scientists to add to the functional annotation of genes described in the entrez gene database in practice function is construed quite broadly for example there are generifs that discuss the role of a gene in a disease generifs that point the viewer towards a review article about the gene and generifs that discuss the structure of a gene however the stated intent is for generifs to be about gene function currently over half a million generifs have been created for genes from almost 1000 different species generifs are always associated with specific entries in the entrez gene database each generif has a pointer to the pubmed id a type of document identifier of a scientific publication that provides evidence for the statement made by the generif generifs are often extracted directly from the document that is identified by the pubmed id very frequently from its title or from its final sentence generifs are usually produced by ncbi indexers but anyone may submit a generif to be processed a valid gene id must exist for the specific gene or the gene staff must have assigned an overall gene id to the species the latter

the withdrawal of such trophic support leads to a form of cellular suicide various dependence receptors are involved in a range of biological events developmental cell death naturally occurring cell death trophic factor withdrawal induced cell death the spontaneous regression characteristic of type iv s neuroblastoma neurodegenerative cell death inhibition of new tumor cells tumorigenesis and metastasis and therapeutic antibody mediated tumor cell death as well as programmed cell death in other instances since these receptors may support either cell death or cell survival they initiate a new type of tumor suppressor a conditional tumor suppressor in addition events such as cellular atrophy and process retraction may also be mediated by dependence receptors although this has not been as well documented as the induction of programmed cell death the following is the list of known dependence receptors cells depend for their survival on stimulation that is mediated by various receptors and sensors for any required stimulus its withdrawal leads to a form of cellular suicide that is the cell plays an active role in its own demise the term programmed cell death was first suggested by lockshin williams in 1964 apoptosis a form of programmed cell death was first described

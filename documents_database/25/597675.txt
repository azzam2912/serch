it is flat and triangular in form narrower in the middle than at the ends it runs from the sacrum the lower transverse sacral tubercles the inferior margins sacrum and the upper coccyx to the tuberosity of the ischium it is a remnant of part of biceps femoris muscle the sacrotuberous ligament is attached by its broad base to the posterior superior iliac spine the posterior sacroiliac ligaments with which it is partly blended to the lower transverse sacral tubercles and the lateral margins of the lower sacrum and upper coccyx its oblique fibres descend laterally converging to form a thick narrow band that widens again below and is attached to the medial margin of the ischial tuberosity it then spreads along the ischial ramus as the falciform process whose concave edge blends with the fascial sheath of the internal pudendal vessels and pudendal nerve the lowest fibres of gluteus maximus are attached to the posterior surface of the ligament superficial fibres of the lower part of the ligament continue into the tendon of biceps femoris the ligament is pierced by the coccygeal branches of the inferior gluteal artery the perforating cutaneous nerve and filaments of the coccygeal plexus the

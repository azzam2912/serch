most commonly a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time thus it is a sequence of discrete time data examples of time series are heights of ocean tides counts of sunspots and the daily closing value of the dow jones industrial average time series are very frequently plotted via line charts time series are used in statistics signal processing pattern recognition econometrics mathematical finance weather forecasting earthquake prediction electroencephalography control engineering astronomy communications engineering and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values while regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series this type of analysis of time series is not called time series analysis which focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time

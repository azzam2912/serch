newton s law states that any two bodies attract one another with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them when used geographically the words bodies and masses are replaced by locations and importance respectively where importance can be measured in terms of population numbers gross domestic product or other appropriate variables the gravity model of migration is therefore based upon the idea that as the importance of one or both of the location increases there will also be an increase in movement between them the farther apart the two locations are however the movement between them will be less this phenomenon is known as distance decay the gravity model can be used to estimate the gravity model can also be used to determine the sphere of influence of each central place by estimating where the breaking point between the two settlements will be an example of this is the point at which customers find it preferable because of distance time and expense considerations to travel to one center rather than the other the gravity model can be used to measure accessibility to services e x

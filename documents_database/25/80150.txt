it was first described in a spoof scientific paper titled the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline in 1948 the major peculiarity of the chemical is its endochronicity it starts dissolving before it makes contact with water asimov went on to write three additional short stories each describing different properties or uses of thiotimoline in asimov s writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule there is at least one carbon atom such that while two of the carbon s four chemical bonds lie in normal space and time one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past thiotimoline is derived from the bark of the fictitious shrub rosacea karlsbadensis rugo and the thiotimoline molecule includes at least fourteen hydroxy groups two amino groups and one sulfonic acid group and possibly one nitro compound group as well the nature of the hydrocarbon nucleus is unknown although it seems in part to be an aromatic hydrocarbon in 1947 asimov was engaged in doctoral research in chemistry and as part of his experimental procedure he needed to dissolve catechol in water as he observed the crystals dissolve as soon as they hit

her dissertation on approximation algorithms was supervised by seffi naor she has been at the toyota technological institute since 2007 and also holds a position in the computer science department of the university of chicago chuzhoy won the best paper award at the 2012 symposium on foundations of computer science for her paper with shi li on approximating the problem of connecting many given pairs of vertices in a graph by edge disjoint paths she is also known for her work showing a polynomial relation between the size of a grid graph minor of a graph and its treewidth this connection between these two graph properties is a key component of the robertson seymour theorem is closely related to halin s grid theorem for infinite graphs and underlies the theory of bidimensionality for graph approximation algorithms she was an invited speaker at the 2014 international congress of mathematicians in seoul

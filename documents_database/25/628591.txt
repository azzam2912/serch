the small unit is flown by helicopter to a maritime insertion point once there the aircraft assumes an altitude just above the water s surface and an airspeed of or less team members then exit the aircraft and enter the water in some cases depending upon the mission parameters and the aircraft used personnel may be inserted along with an inflatable boat for over the horizon operations when a fully inflated boat is transported and inserted with personnel this type of operation is known as a hard duck in cases where a fully inflated boat cannot be accommodated by the aircraft it can be partially deflated for transit and inflated at the insertion point by means of a foot pump this type of operation is known as a soft duck if inflation to any degree is not feasible a rolled duck may be performed once team members are in the water they may swim to the objective or in the case of a hard duck soft duck or rolled duck conduct an over the horizon transit to the objective via inflatable boat

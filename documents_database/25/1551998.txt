in principle most collocation problems can be solved by a nearest neighbor search but in practice there are many other considerations involved and the best method is highly specific to the particular matching of instruments here we deal with some of the most important considerations along with specific examples there are at least two main considerations when performing collocations the first is the sampling pattern of the instrument measurements may be dense and regular such as those from a cross track scanning satellite instrument in this case some form of interpolation may be appropriate on the other hand the measurements may be sparse such as a one off field campaign designed for some particular validation exercise the second consideration is the instrument footprint which can range from something approaching a point measurement such as that of a radiosonde or it might be several kilometers in diameter such as that of a satellite mounted microwave radiometer in the latter case it is appropriate to take into account the instrument antenna pattern when making comparisons with another instrument having both a smaller footprint and a denser sampling that is several measurements from the one instrument will fit into the footprint of the

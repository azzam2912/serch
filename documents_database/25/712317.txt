the surface area that is of importance is that part that is involved in substrate uptake biofilms on a flat solid substrate are examples of v0 morphs they grow in thickness but not in surface area that is involved in nutrient exchange other examples are dinophyta and diatoms that have a cell wall that does not change during the cell cycle during cell growth when the amounts of protein and carbohydrates increase the vacuole shrinks the outer membrane that is involved in nutrient uptake remains constant at cell division the daughter cells rapidly take up water complete a new cell wall and the cycle repeats rods bacteria that have the shape of a rod and grow in length but not in diameter are a static mixture between a v0 and a v1 morph where the caps act as v0 morphs and the cylinder between the caps as v1 morph the mixture is called static because the weight coefficients of the contributions of the v0 and v1 morph terms in the shape correction function are constant during growth crusts such as lichens that grow on a solid substrate are a dynamic mixture between a v0 and a v1 morph where the

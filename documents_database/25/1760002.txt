it provides an easy way to write programs that compile and execute on data parallel hardware such as graphics cards gpus c amp is a library implemented on directx 11 and an open specification from microsoft for implementing data parallelism directly in c it is intended to make programming gpus easy for the developer by supporting a range of expertise from none in which case the system does its best to being more finely controllable but still portable in microsoft s implementation code that cannot be run on gpus will fall back onto one or more cpus instead and use sse instructions the microsoft implementation is included in visual studio 2012 including debugger and profiler support the initial c amp release from microsoft requires at least windows 7 or windows server 2008 r2 as c amp is an open specification it is expected that in time implementations outside microsoft will appear one early example of this is shevlin park intel s experimental implementation of c amp on clang llvm and opencl on november 12 2013 the hsa foundation announced a c amp compiler that outputs to opencl standard portable intermediate representation spir and hsa intermediate language hsail supporting the current

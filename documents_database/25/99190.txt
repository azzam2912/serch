these behaviors could include an extension of the program by adding new code by extending objects and definitions or by modifying the type system although similar behaviors can be emulated in nearly any language with varying degrees of difficulty complexity and performance costs dynamic languages provide direct tools to make use of them many of these features were first implemented as native features in the lisp programming language most dynamic languages are also dynamically typed but not all are dynamic languages are frequently but not always referred to as scripting languages although the term scripting language in its narrowest sense refers to languages specific to a given run time environment some dynamic languages offer an eval function this function takes a string parameter containing code in the language and executes it if this code stands for an expression the resulting value is returned however erik meijer and peter drayton suggests that programmers use eval as a poor man s substitute for higher order functions a type or object system can typically be modified during runtime in a dynamic language this can mean generating new objects from a runtime definition or based on mixins of existing types or objects this can

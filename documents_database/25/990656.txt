it commenced operation in 2005 and has a capacity of 42 mw and consists of 21 gearless e 70 e4 2 mw enercon wind turbines it is clearly visible from the r742 regional road some of the wind turbines are within a couple of hundred metres of it the produced energy in one year is 110 gwh this equals the yearly consumption of 125 000 people or 31 500 four person households within 3 7 months of operation the wind energy converters wec at this site had produced an amount of energy equivalent to that used building and installing the wec including production of the materials for the next 20 years the wind farm will be producing electricity without using any resources and without pollution the e 70 turbines have rotor diameters of 71 m so the swept area is 3 959 m the nacelle in the hub height of 64 m is assessable through a ladder within the tower which is 4 2 m in diameter at the base and 2 9 m at top the nacelle itself has a diameter of 5m the height of a two storey building the turbine rotor spins with a speed between 6

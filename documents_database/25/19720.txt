together a prime meridian and its anti meridian the 180th meridian in a 360 system form a great circle this great circle divides a spheroid e g earth into two hemispheres if one uses directions of east and west from a defined prime meridian then they can be called the eastern hemisphere and the western hemisphere a prime meridian is ultimately arbitrary unlike an equator which is determined by the axis of rotation and various conventions have been used or advocated in different regions and throughout history the most widely used modern meridian is the iers reference meridian it is derived but deviates slightly from the greenwich meridian which was selected as an international standard in 1884 longitudes for the earth and moon are measured from their prime meridian at 0 to 180 east and to 180 west for all other solar system bodies longitude is measured from 0 their prime meridian to 360 west longitudes are used if the rotation of the body is direct that is it follows the right hand rule east longitudes are used if the rotation is retrograde the notion of longitude was developed by the greek eratosthenes c 276 bc c 195 bc in

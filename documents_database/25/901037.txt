taler les mar es was a manoeuver in use during the age of sail in seas with a strong tide such as those off the coasts of western europe particularly the channel the force of the tide on a ship could equal or surpass the power derived from sails so for a ship moving along the channel in light breezes a favourable tide could double its speed contrariwise when the tide changed the ship could be slowed to a halt or even be swept backwards to cope with this ships would anchor stopping the tide to preserve their progress the technique played an important role in the naval conflicts of the period in actions which lasted a long time or at least beyond a change of tide and which took place in light winds or calm conditions stopping the tide could be critical at the battle of barfleur for example when shovell s squadron was caught by the flood and dropped anchor the sandwich whose captain had failed to prepare for this was swept by the tide towards and through the french line of battle who had also anchored she was exposed to their concentrated fire and suffered extensive damage

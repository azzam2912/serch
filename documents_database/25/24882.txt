the goal of the attack is to gain information that reduces the security of the encryption scheme modern ciphers aim to provide semantic security also known as ciphertext indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack and are therefore by design generally immune to chosen plaintext attacks if correctly implemented in a chosen plaintext attack the adversary can possibly adaptively ask for the ciphertexts of arbitrary plaintext messages this is formalized by allowing the adversary to interact with an encryption oracle viewed as a black box the attacker s goal is to reveal all or part of the secret encryption key it may seem infeasible in practice that an attacker could obtain ciphertexts for given plaintexts however modern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications for many cases a chosen plaintext attack is often very feasible see also in practice chosen plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography where the encryption key is public and so attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose there are two forms of chosen plaintext attacks a general batch chosen plaintext attack is carried out as follows consider the following extension of the above

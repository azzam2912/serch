it is a white solid ktp is an important nonlinear optical material that is commonly used for frequency doubling diode pumped solid state lasers such as nd yag and other neodymium doped lasers the compound is prepared by the reaction of titanium dioxide with a mixture of khpo and khpo near 1300 k the potassium salts serve both as reagents and flux the material has been characterized by x ray crystallography ktp has an orthorhombic crystal structure it features octahedral ti iv and tetrahedral phosphate sites potassium has a high coordination number all heavy atoms ti p k are linked exclusively by oxides which interconnect these atoms crystals of ktp are highly transparent for wavelengths between 350 2700 nm with a reduced transmission out to 4500 nm where the crystal is effectively opaque its second harmonic generation shg coefficient is about three times higher than kdp it has a mohs hardness of about 5 ktp is also used as an optical parametric oscillator for near ir generation up to 4 m it is particularly suited to high power operation as an optical parametric oscillator due to its high damage threshold and large crystal aperture the high degree of birefringent walk

since the tees newport bridge had its lifting deck permanently fixed in the down position in 1990 large shipping can no longer reach the tees viaduct further reducing the need for such a high structure the bridge was built between 1973 and 1975 encompassing the three day week and that may account for some of its subsequent problems the viaduct was opened in november 1975 the bridge has had problems with corrosion since it was opened and repairs have been necessary at times expansion joints cracked allowing de icing salts to wash from the bridge carriageway into the piers cross beams and columns giving rise to extensive chloride attack it was then decided the best solution was the complete demolition and reconstruction of most of the piers and repair of others the bridge was originally constructed with two lane carriageways and a concrete apron up to the parapet but this was expanded to three lanes from 1988 to 1989 the underside of the bridge was enclosed with a steel and grp panelling structure to protect the primary structure from the effects of weather and to allow safe and easy inspection and maintenance the a19 including the tees viaduct is operated

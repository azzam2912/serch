it has an apparent visual magnitude of 3 93 which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye based upon parallax measurements it is approximately 141 light years from the sun the companion is a magnitude 9 7 star at an angular separation of 16 7 based upon their motion through space this system made its perihelion passage some 858 000 years ago when it came within of the sun it is currently moving away with a radial velocity of 48 km s the primary component is k type giant star with a stellar classification of k0 iii it has a derived luminosity of around 53 times that of the sun 1 74 times the sun s mass and is about 5 27 billion years old the measured angular diameter of this star is mas at the estimated distance of zeta volantis this yields a physical size of about 11 times the radius of the sun the expanded outer envelope has an effective temperature of 4 721 k giving it the orange glow of a k type star end align

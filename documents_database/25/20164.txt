similarly an element of a ring is called a right zero divisor if there exists a nonzero such that this is a partial case of divisibility in rings an element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a zero divisor an element that is both a left and a right zero divisor is called a two sided zero divisor the nonzero such that may be different from the nonzero such that if the ring is commutative then the left and right zero divisors are the same an element of a ring that is not a zero divisor is called regular or a non zero divisor a zero divisor that is nonzero is called a nonzero zero divisor or a nontrivial zero divisor if there are no nontrivial zero divisors in then is a domain there is no need for a separate convention regarding the case because the definition applies also in this case such properties are needed in order to make the following general statements true some references choose to exclude as a zero divisor by convention but then they must introduce exceptions in the two general statements just made let be a commutative ring

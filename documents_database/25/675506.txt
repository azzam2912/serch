under the exhaustive ballot the elector simply casts a single vote for their chosen candidate however if no candidate is supported by an overall majority of votes then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and a further round of voting occurs this process is repeated for as many rounds as necessary until one candidate has a majority the exhaustive ballot is similar to the two round system but with key differences under the two round system if no candidate wins a majority on the first round only the top two recipients of votes advance to the second and final round of voting and a majority winner is determined in the second round by contrast on the exhaustive ballot only one candidate is eliminated per round thus several rounds of voting may be required until a candidate reaches a majority in some circumstances the two or more lowest candidates can be eliminated simultaneously if together they have fewer votes than the lowest candidate above them in other words this bulk exclusion cannot change the order of elimination unlike a two round system because voters may have to cast votes several times the exhaustive ballot is not used in large

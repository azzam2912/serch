it quantifies the observation that given enough time even a solid like material might flow or a fluid like material can act solid when it is deformed rapidly enough materials that have low relaxation times flow easily and as such show relatively rapid stress decay the deborah number is the ratio of fundamentally different characteristic times formally the deborah number is defined as the ratio of the time it takes for a material to adjust to applied stresses or deformations and the characteristic time scale of an experiment or a computer simulation probing the response of the material where stands for the relaxation time and for the time of observation typically taken to be the time scale of the process the numerator relaxation time is the time needed for a reference amount of deformation to occur under a suddenly applied reference load a more fluid like material will therefore require less time to flow giving a lower deborah number relative to a solid subjected to the same loading rate the denominator material time is the amount of time required to reach a given reference strain a faster loading rate will therefore reach the reference strain sooner giving a higher deborah

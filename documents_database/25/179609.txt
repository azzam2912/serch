this kind of trap is particularly well suited to precision measurements of properties of ions and stable subatomic particles geonium atoms have been created and studied this way to measure the electron magnetic moment recently these traps have been used in the physical realization of quantum computation and quantum information processing by trapping qubits penning traps are used in many laboratories worldwide including cern to store antimatter like antiprotons the penning trap was named after f m penning 1894 1953 by hans georg dehmelt 1922 2017 who built the first trap dehmelt got inspiration from the vacuum gauge built by f m penning where a current through a discharge tube in a magnetic field is proportional to the pressure citing from h dehmelt s autobiography i began to focus on the magnetron penning discharge geometry which in the penning ion gauge had caught my interest already at g ttingen and at duke in their 1955 cyclotron resonance work on photoelectrons in vacuum franken and liebes had reported undesirable frequency shifts caused by accidental electron trapping their analysis made me realize that in a pure electric quadrupole field the shift would not depend on the location of the electron in the

cge models are also referred to as age applied general equilibrium models a cge model consists of equations describing model variables and a database usually very detailed consistent with these model equations the equations tend to be neo classical in spirit often assuming cost minimizing behaviour by producers average cost pricing and household demands based on optimizing behaviour however most cge models conform only loosely to the theoretical general equilibrium paradigm for example they may allow for a cge model database consists of cge models are descended from the input output models pioneered by wassily leontief but assign a more important role to prices thus where leontief assumed that say a fixed amount of labour was required to produce a ton of iron a cge model would normally allow wage levels to negatively affect labour demands cge models derive too from the models for planning the economies of poorer countries constructed usually by a foreign expert from 1960 onwards compared to the leontief model development planning models focused more on constraints or shortages of skilled labour capital or foreign exchange cge modelling of richer economies descends from leif johansen s 1960 msg model of norway and the static model developed

it is most closely related in structure to the gaba antagonist flumazenil although its effects are somewhat different it is classified as a high potency benzodiazepine due to its high affinity binding to benzodiazepine binding sites where it acts as a partial agonist its profile as a partial agonist and preclinical trial data suggests that it may have a reduced adverse effect profile in particular bretazenil has been proposed to cause a less strong development of tolerance and withdrawal syndrome bretazenil differs from traditional 1 4 benzodiazepines by being a partial agonist and because it binds to and subunit containing gaba receptor benzodiazepine receptor complexes 1 4 benzodiazepines bind only to and gaba benzodiazepine receptor complexes bretazenil was originally developed as an anti anxiety drug and has been studied for its use as an anticonvulsant but has never commercialised it is a partial agonist for gaba receptors in the brain david nutt from the university of bristol has suggested bretazenil as a possible base from which to make a better social drug as it displays several of the positive effects of alcohol intoxication such as relaxation and sociability but without the bad effects such as aggression amnesia nausea loss of

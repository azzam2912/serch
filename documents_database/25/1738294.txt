he currently holds the title of distinguished professor at the graduate center of the city university of new york where he is the founder and head of its research laboratory for logic and computation his research interests include proof theory and logic in computer science optimal control and hybrid systems automated deduction and verification epistemology and epistemic game theory he is best known for his invention of logics of proofs and justifications in the area of proof theory artemov established the impossibility of finding a complete axiom system for first order provability logic 1985 and has pioneered studies of the logic of proofs his major accomplishments include the solution of a problem that was discussed by g del in the 1930s artemov provided a provability semantics for modal logic that also served as a formalization of the brouwer heyting kolmogorov provability semantics for intuitionistic logic 1995 he later offered a general logical theory of justification that renders a new evidence based foundation for epistemic logic 2007 2008 the notion of justification has been an essential element of epistemic studies since plato but was prior to artemov s work conspicuously absent in logical models of knowledge artemov along with researchers from

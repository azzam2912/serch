this phenomenon is seen in some early hominid ancestors such as paranthropus aethiopicus the evidence for post canine megadontia comes from measuring post canine tooth surface area of hominid specimens and comparing these measurements to other hominid species australopithecus dated to have lived 2 to 3 million years ago is the earliest hominid genus to demonstrate post canine enlargement with average post canine tooth area ranging from approximately 460mm and going all the way up to the largest tooth area 756mm which is seen in paranthropus boisei after australopithecus a trend of steady decline in post canine size is observed starting in the genus homo and culminating with homo sapiens which has an average post canine tooth area of only 334mm studies of premolar size in hominid species that predate australopithecus afarensis show long uni cuspid teeth at the p location while species dated after a afarensis have been shown to have wider bicuspid teeth at the same location which is hypothesized to show the beginnings of canine to premolar evolution in hominids homo floresiensis a hominid species from the late pleistocene found in cave deposits in liang bua indonesia shows a smaller molar size that is closer to the

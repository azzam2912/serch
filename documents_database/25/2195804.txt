the term originated from within anthropology and typically referred to the creation of digital photographs of ethnographic material which would then be made available to members of the originating culture however the term has also been applied to museum library and archives collections and can refer not only to digital photographs but digital collections and virtual exhibits including 3d scans and audio recordings digital repatriation is becoming increasingly relevant as more cultural institutions make their collections available online this increased access is sometimes at odds with the desires of the originating culture since it limits their ability to curate and define terms of access to their cultural materials many cultural institutions are making efforts to involve communities in collection display and description proponents of digital surrogacy argue that it can offer benefits to originating cultures scholars and educators for originating cultures digital surrogates can make cultural objects accessible to dispersed populations reunite collections of physically scattered objects or provide access to objects for which physical repatriation is challenging digital surrogates can provide an interactive experience for community members and inspire new community engagement with cultural objects high quality digital surrogates can aid with preservation of the original objects provide documentation

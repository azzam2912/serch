irf4 is a transcription factor that has been implicated in acute leukemia this gene is strongly associated with pigmentation sensitivity of skin to sun exposure freckles blue eyes and brown hair color a variant has been implicated in greying of hair the world health organization 2016 provisionally defined large b cell lymphoma with irf4 rearrangement as a rare indolent large b cell lymphoma of children and adolescents this indolent lymphoma mimics and must be distinguished from pediatric type follicular lymphoma the hallmark of large b cell lymphoma with irf4 rearrangement is the overexpression of the irf4 gene by the disease s malignant cells this overexpression is forced by the acquisition in these cells of a translocation of irf4 from its site on the short i e p arm of chromosome 6 at position 25 3 to a site near the igh immunoglobulin heavy locus on the long i e q arm of chromosome 14 at position 32 33 irf4 has been shown to interact with

it is a white crystalline powder it has been extensively tested for use in commercial secondary batteries an application that exploits its high solubility in nonpolar solvents although bf has high ionic mobility solutions of its li salt are less conductive than other less associated salts as an electrolyte in lithium ion batteries libf offers some advantages relative to the more common lipf it exhibits greater thermal stability and moisture tolerance for example libf can tolerate a moisture content up to 620 ppm at room temperature whereas lipf readily hydrolyzes into toxic pof and hf gases often destroying the battery s electrode materials disadvantages of the electrolyte include a relatively low conductivity and difficulties forming a stable solid electrolyte interface with graphite electrodes because libf and other alkali metal salts thermally decompose to evolve boron trifluoride the salt is commonly used as a convenient source of the chemical at the laboratory scale libf is a byproduct in the industrial synthesis of diborane libf can also be synthesized from lif and bf in an appropriate solvent that is resistant to fluorination by bf e g hf brf or liquified so

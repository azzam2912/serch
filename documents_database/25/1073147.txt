the contemporary writer lucian reports that he was an utter fraud the god glycon was supposedly constructed out of a glove puppet the vivid narrative of his career given by lucian might be taken as fictitious but for the corroboration of certain coins of the emperors lucius verus and marcus aurelius and of a statue of alexander said by athenagoras to have stood in the forum of parium there is further evidence from inscriptions lucian describes him as having swindled many people and engaged through his followers in various forms of thuggery the strength of lucian s venom against alexander is attributed to alexander s hate of the epicureans lucian admired the works of epicurus a eulogy of which concludes the piece and whether or not alexander was the master of fraud and deceit as portrayed by lucian he may not have been too different from other oracles of the age when a great deal of dishonest exploitation occurred in some shrines not much is known about the early life of alexander he apparently worked in travelling medicine shows around greece and might have been a prophet of the goddess soi or a follower of apollonius of tyana in lucian

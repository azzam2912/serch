jags has been employed for statistical work in many fields for example ecology management and genetics jags aims for compatibility with winbugs openbugs through the use of a dialect of the same modeling language informally bugs but it provides no gui for model building and mcmc sample postprocessing which must therefore be treated in a separate program for example calling jags from r through a library such as rjags and post processing mcmc output in r the main advantage of jags in comparison to the members of the original bugs family winbugs and openbugs is its platform independence it is written in c while the bugs family is written in component pascal a less widely known programming language in addition jags is already part of many repositories of linux distributions such as ubuntu it can also be compiled as a 64 bit application on 64 bit platforms thus making all the addressable space available to bugs models jags can be used via the command line or run in batch mode through script files this means that there is no need to redo the settings with every run and that the program can be called and controlled from within another program

cyphophthalmi comprises 36 genera and more than two hundred described species the six families are currently grouped into three infraorders the boreophthalmi scopulophthalmi and sternophthalmi cyphophthalmi are smaller than the more familiar daddy long legs harvestmen with adults ranging from 1 to 7 mm in length moreover their legs are relatively short compared to most other harvestmen typically shorter than the body some superficially resemble mites which is where they get their common name their coloration is almost always some shade of brown with a heavily sclerotized body and they are quite inconspicuous residing in leaf litter or in caves many cyphophthalmi are eyeless and presumably rely on olfactory cues to find food and mates very little is known about their behavior though they likely subsist mostly by scavenging and preying on minute arthropods they have low dispersal rates and consequently high endemism cyphophthalmi differ from other harvestmen in a number of key ways like all harvestmen they have a pair of ozopores located on the sides of the prosoma unlike other harvestmen however the ozopores in cyphophthalmi are located on elevated cone shaped structures known as ozophores although members of most families are eyeless most members of the families

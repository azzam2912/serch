as a result some early journalistic accounts of the cell s capabilities now differ from production hardware powerpoint material accompanying an sti presentation given by dr peter hofstee includes a photograph of the dd2 cell die overdrawn with functional unit boundaries which are also captioned by name which reveals the breakdown of silicon area by function unit as follows additional details concerning the internal spe implementation have been disclosed by ibm engineers including peter hofstee ibm s chief architect of the synergistic processing element in a scholarly ieee publication this document includes a photograph of the 2 54 x 5 81 mm spe as implemented in 90 nm soi in this technology the spe contains 21 million transistors of which 14 million are contained in arrays a term presumably designating register files and the local store and 7 million transistors are logic this photograph is overdrawn with functional unit boundaries which are also captioned by name which reveals the breakdown of silicon area by function unit as follows understanding the dispatch pipes is important to write efficient code in the spu architecture two instructions can be dispatched started in each clock cycle using dispatch pipes designated even and odd the

this heartfelt tribute album has enough unique moments to make it easily recommended on all about jazz c michael bailey observed golson s i remember miles covers five of the miles davis book standards and four golson originals the latter being more interesting than the former this disc on the whole is a sleeper it is well arranged and performed but with no fire it fairly pales when listened to during the same afternoon with shirley horn s i remember miles while golson and company offer a decent record i recommend the same expenditure for the shirley horn disc if the listener is trying to choose between the two all compositions by benny golson except where noted

the wasp is unusual in modifying the spider s web building behavior to make a web made of very strong lines designed to support the wasp s cocoon without breaking in the rain the adult female wasp temporarily paralyzes the spider and lays an egg on its abdomen the egg hatches into a larva which sucks the spider s hemolymph through small holes while the spider goes on about its normal web building and insect catching behavior for the next one to two weeks when the larva is ready to pupate it injects a chemical into the spider causing it to build a web the design of which is completely different from any it has ever made and then to sit motionless in the middle of this web even if the larva is removed prior to the web building process the spider still engages in aberrant web spinning the wasp larva then molts kills the spider with a poison and sucks its body dry before discarding it and building a cocoon that hangs from the middle of the web the spider has just built the larva pupates inside the cocoon then emerges to mate and begin the cycle over again

often used to refer to architecture and physical culture the term addresses the combination of anglo saxon and norman styles prevalent during the period in the years before the conquest various saxo norman features emerged in english architecture including long and short stonework half roll features on arches and double splay windows after the conquest saxo norman architecture was typically applied to smaller buildings and small parts of larger projects major ecclesiastical projects such as cathedrals and abbey churches were executed in a predominantly norman style at exeter castle for example anglo saxon long and short stonework was used in the gatehouse alongside arches common to both norman and anglo saxon styles and some features borrowed from the holy roman empire one of the reasons for this would have been the limited number of norman craftsmen available for projects and the continuity of local anglo saxon preferences in many locations some anglo saxon architectural features were never used under the normans and as time went by some saxo norman features began to fade old anglo saxon features such as brick arches in stone buildings were simply eliminated from new designs and long and short stonework half roll features slowly disappeared

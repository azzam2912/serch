in the case of the three main composite video standards pal video has an 8 field 4 frame color frame sequence and ntsc and secam both have 4 field 2 frame color frame sequences preserving the color framing sequence of video across edits and between channels in video effects was an important issue in early analog composite videotape editing systems as cuts between different color sequences would cause jumps in subcarrier phase and mixing two signals of different field dominance would result in color artifacts on the part of the signal that was not in sync with the output color frame sequence to help prevent these problems smpte time code contains a color framing bit which can be used to indicate that the video material the timecode refers to follows a standard convention regarding the synchronization of video time code and the color framing sequence if the color framing bit was set in both types of material the editing system could then always ensure that color framing was preserved by constraining edit decisions between input sources to keep the correct relationship between the timecode sequences and hence the color framing sequences color framing has become largely an issue of historical

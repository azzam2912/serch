generally the goal of a navigation function is to create feasible safe paths that avoid obstacles while allowing a robot to move from its starting configuration to its goal configuration potential functions assume that the environment or work space is known obstacles are assigned a high potential value and the goal position is assigned a low potential to reach the goal position a robot only needs to follow the negative gradient of the surface we can formalize this concept mathematically as following let formula 1 be the state space of all possible configurations of a robot let formula 2 denote the goal region of the state space then a potential function formula 3 is called a feasible navigation function if while for certain applications it suffices to have a feasible navigation function in many cases it is desirable to have an optimal navigation function with respect to a given cost functional formula 11 formalized as an optimal control problem we can write whereby formula 14 is the state formula 15 is the control to apply formula 16 is a cost at a certain state formula 14 if we apply a control formula 15 and formula 19 models the transition dynamics

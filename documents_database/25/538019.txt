the idea of a reactor was proposed at the kurchatov institute by savely moiseevich feinberg vver were originally developed before the 1970s and have been continually updated as a result the name vver is associated with a wide variety of reactor designs spanning from generation i reactors to modern generation iii designs power output ranges from 70 to 1300 mwe with designs of up to 1700 mwe in development the first prototype vver 210 was built at the novovoronezh nuclear power plant vver power stations have been mostly installed in russia and the former soviet union but also in china finland germany hungary slovakia bulgaria india and iran countries that are planning to introduce vver reactors include bangladesh egypt jordan and turkey the earliest vvers were built before 1970 the vver 440 model v230 was the most common design delivering 440 mw of electrical power the v230 employs six primary coolant loops each with a horizontal steam generator a modified version of vver 440 model v213 was a product of the first nuclear safety standards adopted by soviet designers this model includes added emergency core cooling and auxiliary feedwater systems as well as upgraded accident localization systems the larger vver

calcium acts both to modulate intracellular signaling as a secondary messenger and to facilitate structural changes as cells progress through division exquisite control of intracellular calcium dynamics are required as calcium appears to play a role at multiple cell cycle checkpoints the major downstream calcium effectors are the calcium binding calmodulin protein and downstream calmodulin dependent protein kinases i ii evidence points to this signaling cascade as a major mediator of calcium signaling in cell division historically one of the most well characterized roles of intracellular calcium is activation of the ovum after sperm fertilization in deuterosome eggs mammals fish amphibians ascidians sea urchins etc successful sperm entry leads to a distinct rise in intracellular calcium ions ca with mammals and ascidians displaying a series of intracellular calcium spikes required for completion of meiosis unfertilized vertebrate eggs arrest development after meiosis i this developmental pause is attributed to the vaguely defined cytostatic factor csf current research suggest csf is actually multiple pathways working together to halt division at metaphase of meiosis ii upon sperm entry into the egg ca is released from intracellular stores leading to inhibition of the csf arrest mechanism calmodulin dependent kinase ii was shown to be

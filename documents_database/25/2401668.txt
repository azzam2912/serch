2a peptides are derived from the 2a region in the genome of virus the members of 2a peptides are named after the virus in which they have been first described for example f2a the first described 2a peptide is derived from foot and mouth disease virus four members of 2a peptides family are frequently used in life science research they are p2a e2a f2a and t2a f2a is derived from foot and mouth disease virus 18 e2a is derived from equine rhinitis a virus p2a is derived from porcine teschovirus 1 2a t2a is derived from thosea asigna virus 2a the following table shows the sequences of four members of 2a peptides adding the sequence gsg gly ser gly on the n terminal of a 2a peptide is optional the 2a peptide mediated cleavage commences after the translation the cleavage is trigged by breaking of peptide bond between the proline p and glycine g in c terminal of 2a peptide the exact molecular mechanism of 2a peptide mediated cleavage is still unknown however it is believed to involve ribosomal skipping of glycyl prolyl peptide bond formation rather than true proteolytic cleavage in genetic engineering the 2a peptides are used to

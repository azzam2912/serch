they grow on amino acids in their aerobic conditions their cell walls are also quite different from those of bacteria as ordinary lipoprotein membranes fail in high salt concentrations in shape they may be either rods or cocci and in color either red or purple they reproduce using binary fission by constriction and are motile halobacterium grows best in a 42 c environment the genome of an unspecified halobacterium species sequenced by shiladitya dassarma comprises 2 571 010 bp base pairs of dna compiled into three circular strands one large chromosome with 2 014 239 bp and two smaller ones with 191 346 and 365 425 bp this species called halobacterium sp nrc 1 has been extensively used for postgenomic analysis halobacterium species can be found in the great salt lake the dead sea lake magadi and any other waters with high salt concentration purple halobacterium species owe their color to bacteriorhodopsin a light sensitive protein which provides chemical energy for the cell by using sunlight to pump protons out of the cell the resulting proton gradient across the cell membrane is used to drive the synthesis of the energy carrier atp thus when these protons flow back in they

abrikosov vortices occur generically in the ginzburg landau theory of superconductivity and can be explicitly demonstrated as solutions to that theory in a general mathematical setting viz as vortices in complex line bundles on riemannian manifolds the supercurrent circulates around the normal i e non superconducting core of the vortex the core has a size formula 1 the superconducting coherence length parameter of a ginzburg landau theory the supercurrents decay on the distance about formula 2 london penetration depth from the core note that in type ii superconductors formula 3 the circulating supercurrents induce magnetic fields with the total flux equal to a single flux quantum formula 4 therefore an abrikosov vortex is often called a fluxon the magnetic field distribution of a single vortex far from its core can be described by formula 5 where formula 6 is a zeroth order bessel function note that according to the above formula at formula 7 the magnetic field formula 8 i e logarithmically diverges in reality for formula 9 the field is simply given by formula 10 where is known as the ginzburg landau parameter which must be formula 11 in type ii superconductors abrikosov vortices can be trapped in a

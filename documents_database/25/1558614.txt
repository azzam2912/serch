the vertices with one neighbor are the leaves of the tree and the remaining vertices are the internal nodes of the tree the degree of a vertex is its number of neighbors in a tree with more than one node the leaves are the vertices of degree one an unrooted binary tree is a free tree in which all internal nodes have degree exactly three in some applications it may make sense to distinguish subtypes of unrooted binary trees a planar embedding of the tree may be fixed by specifying a cyclic ordering for the edges at each vertex making it into a plane tree in computer science binary trees are often rooted and ordered when they are used as data structures but in the applications of unrooted binary trees in hierarchical clustering and evolutionary tree reconstruction unordered trees are more common additionally one may distinguish between trees in which all vertices have distinct labels trees in which the leaves only are labeled and trees in which the nodes are not labeled in an unrooted binary tree with n leaves there will be n 2 internal nodes so the labels may be taken from the set of integers from 1

this natural process is caused by the dynamic activity of erosive agents that is water ice glaciers snow air wind plants animals and humans in accordance with these agents erosion is sometimes divided into water erosion glacial erosion snow erosion wind aeolic erosion zoogenic erosion and anthropogenic erosion the particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as physical or mechanical erosion this contrasts with chemical erosion where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent typically water followed by the flow away of that solution eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres or for thousands of kilometres natural rates of erosion are controlled by the action of geological weathering geomorphic drivers such as rainfall bedrock wear in rivers coastal erosion by the sea and waves glacial plucking abrasion and scour areal flooding wind abrasion groundwater processes and mass movement processes in steep landscapes like landslides and debris flows the rates at which such processes act control how fast a surface is eroded typically physical erosion proceeds fastest on steeply sloping surfaces and rates may also be sensitive to some climatically controlled properties including amounts

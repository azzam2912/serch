however with proper design and construction the damage to buildings by these forces can be greatly reduced a variety of methods can help a building survive strong winds and storm surge waves along coastal areas can destroy many buildings buildings should preferably be built on high ground in order to avoid waves if waves can reach the building site the building ought to be elevated on steel concrete or wooden pilings or anchored to solid rock wind acting on the roof surfaces of a building can cause negative pressures that create a lifting force sufficient to lift the roof off the building once this occurs the building is weakened considerably and the rest of the building will likely fail as well to minimize this vulnerability the upper structure ought to be anchored through the walls to the foundation several methods can be used to anchor the roof typically roof trusses are toenailed into the top of the walls which provide insufficient force to resist high winds hurricane ties nail into the wall and wrap over the trusses to provide higher force resistance interlocking metal pan roof systems installed on mobile homes can fail under the pressure differential lift created by

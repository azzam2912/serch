objects smaller than this are classified as micrometeoroids or space dust most are fragments from comets or asteroids whereas others are collision impact debris ejected from bodies such as the moon or mars when a meteoroid comet or asteroid enters earth s atmosphere at a speed typically in excess of aerodynamic heating of that object produces a streak of light both from the glowing object and the trail of glowing particles that it leaves in its wake this phenomenon is called a meteor or shooting star a series of many meteors appearing seconds or minutes apart and appearing to originate from the same fixed point in the sky is called a meteor shower if that object withstands ablation from its passage through the atmosphere as a meteor and impacts with the ground it is then called a meteorite an estimated 25 million meteoroids micrometeoroids and other space debris enter earth s atmosphere each day which results in an estimated 15 000 tonnes of that material entering the atmosphere each year in 1961 the international astronomical union iau defined a meteoroid as a solid object moving in interplanetary space of a size considerably smaller than an asteroid and considerably larger than

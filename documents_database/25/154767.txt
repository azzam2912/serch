most of their molecules consist of a chromophore which makes them coloured they are unique among the photosynthetic pigments in that they are bonded to certain water soluble proteins known as phycobiliproteins phycobiliproteins then pass the light energy to chlorophylls for photosynthesis the phycobilins are especially efficient at absorbing red orange yellow and green light wavelengths that are not well absorbed by chlorophyll a organisms growing in shallow waters tend to contain phycobilins that can capture yellow red light while those at greater depth often contain more of the phycobilins that can capture green light which is relatively more abundant there the phycobilins fluoresce at a particular wavelength and are therefore often used in research as chemical tags e g by binding phycobiliproteins to antibodies in a technique known as immunofluorescence there are four types of phycobilins they can be found in different combinations attached to phycobiliproteins to confer specific spectroscopic properties in chemical terms phycobilins consist of an open chain of four pyrrole rings tetrapyrrole and are structurally similar to the bile pigment bilirubin which explains the name bilirubin s conformation is also affected by light a fact used for the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns phycobilins are also closely

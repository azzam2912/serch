since introduction in the 1960s annual production has increased to 870 000 metric tons epm is considered a valuable elastomer due to its useful chemical and physical properties it is resistant to heat oxidation ozone and the weather owing to its stable saturated backbone and it is also not susceptible to color loss as a non polar compound epm is an electrical resistor and it is insoluble in many polar solvents both protic and aprotic amorphous forms of epm are flexible at low temperatures with glass transition points around 60 c via selection of certain sulfur compounds epm can remain heat resistant up to 130 c and up to 160 c with peroxide curing these two tables contain some of the main properties of epm epm has a large number of uses due to the many ways in which the polymer can be designed for example it is used in automotive weather stripping and seals self amalgamating tape glass run channels radiators garden and appliance hoses tubing belts roofing membranes expansion joints rubber mechanical goods plastic impact modification thermoplastic vulcanisates and motor oil additive applications epm is even more prevalent as an insulator for high voltage cables since it has

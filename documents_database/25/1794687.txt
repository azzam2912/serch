k here signifies the number of colors of edges that are involved in the graph if k 1 k graph is just a regular directed graph if k 2 there are two different colors of edges involved in the graph and additional factorization rules of 2 color equivalent classes should be defined the factorization rule on k graph skeleton is what distinguishes one k graph defined on the same skeleton from another k graph k can be any natural number greater than or equal to 1 the reason k graphs were first introduced by kumjian pask et al was to create examples of c algebra from them k graphs consist of two parts skeleton and factorization rules defined on the given skeleton once k graph is well defined one can define functions called 2 cocycles on each graph and c algebras can be built from k graphs and 2 cocycles k graphs are relatively simple to understand from graph theory perspective yet just complicated enough to reveal different interesting properties in the c algebra level the properties such as homotopy and cohomology on the 2 cocycles defined on k graphs have implications to c algebra and k theory research efforts

the high performance computing cluster is operated by information technology at purdue itap the university s central information technology organization itap also operates clusters named steele built in 2008 rossmann built in 2010 and hansen and carter built in 2011 coates was the largest campus supercomputer in the big ten outside a national center when built it was the first native 10 gigabit ethernet 10gige cluster to be ranked in the top500 and placed 102nd on the june 2010 list the coates cluster consists of 982 64 bit 8 core hp proliant dl165 g5p and 11 64 bit 16 core hp proliant dl585 g5 systems using amd 2380 and amd 8380 processors with various combinations of 16 128 gigabytes of ram 500 gb to 2 terabytes of disk and 10 gigabit ethernet 10gige local to each node coates uses cisco and chelsio network equipment the cluster s nodes are arrayed in five logical sub clusters each with different memory and storage configurations designed to meet the varying needs of the researchers using coates coates nodes run red hat enterprise linux 5 6 rhel5 6 and use portable batch system professional 10 4 6 pbspro 10 4 6 for resource and

frobenius algebras began to be studied in the 1930s by brauer and nesbitt and were named after frobenius nakayama discovered the beginnings of a rich duality theory dieudonn used this to characterize frobenius algebras frobenius algebras were generalized to quasi frobenius rings those noetherian rings whose right regular representation is injective in recent times interest has been renewed in frobenius algebras due to connections to topological quantum field theory a finite dimensional unital associative algebra a defined over a field k is said to be a frobenius algebra if a is equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form a a k that satisfies the following equation a b c a b c this bilinear form is called the frobenius form of the algebra equivalently one may equip a with a linear functional a k such that the kernel of contains no nonzero left ideal of a a frobenius algebra is called symmetric if is symmetric or equivalently satisfies a b b a there is also a different mostly unrelated notion of the symmetric algebra of a vector space in category theory the notion of frobenius object is an abstract definition of a frobenius algebra in a category a frobenius object formula

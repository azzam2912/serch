graph kernels can be intuitively understood as functions measuring the similarity of pairs of graphs they allow kernelized learning algorithms such as support vector machines to work directly on graphs without having to do feature extraction to transform them to fixed length real valued feature vectors they find applications in bioinformatics in chemoinformatics as a type of molecule kernels and in social network analysis concepts of graph kernels have been around since the 1999 when d haussler introduced convolutional kernels on discrete structures the term graph kernels was more officially coined in 2002 by r i kondor and john lafferty as kernels on graphs i e similarity functions between the nodes of a single graph with the world wide web hyperlink graph as a suggested application in 2003 gaertner et al and kashima et al defined kernels between graphs in 2010 vishwanathan et al gave their unified framework in 2018 ghosh et al described the history of graph kernels and their evolution over two decades an example of a kernel between graphs is the random walk kernel which conceptually performs random walks on two graphs simultaneously then counts the number of paths that were produced by both walks this is

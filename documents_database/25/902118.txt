the algorithm is expected to find better and better solutions the longer it keeps running most algorithms run to completion they provide a single answer after performing some fixed amount of computation in some cases however the user may wish to terminate the algorithm prior to completion the amount of computation required may be substantial for example and computational resources might need to be reallocated most algorithms either run to completion or they provide no useful solution information anytime algorithms however are able to return a partial answer whose quality depends on the amount of computation they were able to perform the answer generated by anytime algorithms is an approximation of the correct answer an anytime algorithm may be also called an interruptible algorithm they are different from contract algorithms which must declare a time in advance in an anytime algorithm a process can just announce that it is terminating the goal of anytime algorithms are to give intelligent systems the ability to make results of better quality in return for turn around time they are also supposed to be flexible in time and resources they are important because artificial intelligence or ai algorithms can take a long time to

it has important applications in magnetic reconnection coronal mass ejections condensed matter physics in pattern theory and computational vision and in option pricing in crystals atomic diffusion typically consists of jumps between vacant lattice sites on time and length scales that average over many single jumps the net motion of the jumping atoms can be described as regular diffusion jump diffusion can be studied on a microscopic scale by inelastic neutron scattering and by m bauer spectroscopy closed expressions for the autocorrelation function have been derived for several jump diffusion models in option pricing a jump diffusion model is a form of mixture model mixing a jump process and a diffusion process jump diffusion models have been introduced by robert c merton as an extension of jump models due to their computational tractability the special case of a basic affine jump diffusion is popular for some credit risk and short rate models in pattern theory and computational vision in medical imaging jump diffusion processes were first introduced by grenander and miller as a form of random sampling algorithm which mixes focus like motions the diffusion processes with saccade like motions via jump processes the approach modelled sciences of electron micrographs

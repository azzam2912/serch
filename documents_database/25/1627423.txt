bacteria serve as natural hosts there are currently 15 species in this subfamily divided among 3 genera since the 1990s the term t7 supergroup has been coined for the expanding group of bacteriophages related to coliphage t7 as members of the family podoviridae enterobacteriaceae phages sp6 and k1 5 were the first to be considered as an estranged subgroup of the t7 supergroup pseudomonas phage phikmv also shared commonalities at the genome organizational level as such based on the available morphological and proteomic data this clade of viruses was established as a subfamily of the family podoviridae the name of this subfamily termed autographivirinae refers to the auto graphein or self transcribing phages which encode their own single subunit rna polymerase a common characteristic among its members viruses in autographivirinae are non enveloped with icosahedral and head tail geometries and t 7 symmetry the diameter is around 60 nm genomes are linear around 40 42kb in length viral replication is cytoplasmic dna templated transcription is the method of transcription the virus exits the host cell by lysis and holin endolysin spanin proteins bacteria serve as the natural host transmission routes are passive diffusion group dsdna currently the autographivirinae are subdivided

it was first proved by hassler whitney in 1957 and is an important tool in the field of approximation theory for obtaining upper estimates on the errors of best approximation denote the value of the best uniform approximation of a function formula 1 by algebraic polynomials formula 2 of degree formula 3 by the moduli of smoothness of order formula 5 of a function formula 1 are defined as where formula 9 is the finite difference of order formula 5 theorem whitney 1957 if formula 1 then where formula 13 is a constant depending only on formula 5 the whitney constant formula 15 is the smallest value of formula 13 for which the above inequality holds the theorem is particularly useful when applied on intervals of small length leading to good estimates on the error of spline approximation the original proof given by whitney follows an analytic argument which utilizes the properties of moduli of smoothness however it can also be proved in a much shorter way using peetre s k functionals let where formula 20 is the lagrange polynomial for formula 21 at the nodes formula 22 now fix some formula 23 and choose formula 24 for which formula

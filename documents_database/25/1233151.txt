this is done by physically breaking out or disconnecting when pulling out of the hole every other 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe at a time called a stand and racking them vertically in the derrick when feasible the driller will start each successive trip on a different break so that after several trips fresh pipe dope will have been applied when running back in the hole to every segment of the drill string the most typical reason for tripping pipe is to replace a worn out drill bit though there are many problems that occur to warrant the tripping of pipe downhole tools such as mwd measurement while drilling lwd logging while drilling or mud motors break down quite often another common reason for tripping is to replace damaged drill pipe it is important to get the pipe out of the wellbore quickly and safely before it can snap drill bits wear and tear like most any other piece of equipment once a bit becomes too worn to drill at an adequate rate or make a full gauge hole or if the bearings are thought to be near failure a trip is undertaken to replace the bit a

black rose was the only thin lizzy album recorded while guitarist gary moore was a member of the band although he left soon after the song was recorded at pathe marconi emi studios in paris france the song opens with an african style drum beat by brian downey which gives way to twin guitar harmonies characteristic of thin lizzy s sound the lyrics include heavy use of rhyme and alliteration such as the first three lines which include the words investigate insinuate intimidate complicate wait hesitate state fate and awaits the song fades out with lead singer phil lynott doing an impersonation of elvis presley which seemed to have little to do with the meaning of the song guitarist scott gorham suggested i think he just wanted to use his american accent there the single reached no 14 in the british charts and remained in the charts for nine weeks it reached no 25 in ireland charting for two weeks an accompanying video was filmed at molineir studios directed by david mallet mallet has said that the video cost 12 15 000 to film adding most of the shoots i did with lizzy back then only lasted a day maybe

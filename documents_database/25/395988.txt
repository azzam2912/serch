a repudiation of a contract by one party the repudiating party will entitle the other party the aggrieved party to elect to terminate the contract this is based on objective intentions i e the repudiating party s words or conduct this unwillingness or inability to perform a condition must deprive the aggrieved party of substantially the whole of the benefit that they would have received if the remaining obligations were performed under the contract when such an event occurs the performing party to the contract is excused from having to fulfill his or her obligations however the repudiation can be retracted by the promising party so long as there has been no material change in the position of the performing party in the interim a retraction of the repudiation restores the performer s obligation to perform on the contract another rationale for the doctrine of repudiation is based on the breach of an implied term not rendering future performance futile o ne essential promise which is implied in every contract is that neither party will without just cause repudiate his obligations under the contract whether the time for performance has arrived or not repudiation of the contract by one party

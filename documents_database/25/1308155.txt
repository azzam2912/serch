according to that sign the quadratic form is called positive definite or negative definite a semidefinite or semi definite quadratic form is defined in the same way except that positive and negative are replaced by not negative and not positive respectively an indefinite quadratic form is one that takes on both positive and negative values more generally the definition applies to a vector space over an ordered field quadratic forms correspond one to one to symmetric bilinear forms over the same space a symmetric bilinear form is also described as definite semidefinite etc according to its associated quadratic form a quadratic form and its associated symmetric bilinear form are related by the following equations the latter formula arises from expanding formula 2 as an example let formula 3 and consider the quadratic form where formula 5 and and are constants if and the quadratic form is positive definite so q evaluates to a positive number whenever formula 6 if one of the constants is positive and the other is 0 then is positive semidefinite and always evaluates to either 0 or a positive number if and or vice versa then is indefinite and sometimes evaluates to a positive number and

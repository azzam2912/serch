it answers the question when one polygon can be formed from another by cutting it into a finite number of pieces and recomposing these by translations and rotations the wallace bolyai gerwien theorem states that this can be done if and only if two polygons have the same area farkas bolyai first formulated the question gerwien proved the theorem in 1833 but in fact wallace had proven the same result already in 1807 according to other sources bolyai and gerwien had independently proved the theorem in 1833 and 1835 respectively there are several ways in which this theorem may be formulated the most common version uses the concept of equidecomposability of polygons two polygons are equidecomposable if they can be split into finitely many triangles that only differ by some isometry in fact only by a combination of a translation and a rotation in this case the wallace bolyai gerwien theorem states that two polygons are equidecomposable if and only if they have the same area another formulation is in terms of scissors congruence two polygons are scissors congruent if they can be decomposed into finitely many polygons that are pairwise congruent scissors congruence is an equivalence relation in this

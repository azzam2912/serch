the transition from the preceding hesperian period is somewhat poorly defined the amazonian is thought to have begun around 3 billion years ago although error bars on this date are extremely large 500 million years the period is sometimes subdivided into the early middle and late amazonian the amazonian continues to the present day the amazonian system and period is named after amazonis planitia which has a sparse crater density over a wide area such densities are representative of many amazonian aged surfaces the type area of the amazonian system is in the amazonis quadrangle mc 8 around because it is the youngest of the martian periods the chronology of the amazonian is comparatively well understood through traditional geological laws of superposition coupled to the relative dating technique of crater counting the scarcity of craters characteristic of the amazonian also means that unlike the older periods fine scale sun mars and jupiter without the patterns being overwhelmed by chaotic effects and from this to reconstruct the variation of solar insolation the amount of heat from the sun reaching mars through time climatic variations have been shown to occur in cycles not dissimilar in magnitude and duration to terrestrial milankovich cycles

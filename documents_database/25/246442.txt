it replaced the company s he 60 but did not remain in service long before being replaced in turn by the arado ar 196 as germany s standard spotter aircraft while the fuselage and flotation gear of the he 114 were completely conventional its wing arrangement was highly unusual the upper set of wings was attached to the fuselage with a set of cabane struts as in a parasol wing monoplane whereas the lower set was of much lesser span while having approximately the same chord note that this general layout isn t especially unusual and is known as a sesquiplane or a biplane which has a smaller lower wing typically the lower wing is about 3 4 of the span of the upper wing and has a smaller chord as well the he 114 has a much shorter lower wing than usual but has the same chord as the upper wing which keeps the wing area ratio similar the he 114 was never a great success was not built in large numbers and served with the luftwaffe for only a short time while the he 60 had handled very well on the water but been sluggish in the air

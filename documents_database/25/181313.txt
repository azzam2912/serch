each satellite is a high density passive laser reflector in a very stable medium earth orbit meo the spacecraft are aluminum covered brass spheres with diameters of and masses of covered with 426 cube corner retroreflectors giving them the appearance of giant golf balls of these retroreflectors 422 are made from fused silica glass while the remaining 4 are made from germanium to obtain measurements in the infrared for experimental studies of reflectivity and satellite orientation they have no on board sensors or electronics and are not attitude controlled they orbit at an altitude of well above low earth orbit and well below geostationary orbit at orbital inclinations of 109 8 and 52 6 degrees measurements are made by transmitting pulsed laser beams from earth ground stations to the satellites the laser beams then return to earth after hitting the reflecting surfaces the travel times are precisely measured permitting ground stations in different parts of the earth to measure their separations to better than one inch in thousands of miles the lageos satellites make it possible to determine positions of points on the earth with extremely high accuracy due to the stability of their orbits the high mass to area

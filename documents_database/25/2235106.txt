the formula can be written chfchf it is an isomer of 1 1 difluoroethane it has a hfc name of hfc 152 with no letter suffix when cooled to cryogenic temperatures it can have different conformers gauche and trans in the liquid form these are about equally abundant and easily interconvert as a gas it is mostly the gauche form in the hfc 152 designation 2 means two fluorine atoms 5 means 5 1 or four hydrogen atoms and 1 means 1 1 or two carbon atoms ethylene reacts explosively with fluorine yielding a mixture of 1 2 difluoroethane and vinyl fluoride with solid fluorine it will react when triggered by near infrared radiation critical temperature is 107 5 c if a c h bond is over excited with too much vibration the intramolecular vibrational relaxation takes 490 picoseconds the f c c f dihedral angle is about 72 natural bond orbital deletion bond calculations show that 1 2 difluoroethane prefers the gauche conformation due to hyperconjugation effects the cis c h bonds and the c f interactions are significant the dihedral angle of about 72 is a result of decreasing hyper conjugative stability and decreasing steric destabilization chfchf reacts

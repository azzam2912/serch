the device allows musicians to bend the pitch of notes or entire chords with their pick hand for various effects the bigsby was the first successful design of what is now called a whammy bar vibrato bar or tremolo arm the latter a misnomer since vibrato is the technically correct term for the musical effect it produces tremolo is a rapid fluctuation of the volume of a note while vibrato is a fluctuation in pitch the origin of this nonstandard usage of the term by electric guitarists is attributed to leo fender who also used the term tremolo to refer to what is really a vibrato effect see vibrato unit the bigsby vibrato unit is installed on the top of the guitar and works in conjunction with a rocking bridge not a roller bridge as some may assume the arm of the bigsby is spring loaded and attached to a pivoting metal bar around which the strings of the guitar are installed in the neutral or unused position the pressure of the spring counterbalances the pull of the strings resulting in constant pitch when the strings are played when the arm of the bigsby is pushed down towards the top

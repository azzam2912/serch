xvycc was proposed by sony specified by the iec in october 2005 and published in january 2006 as iec 61966 2 4 xvycc was motivated by the fact that modern display and capture technologies often have underlying rgb primaries with significantly higher saturation than the traditional crt displays allowing them to handle a wider color gamut but these devices have been unable to do this without upsetting basic calibration as all existing video storage and transmission systems are based on crt primaries and are hence limited to the crt gamut xvycc encoded video retains the same color primaries and white point as bt 709 and uses either a bt 601 or bt 709 rgb to ycc conversion matrix and encoding this allows it to travel through existing digital ycc data paths and any colors within the normal gamut will be compatible the xvycc color space permits ycc values that while within the encoding range of ycc have chroma values outside the range 16 240 or that correspond to negative rgb values and hence would not have previously been valid these are used to encode more saturated colors for example a cyan that lies outside the basic gamut of the primaries

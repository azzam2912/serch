he is known for his work on nanorobots active matter physics plasmonics and nanophotonics and liquid helium in 2009 he along with peer fischer demonstrated the use of glancing angle deposition to fabricate magnetic helical nanoswimmers his group figured out the dynamics of such nanorobots and presented techniques for independent control of such robots in recent years his group has managed to demonstrate the various applications of helical nanorobots including techniques to move in blood this includes the use of nanorobots in active colloidal manipulation and as probes for sensing the environment inside living cells ambarish ghosh and his group has developed a wafer scale technology to fabricate porous 3d plasmonic metamaterial which can be used over a wide range of wavelengths including the visible this technology allows a wide range of materials and geometries and therefore highly versatile they have used glancing angle deposition for generating various porous 3d dielectric structures and have integrated plasmonics to develop an arrangement of metal dielectric layers in 3d very recently they have demonstrated a conceptually novel method to integrate plasmonic nanoparticles with graphene allowing them to achieve unprecedented em field enhancement and photodetection sensitivity the council of scientific and industrial research the

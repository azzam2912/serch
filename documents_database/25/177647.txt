usually located in the uninhabited area of the spacecraft the service module is jettisoned upon the completion of the mission and usually burns up during atmospheric reentry the service module is the equivalent to the spacecraft bus assembly on unmanned spacecraft depending upon the spacecraft architecture and system design a typical service module will usually contain the following while this would be used for a baseline service module a service module may also be modified for additional functions an example would be the equipment module on gemini ix a when it was modified to carry the u s air force developed astronaut maneuvering unit that would have been tested by astronaut eugene cernan but was cancelled when his spacesuit overheated causing his visor to fog up but the best example would be the final three apollo missions in which the j series service modules included scientific instrument module sim bays that took pictures and other readouts in lunar orbit in addition to the film cameras similar to those used on the lunar orbiter spacecraft and requiring the command module pilot to perform a deep space eva during the return trip two of the sim bays on apollos 15 and 16

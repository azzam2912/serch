in a process called secondary emission a single electron can when bombarded on secondary emissive material induce emission of roughly 1 to 3 electrons if an electric potential is applied between this metal plate and yet another the emitted electrons will accelerate to the next metal plate and induce secondary emission of still more electrons this can be repeated a number of times resulting in a large shower of electrons all collected by a metal anode all having been triggered by just one in 1930 russian physicist leonid aleksandrovitch kubetsky proposed a device which used photocathodes combined with dynodes or secondary electron emitters in a single tube to remove secondary electrons by increasing the electric potential through the device the electron multiplier can use any number of dynodes in total which use a coefficient and created a gain of where n is the number of emitters secondary electron emission begins when one electron hits a dynode inside a vacuum chamber and ejects electrons that cascade onto more dynodes and repeats the process over again the dynodes are set up so that each time an electron hits the next one it will have an increase of about 100 electron volts greater

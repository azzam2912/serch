aerovironment inc developed the vehicles under nasa s environmental research aircraft and sensor technology erast program they were built to develop the technologies that would allow long term high altitude aircraft to serve as atmospheric satellites to perform atmospheric research tasks as well as serve as communications platforms it was developed from the nasa pathfinder plus aircraft and was developed into the nasa helios centurion originally built for the altitude on solar power milestone specified by the erast project was the third generation aircraft in the nasa pathfinder series of electrical powered flying wing unmanned aircraft the erast program managers had determined that an aircraft based on the pathfinder pathfinder plus concept would be the lowest risk approach of achieving the altitude goal initially a quarter scale model of the centurion was test flown at el mirage dry lake on march 4 1997 the full size centurion s maiden flight took place at rogers dry lake on november 10 1998 and lasted a total of 1 hr and 24 minutes at the time it weighed in at including a steel anvil hanging on its centerline to simulate a payload for its first flight the flight was nearly flawless and was

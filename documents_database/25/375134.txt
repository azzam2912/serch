the transient flow of groundwater is described by a form of the diffusion equation similar to that used in heat transfer to describe the flow of heat in a solid heat conduction the steady state flow of groundwater is described by a form of the laplace equation which is a form of potential flow and has analogs in numerous fields the groundwater flow equation is often derived for a small representative elemental volume rev where the properties of the medium are assumed to be effectively constant a mass balance is done on the water flowing in and out of this small volume the flux terms in the relationship being expressed in terms of head by using the constituitive equation called darcy s law which requires that the flow is laminar a mass balance must be performed and used along with darcy s law to arrive at the transient groundwater flow equation this balance is analogous to the energy balance used in heat transfer to arrive at the heat equation it is simply a statement of accounting that for a given control volume aside from sources or sinks mass cannot be created or destroyed the conservation of mass states that for

it can smooth a wide variety of surface material types to within an angstrom of roughness without subsurface damage it is also used to chemically alter surfaces through infusion or deposition using gcib a surface is bombarded by a beam of high energy nanoscale cluster ions the clusters are formed when a high pressure gas approximately 10 atmospheres pressure expands into a vacuum 1e 5 atmospheres the gas expands adiabatically and cools then condenses into clusters the clusters are nano sized bits of crystalline matter with unique properties that are intermediate between the realms of atomic physics and those of solid state physics the expansion takes place inside of a nozzle that shapes the gas flow and facilitates the formation of a jet of clusters the jet of clusters passes through differential pumping apertures into a region of high vacuum 1e 8 atmospheres where the clusters are ionized by collisions with energetic electrons the ionized clusters are accelerated electrostatically to very high velocities and they are focused into a tight beam the gcib beam is then used to treat a surface typically the treated substrate is mechanically scanned in the beam to allow uniform irradiation of the surface argon is

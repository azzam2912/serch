the materials are commonly used for self lubricating plain bearings or electrical contacts they are proprietary materials owned by the graphite metallizing corp based in yonkers new york usa when the metal is impregnated in the graphite it forms long continuous filaments these are what gives the material its ductility strength and heat dissipation properties there are many types of graphalloy because the graphite can be impregnated with many different metals graphalloy is used in applications where high and low temperatures are encountered grease or oil is not feasible expulsion of wear particles is prohibited or in dusty submerged or corrosive environments it is non corrosive in gasoline jet fuel solvents bleaches caustics dyes liquefied gases acids and many more chemicals it is not used in highly abrasive applications common applications include pumps bleaching and washing tanks ovens industrial dryers steam turbines kilns cryogenics it is also used as bearing in applications where electrical conduction is necessary it is used in when high frequency current degrades ball or needle bearings examples of applications include packaging machines radar joints and welding equipment

these differ only by a basis change with respect to time dependency analogous to the lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field in short time dependence is attached to quantum states in the schr dinger picture and to operators in the heisenberg picture there is also an intermediate formulation known as the interaction picture or dirac picture which is useful for doing computations when a complicated hamiltonian has a natural decomposition into a simple free hamiltonian and a perturbation equations that apply in one picture do not necessarily hold in the others because time dependent unitary transformations relate operators in one picture to the analogous operators in the others not all textbooks and articles make explicit which picture each operator comes from which can lead to confusion in elementary quantum mechanics the state of a quantum mechanical system is represented by a complex valued wavefunction more abstractly the state may be represented as a state vector or ket this ket is an element of a hilbert space a vector space containing all possible states of the system a quantum mechanical operator is a function which takes a ket and returns some other ket the differences between the schr dinger

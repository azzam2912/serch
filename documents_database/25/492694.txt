helminths are parasitic worms such as hookworms whipworms and threadworms that have evolved to live within a host organism on which they rely for nutrients these worms are members of two phyla nematodes which are primarily used in human helminthic therapy and flat worms trematodes helminthic therapy consists of the inoculation of the patient with specific parasitic intestinal nematodes helminths a number of such organisms are currently being investigated for their use as treatment including trichuris suis ova commonly known as pig whipworm eggs necator americanus commonly known as hookworms trichuris trichiura ova commonly referred to as human whipworm eggs and hymenolepis diminuta commonly known as rat tapeworm cysticerci while the latter four species may be considered to be mutualists providing benefit to their host without causing longterm harm there are other helminth species that have demonstrated therapeutic effects but which also have a potential to cause less desirable or even harmful effects and therefore do not share the ideal characteristics for a therapeutic helminth these include ascaris lumbricoides commonly known as human giant roundworm strongyloides stercoralis commonly known as human roundworm enterobius vermicularis commonly known as pinworm or threadworm and hymenolepis nana also known as dwarf tapeworm current research

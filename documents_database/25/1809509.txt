cement content and water cement ratio are important elements hereby the comparison with standardized concrete is tested according to the following properties when the new concrete scores equally or better a certificate of utilization can be obtained from certificating organizations the valid standards concerning concrete are these national annexes serve to elaborate the functional description of the equivalent concrete performance concept standardized concrete is a highly durable material predominantly thanks to the increasing amount of cement at stricter environmental classes but cement is a costly component and has a relatively powerful impact on the environment partly because of this alternative binders such as fly ashes and slags are applied in the concrete sector as a result the content of portland cement can be reduced in many cases other recycled raw materials can also contribute to a more economic or less environmental polluting concrete composition 1 usage of residual products from the concrete industry for example stone dust from crushing aggregates concrete slurry from washing mixers or concrete waste 2 usage of residual products from other industries for example fly ash from coal plants and slags from the metallurgical industry 3 usage of new types of cement with reduced environmental impact

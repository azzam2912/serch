there is some debate as to whether it is a discrete compound or simply one phase in an interstitial oxide system tbo is one of the main commercial terbium compounds and the only such product containing at least some tb iv terbium in the 4 oxidation state along with the more stable tb iii it is produced by heating the metal oxalate and it is used in the preparation of other terbium compounds terbium forms three other major oxides tbo tbo and tbo tbo is most often produced by ignition of the oxalate at or the sulfate in air the oxalate at 1000 c is generally preferred since the sulfate requires a higher temperature and it produces an almost black product contaminated with tbo or other oxygen rich oxides terbium iii iv oxide loses o when heated at high temperatures at more moderate temperatures ca 350 c it reversibly loses oxygen as shown by exchange witho this property also seen in pro and vo allows it to work like vo as a redox catalyst in reactions involving oxygen it was found as early as 1916 that hot tbo catalyses the reaction of coal gas co h with air leading to

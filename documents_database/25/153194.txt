in other words there exists some formula 1 such that for all v in x the smallest such m is called the operator norm formula 3 of l a bounded linear operator is generally not a bounded function as generally one can find a sequence formula 4 in x such that formula 5 instead all that is required for the operator to be bounded is that so the operator l could only be a bounded function if it satisfied l v 0 for all v as is easy to understand by considering that for a linear operator formula 7 for all scalars a rather a bounded linear operator is a locally bounded function a linear operator between normed spaces is bounded if and only if it is continuous and by linearity if and only if it is continuous at zero as stated in the introduction a linear operator l between normed spaces x and y is bounded if and only if it is a continuous linear operator the proof is as follows not every linear operator between normed spaces is bounded let x be the space of all trigonometric polynomials defined on with the norm define the operator l x

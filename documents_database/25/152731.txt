the radius of the planet s orbit is 7 million kilometres about 0 047 astronomical units or one eighth the radius of mercury s orbit this small radius results in a year that is 3 5 earth days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1 000 c about 1 800 f its mass is 220 times that of earth 0 69 jupiter masses and its volume is some 2 5 times greater than that of jupiter the high mass and volume of hd 209458 b indicate that it is a gas giant hd 209458 b represents a number of milestones in extraplanetary research it was the first of many categories based on the application of new theoretical models as of april 2007 it is thought to be the first extrasolar planet found to have water vapor in its atmosphere in july 2014 nasa announced finding very dry atmospheres on hd 209458 b and two other exoplanets hd 189733 b and wasp 12b orbiting sun like stars spectroscopic studies first revealed the presence of a planet around hd 209458 on november 5 1999 astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets in

it has also been characterized as a measure of the space filling capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently from the space it is embedded in a fractal dimension does not have to be an integer the essential idea of fractured dimensions has a long history in mathematics but the term itself was brought to the fore by benoit mandelbrot based on his 1967 paper on self similarity in which he discussed fractional dimensions in that paper mandelbrot cited previous work by lewis fry richardson describing the counter intuitive notion that a coastline s measured length changes with the length of the measuring stick used see fig 1 in terms of that notion the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick there are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale ultimately the term fractal dimension became the phrase with which mandelbrot himself became most comfortable with respect to encapsulating the meaning of the word fractal a term he created after several iterations over

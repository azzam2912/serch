each division s product line grew from a different concept for how to optimize a computer s instruction set for particular programming languages the burroughs large systems group designed large mainframes using stack machine instruction sets with dense syllables and 48 bit data words the first such design is the b5000 in 1961 it is optimized for running algol 60 extremely well using simple compilers it evolved into the b5500 subsequent major redesigns include the b6500 b6700 line and its successors and the separate b8500 line burroughs large systems referred to all of these product lines together in contrast to the cobol optimized medium systems b2000 b3000 b4000 or the flexible architecture small systems b1000 founded in the 1880s burroughs was the oldest continuously operating entity in computing but by the late 1950s its computing equipment was still limited to electromechanical accounting machines such as the sensimatic as such it had nothing to compete with its traditional rivals ibm and ncr who had started to produce larger scale computers or with recently founded univac while in 1956 it branded as the b205 a machine produced by a company it bought its first internally developed machine the b5000 was designed in

like the band s 1994 release 1985 this album is viewed more as an archival release than a new album since it features mostly previously recorded material for example the tracks let it go and kitty were initially b sides to the u k edition of the strength single mother s eyes while the song happy holiday was first intended for the 1992 film home alone 2 many of the remaining tracks on peach fuzz were recorded during the making of the 1993 album animals with human intelligence but were likely excluded from that release due to their poppier sounding nature at the time of release the album was largely ignored in the band s concert set lists with the exception of vacant love in more recent years the song kitty has also been performed although no singles were released from the album happy holiday has turned into one of the band s more popular songs due to its inclusion in christmas themed cd s such as monster ballads xmas and we wish you a hairy christmas peach fuzz was initially released in japan with a slightly different track order and a bonus track it was later re issued in

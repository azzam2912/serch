there are weaker signals such as those from microphones mic level microphone level and instrument pickups instrument level and stronger signals such as those used to drive headphones and loudspeakers speaker level the strength of these various signals does not necessarily refer to the output voltage of the source device it also depends on its output impedance and output power capability consumer electronic devices concerned with audio for example sound cards often have a connector labeled line in and or line out line out provides an audio signal output and line in receives a signal input the line in out connections on consumer oriented audio equipment are typically unbalanced with a 0 14 inch but commonly called eighth inch 3 conductor trs minijack connector providing ground left channel and right channel or stereo rca jacks professional equipment commonly uses balanced connections on 1 4 inch trs phone jacks or xlr connectors professional equipment may also use unbalanced connections with 1 4 inch ts phone jacks a line level describes a line s nominal signal level as a ratio expressed in decibels against a standard reference voltage the nominal level and the reference voltage against which it is expressed depend on

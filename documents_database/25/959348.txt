it was produced by hellmuth walter kommanditgesellschaft hwk commencing in 1943 with license production by the heinkel firm s facilities in jenbach austria early versions of the me 163 had been powered by an earlier design running on a cold engine fueled with z stoff this fuel tended to clog the jets in the combustion chamber causing fluctuations in power and potentially explosions worse however was the fact that the engine could not be throttled and when the aircraft leveled off after its climb to altitude it quickly accelerated to speeds that caused serious compressibility issues the rlm demanded that a version be developed with a throttle during this period walter has also been working with a new fuel known as c stoff that gave off significant heat and was thus known as the hot engine c stoff was a mix of 30 hydrazine hydrate 57 methanol 13 water with a small amount of potassium copper cyanide the oxidizer known as t stoff consisted of an 80 concentration hydrogen peroxide based formulation the two reacted violently on contact the violent combustion process resulted in the formation of water carbon dioxide and nitrogen and a huge amount of heat sending out

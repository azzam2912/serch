in the context of life science research dialysis tubing is typically used in the sample clean up and processing of proteins and dna samples or complex biological samples such as blood or serums dialysis tubing is also frequently used as a teaching aid to demonstrate the principles of diffusion osmosis brownian motion and the movement of molecules across a restrictive membrane for the principles and usage of dialysis in a research setting see dialysis biochemistry dialysis occurs throughout nature and the principles of dialysis have been exploited by humans for thousands of years using natural animal or plant based membranes the term dialysis was first routinely used for scientific or medical purposes in the late 1800s and early 1900s pioneered by the work of thomas graham the first mass produced man made membranes suitable for dialysis were not available until the 1930s based on materials used in the food packaging industry such as cellophane in the 1940s willem kolff constructed the first dialyzer artificial kidney and successfully treated patients with renal failure using dialysis across semi permeable membranes today dialysis tubing for laboratory applications comes in a variety of dimensions and molecular weight cutoffs mwco in addition to tubing dialysis

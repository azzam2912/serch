the smt4 and smt8 cores are similar in that they consist of a number of so called slices fed by common schedulers a slice is a rudimentary 64 bit single threaded processing core with load store unit lsu integer unit alu and a vector scalar unit vsu doing simd and floating point a super slice is the combination of two slices an smt4 core consists of a 32 kb l1 cache a 32 kb l1 data cache an instruction fetch unit ifu and an instruction sequencing unit isu which feeds two super slices an smt8 core has two sets of l1 caches and ifus and isus to feed four super slices the result is that the 12 core and 24 core versions of power9 each consist of the same number of slices 96 each and the same amount of l1 cache a power9 core whether smt4 or smt8 has a 12 stage pipeline five stages shorter than its predecessor the power8 but aims to retain the clock frequency of around 4 ghz it will be the first to incorporate elements of the power isa v 3 0 that was released in december 2015 including the vsx 3 instructions the power9

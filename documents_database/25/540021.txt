it is the most common form in which rhenium is traded it is a white water soluble salt it was first described soon after the discovery of rhenium the crystal structure of apr is that of scheelite in which the atomic cation is replaced by the ammonium molecular cation it undergoes a molecular orientational ordering transition on cooling without change of space group but with a highly anisotropic change in the shape of the unit cell resulting in the unusual property of having a positive temperature and pressure re nqr coefficient nhreo can be regarded as the prototype structure of a family of ammonium scheelites which include the pertechnetate nhtco periodate nhio tetrachlorothallate nhtlcl and tetrachloroindate nhincl ammonium perrhenate may be prepared from virtually all common sources of rhenium the metal oxides and sulfides can be oxidized with nitric acid and the resulting solution treated with aqueous ammonia alternatively an aqueous solution of reo can be treated with ammonia followed by crystallisation pure rhenium powder can be produced from apr by heating it in the presence of hydrogen heating must be done slowly because ammonium perrhenate decomposes to volatile reo starting at 250 c when heated in a sealed tube

it has been highly studied in the budding yeast s cerevisiae and the fission yeast s pombe where it is encoded by genes cdc28 and cdc2 respectively in humans cdk1 is encoded by the cdc2 gene with its cyclin partners cdk1 forms complexes that phosphorylate a variety of target substrates over 75 have been identified in budding yeast phosphorylation of these proteins leads to cell cycle progression cdk1 is a small protein approximately 34 kilodaltons and is highly conserved the human homolog of cdk1 cdc2 shares approximately 63 amino acid identity with its yeast homolog furthermore human cdc2 is capable of rescuing fission yeast carrying a cdc2 mutation cdk1 is comprised mostly by the bare protein kinase motif which other protein kinases share cdk1 like other kinases contains a cleft in which atp fits substrates of cdk1 bind near the mouth of the cleft and cdk1 residues catalyze the covalent bonding of the phosphate to the oxygen of the hydroxyl serine threonine of the substrate in addition to this catalytic core cdk1 like other cyclin dependent kinases contains a t loop which in the absence of an interacting cyclin prevents substrate binding to the cdk1 active site cdk1 also contains

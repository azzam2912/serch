the aim is to determine the flow rates and pressure drops in the individual sections of the network this is a common problem in hydraulic design to direct water to many users municipal water supplies often route it through a water supply network a major part of this network will consist of interconnected pipes this network creates a special class of problems in hydraulic design with solution methods typically referred to as pipe network analysis water utilities generally make use of specialized software to automatically solve these problems however many such problems can also be addressed with simpler methods like a spreadsheet equipped with a solver or a modern graphing calculator once the friction factors of the pipes are obtained or calculated from pipe friction laws such as the darcy weisbach equation we can consider how to calculate the flow rates and head losses on the network generally the head losses potential differences at each node are neglected and a solution is sought for the steady state flows on the network taking into account the pipe specifications lengths and diameters pipe friction properties and known flow rates or head losses the steady state flows on the network must satisfy two

this subdivision into 2 classes rln and insl is based primarily on early findings and does not reflect the evolutionary origins or physiological differences between peptides for example it is known that the genes coding for rln3 and insl5 arose from one ancestral gene and insl3 shares origin with rln2 and its multiple duplicates e g rln1 insl4 insl6 in humans and many other tetrapods the rln insl encoding genes exist in 4 distinct clusters the largest cluster contains 4 loci rln1 rln2 insl4 and insl6 situated in tandem on human chromosome 9 chromosome 9 this cluster arose from multiple local gene duplications that took place in the ancestor of placental mammals the other three rln insl genes exist as single loci in two linkage groups rln3 chromosome 19 insl3 chromosome 19 3 8 mb apart from rln3 and insl5 chromosome 1 the physiological action of rln and its tandem duplicates rln1 insl4 insl6 and insl3 has been quite well studied in human and mouse they are primarily associated with reproductive functions such as the relaxation of uterine musculature and of the pubic symphysis during labor rln1 rln2 the progression of spermatogenesis insl6 and possibly trophoblast development insl4 and testicular

more precisely if a is a finite set of generators for g then the word problem is the membership problem for the formal language of all words in a and a formal set of inverses that map to the identity under the natural map from the free monoid with involution on a to the group g if b is another finite generating set for g then the word problem over the generating set b is equivalent to the word problem over the generating set a thus one can speak unambiguously of the decidability of the word problem for the finitely generated group g the related but different uniform word problem for a class k of recursively presented groups is the algorithmic problem of deciding given as input a presentation p for a group g in the class k and two words in the generators of g whether the words represent the same element of g some authors require the class k to be definable by a recursively enumerable set of presentations throughout the history of the subject computations in groups have been carried out using various normal forms these usually implicitly solve the word problem for the groups in question

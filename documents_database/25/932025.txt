it is usually considered myeloid specific but it can also be found on some lymphoid cells it binds sialic acids therefore is a member of the siglec family of lectins the extracellular portion of this receptor contains two immunoglobulin domains one igv and one igc2 domain placing cd33 within the immunoglobulin superfamily the intracellular portion of cd33 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs itims that are implicated in inhibition of cellular activity cd33 can be stimulated by any molecule with sialic acid residues such as glycoproteins or glycolipids upon binding the immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif itim of cd33 present on the cytosolic portion of the protein is phosphorylated and acts as a docking site for src homology 2 sh2 domain containing proteins like shp phosphatases this results in a cascade that inhibits phagocytosis in the cell cd33 is the target of gemtuzumab ozogamicin trade name mylotarg pfizer wyeth ayerst laboratories an antibody drug conjugate for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia the drug is a recombinant humanized anti cd33 monoclonal antibody igg4 antibody hp67 6 covalently attached to the cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin n acetyl calicheamicin via a bifunctional linker 4 4 acetylphenoxy butanoic acid on september

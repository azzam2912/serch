low poly meshes occur in real time applications e g games as contrast with high poly meshes in animated movies and special effects of the same era the term low poly is used in both a technical and a descriptive sense the number of polygons in a mesh is an important factor to optimize for performance but can give an undesirable appearance to the resulting graphics polygon meshes are one of the major methods of modelling a 3d object for display by a computer polygons can in theory have any number of sides but are commonly broken down into triangles for display in general the more triangles in a mesh the more detailed the object is but the more computationally intensive it is to display in order to decrease render times i e increase frame rate the number of triangles in the scene must be reduced by using low poly meshes computer graphics techniques such as normal and bump mapping have been designed to compensate for the decrease of polygons by making a low poly object appear to contain more detail than it does this is done by altering the shading of polygons to contain internal detail which is not

as direct entangling operations with photons often require nonlinear effects probabilistic generation of entangled resource states has been proposed as an alternative path to the direct approach on a silicon photonic chip one of the most common platforms for implementing loqc there are two typical choices for encoding quantum information though many more options exist photons have useful degrees of freedom in the spatial modes of the possible photon paths or in the polarization of the photons themselves the way in which a cluster state is generated varies with which encoding has been chosen for implementation storing information in the spatial modes of the photon paths is often referred to as dual rail encoding in a simple case one might consider the situation where a photon has two possible paths a horizontal path with creation operator formula 1 and a vertical path with creation operator formula 2 where the logical zero and one states are then represented by and single qubit operations are then performed by beam splitters which allow manipulation of the relative superposition weights of the modes and phase shifters which allow manipulation of the relative phases of the two modes this type of encoding lends itself to

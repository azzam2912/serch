its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial soil including its toxicity due to the presence of perchlorates the term martian soil typically refers to the finer fraction of regolith on earth the term soil usually includes organic content in contrast planetary scientists adopt a functional definition of soil to distinguish it from rocks rocks generally refer to 10 cm scale and larger materials e g fragments breccia and exposed outcrops with high thermal inertia with areal fractions consistent with the viking infrared thermal mapper irtm data and immobile under current aeolian conditions consequently rocks classify as grains exceeding the size of cobbles on the wentworth scale this approach enables agreement across martian remote sensing methods that span the electromagnetic spectrum from gamma to radio waves soil refers to all other typically unconsolidated material including those sufficiently fine grained to be mobilized by wind soil consequently encompasses a variety of regolith components identified at landing sites typical examples include bedform armor clasts concretions drift dust rocky fragments and sand the functional definition reinforces a recently proposed genetic definition of soil on terrestrial bodies including asteroids and satellites as an unconsolidated and chemically weathered surficial layer of fine grained mineral

the cpa1 family belongs to the vic superfamily transporters from eukaryotes have been functionally characterized to catalyze na h exchange their primary physiological functions are thought to be in 1 cytoplasmic ph regulation extruding the h generated during metabolism and 2 salt tolerance in plants due to na uptake into vacuoles bacterial homologues have also been found to facilitate na h antiport but some also catalyze li h antiport or ca h antiport under certain conditions the phylogenetic tree for the cpa1 family shows three principal clusters the first cluster includes proteins derived exclusively from animals and all of the functionally characterized members of the family belong to this cluster of the two remaining clusters one includes all bacterial homologues while the other includes one from arabidopsis thaliana one from homo sapiens and two from yeast s cerevisiae and s pombe several organisms possess multiple paralogues for example seven paralogues are found in c elegans and five are known in humans most of these paralogues are very similar in sequence and they belong to the animal specific cluster a representative list of proteins belonging to the cpa1 family can be found in the transporter classification database numerous members of the

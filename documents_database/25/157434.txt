mixtures of proteins are separated by two properties in two dimensions on 2d gels 2 de was first independently introduced by o farrell and klose in 1975 2 d electrophoresis begins with electrophoresis in the first dimension and then separates the molecules perpendicularly from the first to create an electropherogram in the second dimension in electrophoresis in the first dimension molecules are separated linearly according to their isoelectric point in the second dimension the molecules are then separated at 90 degrees from the first electropherogram according to molecular mass since it is unlikely that two molecules will be similar in two distinct properties molecules are more effectively separated in 2 d electrophoresis than in 1 d electrophoresis the two dimensions that proteins are separated into using this technique can be isoelectric point protein complex mass in the native state or protein mass separation of the proteins by isoelectric point is called isoelectric focusing ief thereby a gradient of ph is applied to a gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel making one end more positive than the other at all ph values other than their isoelectric point proteins will be charged if they are positively charged they

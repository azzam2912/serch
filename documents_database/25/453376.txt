increasing irregularity of this respiratory rate generally is a sign that the patient will enter into coma cnh is unrelated to other forms of hyperventilation like kussmaul s respirations cnh is the human body s response to reduced carbon dioxide levels in the blood this reduction in carbon dioxide is caused by contraction of cranial arteries from damage caused by lesions in the brain stem however the mechanism by which cnh arises as a result from these lesions is still very poorly understood current research has yet to provide an effective means of treatment for the rare number of patients who are diagnosed with this condition symptoms of cnh have been observed to vary according to the progression of cnh the initial symptoms of cnh include a low arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide a high or normal arterial partial pressure of oxygen high arterial ph and tachypnea the partial pressure of carbon dioxide has been noted by yushi et al to drop as low as 6 7 mmhg while oxygen saturation remains at 99 100 respiratory alkalosis is induced in people affected with cnh which stimulates the hyperpnea to attempt to compensate the rise of the blood s ph

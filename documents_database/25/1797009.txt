the emotion fear has been hard wired into almost every individual due to its vital role in the survival of the individual researchers have found that fear is established unconsciously and that the amygdala is involved with fear conditioning by understanding how fear is developed within individuals it may be possible to treat human mental disorders such as anxiety phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder in fear conditioning the main circuits that are involved are the sensory areas that process the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli certain regions of the amygdala that undergo plasticity or long term potentiation during learning and the regions that bear an effect on the expression of specific conditioned responses these pathways converge in the lateral amygdala long term potentiation ltp and synaptic plasticity that enhances the response of lateral amygdala neurons to the conditioned stimulus occurs in the lateral amygdala as a result the conditioned stimulus is then able to flow from the lateral amygdala to the central nucleus of the amygdala the basal and intercalated masses of the amygdala connect the lateral amygdala with the central nucleus of the amygdala directly and indirectly pathways from central nucleus of the amygdala to downstream areas then control defensive

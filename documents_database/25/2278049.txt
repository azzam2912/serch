tolman is an inorganic chemist whose laboratory works on synthesis and characterization of bioinorganic systems organometallic reagents and polymers he received his bachelor s degree in chemistry from wesleyan university in 1983 and then completed a ph d program in chemistry at the university of california berkeley by 1987 under the guidance of professor k peter c vollhardt he is currently employed at the university of minnesota as the department chair of chemistry in addition to his faculty position he is also the editor and chief of the acs journal of inorganic chemistry tolman s work in the bioinorganic field focuses on cu o adducts specifically copper proteins whose diverse biological functions include o transport aromatic ring oxidations biogenesis of hormones his work studies the potential of 1 1 cu o adducts as catalytic species which have been known as transient intermediates for more commonly studied 2 1 and even 3 1 cu o molecules these complexes while kinetically favored in formation are thermodynamically unstable due to negative entropy values thus making them more difficult to isolate although increasing ligand sizes on these 1 1 adducts did correlate with slower reaction rate constants advantageous for isolating and studying these complexes

when the corresponding test fixture class is run concordion interprets the instrumentation to execute the test rather than forcing product owners to specify requirements in a specially structured language concordion lets you write them in normal language using paragraphs tables and proper punctuation this makes the specifications much more natural to read and write and helps everyone to understand and agree about what a feature is supposed to do the markdown html or excel files are typically stored with the source code which has the benefit that they can be under the same version control system as the rest of the code ensuring the specification and tests are branched and merged along with the main source code concordion includes a flexible extension mechanism for adding functionality for example implementing new commands listening to events or modifying the output documentation by providing functionality such as embedding screenshots storyboards or logging output extensions provide confidence in what the test is doing without locking the test into a specific implementation concordion enriches agile processes and has been successfully applied in industrial context the concordion support plugin for the intellij idea integrated development environment ide simplifies development of fixtures and specifications with features including

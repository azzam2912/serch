when a certain area of earth s crust reaches the state of isostasy it is said to be in isostatic equilibrium isostasy does not upset equilibrium but instead restores it a negative feedback it is generally accepted that earth is a dynamic system that responds to loads in many different ways however isostasy provides an important view of the processes that are happening in areas that are experiencing vertical movement certain areas such as the himalayas are not in isostatic equilibrium which has forced researchers to identify other reasons to explain their topographic heights in the case of the himalayas which are still rising by proposing that their elevation is being supported by the force of the impacting indian plate the basin and range province of the western us is another example of a region not in isostatic equilibrium although originally defined in terms of continental crust and mantle it has subsequently been interpreted in terms of lithosphere and asthenosphere particularly with respect to oceanic island volcanoes such as the hawaiian islands in the simplest example isostasy is the principle of buoyancy wherein an object immersed in a fluid is buoyed with a force equal to the weight of the

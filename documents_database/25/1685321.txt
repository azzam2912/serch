the jacquet functor is the functor that sends a linear representation to its jacquet module the jacquet module j v of a representation v of a group n is the space of co invariants of n or in other words the largest quotient of v on which n acts trivially or the zeroth homology group h n v in other words it is the quotient v v where v is the subspace of v generated by elements of the form n v v for all n in n and all v in v the jacquet functor j is the functor taking v to its jacquet module j v jacquet modules are used to classify admissible irreducible representations of a reductive algebraic group g over a local field and n is the unipotent radical of a parabolic subgroup of g in the case of p adic groups they were studied by for the general linear group gl 2 the jacquet module of an admissible irreducible representation has dimension at most two if the dimension is zero then the representation is called a supercuspidal representation if the dimension is one then the representation is a special representation if the dimension is two

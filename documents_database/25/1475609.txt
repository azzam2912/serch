it was long considered to be a liverwort which it strongly resembles but in 2009 a molecular phylogenetic study determined that it is in fact a fern gametophyte further it is a species of lomariopsis it is closest to lomariopsis lineata but may be a new unnamed species many reference sources on the web describe it as l lineata but its inclusion in that species has not been validly determined efforts to induce the plant to form a sporophyte have failed which may indicate status as a new species this plant was first mis identified as pellia endiviifolia before the analysis that determined its true status the name s sswassertang means freshwater seaweed in german it is commonly incorrectly spelled subwassertang due to the german eszett s similarity to the latin b it was formerly known as round pellia or round leaf pellia reproduction is by fragmentation pieces that break off develop into new plants the plant is thalloid in form and exhibits indeterminate growth it is profusely branched and 1 cell layer thick because of its lack of morphological characters it has been difficult to determine its systematic position gametangia are rarely produced but they are clearly fern like

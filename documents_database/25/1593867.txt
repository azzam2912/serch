they include two relatively large genera melica based on accounts in multiple regional floras with about 80 90 species and glyceria with about 55 species its other genera are koordersiochloa lycochloa pleuropogon schizachne and triniochloa members of the meliceae have closed leaf sheaths lemma veins that do not or only scarcely converge distally and short truncate lodicules they differ from bromeae another tribe with closed leaf sheaths in their glabrous ovaries as well as their lemma venation and short short lodicules they also differ from other members of the pooideae in having chromosome base numbers of 9 10 and 8 the meliceae are most abundant in temperate regions of eurasia but are also well represented in temperate regions of north and south america but there are great differences between the genera glyceria and pleuropogon grow in wet areas often in standing water melica and schizachne tend to grow in dry well drained sites members of the meliceae have little economic importance a few species of both melica and glyceria are grown as ornamentals more merit consideration but caution should be used some species of glyceria notably g declinata are invasive

this technique first gained attention in the 1960s based on the work of ladislaus von rabcewicz leopold m ller and franz pacher between 1957 and 1965 in austria the name natm was intended to distinguish it from the old austrian tunnelling approach the fundamental difference between this new method of tunneling as opposed to earlier methods comes from the economic advantages made available by taking advantage of the inherent geological strength available in the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel natm sem is generally thought to have helped revolutionise the modern tunneling industry many modern tunnels have used this excavation technique the works built by the sequential excavation method are very attractive from the economic point of view and reasonable in karst conditions the natm integrates the principles of the behaviour of rock masses under load and monitoring the performance of underground construction during construction the natm has often been referred to as a design as you go approach by providing an optimized support based on observed ground conditions more correctly it can be described as a design as you monitor approach based on observed convergence and divergence in the lining and mapping of prevailing rock conditions it is

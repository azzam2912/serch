it is used in intel core microarchitecture and netburst microarchitecture dempsey based dp capable server processors the dual core xeon is codenamed dempsey woodcrest and wolfdale and the quad core processors clovertown harpertown and yorkfield cl it is also used for the core 2 extreme qx9775 it was succeeded by lga 1366 for the nehalem based xeon processors as its name implies it is a land grid array with 771 contacts the word socket in this instance is a misnomer as the processor interface has no pin holes instead it has 771 protruding lands which touch contact points on the underside of the microprocessor the j in socket j refers to the now canceled processor codenamed jayhawk which was expected to debut alongside this interface it is intended as a successor to socket 604 and takes much of its design from lga 775 and is almost pin compatible with lga 775 socket 771 cpus are rotated 90 degrees and have two pins swapped small adapters developed by chinese computer diy enthusiasts are available to allow lga 771 cpus to be installed in lga 775 motherboards if the bios microcode supports them but it is also able to add supportion microcode

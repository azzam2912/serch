in overview it is quite similar to pos and dtm it was one of the major influences on the resilient packet ring 802 17 standard dpt is implemented as two counter rotating rings this means the network is composed of two completely separate rings of fiber that are both able to transmit data concurrently this design provides for redundancy in case of a fiber cut or link failure and increased throughput in common situations dpt as opposed to pos or normal sonet sdh is able to use both rings at the same time whereas pos only uses one ring under normal circumstances but switches to the second upon failure of the first cisco claims that dpt can run with double the bit rate of pos due to this characteristic dpt is not a ppp whereas pos is this means that traffic between two nodes of a dpt ring does not affect intermediate nodes with the introduction of dpt came the introduction of another cisco developed mac layer protocol spatial reuse protocol or srp the use of srp in conjunction with dpt makes it possible for dpt to communicate with the physical layer as with most other lower layer protocols there

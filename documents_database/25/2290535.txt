the input of the circuit is connected to an analog video source the output triggers an oscilloscope so display the selected line on the oscilloscope or similar device video line selectors are circuits or units of other devices fitted to the demand of the unit or a separate device for use in workshops production and laboratories they contain analog and digital circuits and an internal or external dc power supply there s a video signal input sometimes an output to prevent reflexions of the video signal and the cause of shadows of the video picture also a trigger output there is also an input or adjust for the line number s to be picked out and as an option an automatic or manual setting to fit other video standards and non interlaced video video line selectors do not need all the picture signal just the synchronisation signals are needed sometimes inputs for h and v sync were installed only the video signal input is 75 terminated or connected to the video output for a monitor the amplified video signal is connected to the inputs of the h und v sync detector circuits the h sync detector outputs the horizontal synchronisation

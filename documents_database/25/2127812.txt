the reaction is named for e j corey and john link who first reported the reaction sequence the first stage of the process is the reduction of the carbonyl to give a 1 1 1 tricholoro 2 hydroxy structure the original protocol used catecholborane with a small amount of one enantiomer of cbs catalyst a corey itsuno reduction the choice of chirality of the catalyst thus gives selectivity for one or the other stereochemistry of the alcohol in the product this 2 hydroxy structure is then reacted with azide and a nucleophilic base the multistep reaction mechanism begins with deprotonation of the alcohol followed by the oxygen anion attacking the adjacent trichloromethyl position to form an epoxide the azide then opens this ring by an s2 reaction to give a 2 azido structure whose stereochemistry is inverted compared to the original 2 hydroxy the oxygen having become attached to the first carbon of the chain during the epoxide formation simultaneously displaces a second chlorine atom there to form an acyl chloride an additional nucleophilic reactant such as hydroxide or an alkoxide then triggers an acyl substitution there to produce a carboxylic acid or ester various other nucleophiles can be used

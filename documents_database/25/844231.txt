in simpler terms music that consists of separately formed particles however complexly these may be composed is called punctual music as opposed to linear or group formed or mass formed music bolding in the source this was accomplished by assigning to each note in a composition values drawn from scales of pitch duration dynamics and attack characteristics resulting in a stronger individualizing of separate tones another important factor was maintaining discrete values in all parameters of the music punctual dynamics for example mean that all dynamic degrees are fixed one point will be linked directly to another on the chosen scale without any intervening transition or gesture line dynamics on the other hand involve the transitions from one given amplitude to another crescendo decrescendo and their combinations this second category can be defined as a dynamic glissando comparable to glissandi of pitch and of tempi accelerando ritardando the almost analytical focus on individual events and then the transition between them brings a stillness to this music far removed from the gestural quality of other pieces from a purely technical point of view the term punctual has the sense of a point of intersection of parameters in serial music retrospectively attributed

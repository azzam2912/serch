if a current of 1 ampere flowing through the coil produces flux linkage of 1 weber turn the coil has a self inductance of 1 henry the unit is named after joseph henry 1797 1878 the american scientist who discovered electromagnetic induction independently of and at about the same time as michael faraday 1791 1867 in england the inductance of an electric circuit is one henry when an electric current that is changing at one ampere per second results in an electromotive force of one volt across the inductor where v t denotes the resulting voltage across the circuit i t is the current through the circuit and l is the inductance of the circuit the henry is a derived unit based on four of the seven base units of the international system of units kilogram kg metre m second s and ampere a expressed in combinations of si units the henry is in which the following additional derived units occur coulomb c farad f joule j weber wb tesla t volt v hertz hz and ohm the international system of units si specifies to write the symbol of a unit named for a person with an initial capital letter

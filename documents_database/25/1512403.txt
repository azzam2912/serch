the genus has a widespread distribution and contains 36 species they are sometimes called kidney lichens named after the characteristic kidney shaped apothecia that they produce on the lower surface of their lobe tips which often curl upwards and thus are visible from above sterile specimens that do not have apothecia can look somewhat like melanelia peltigera platismatia or asahinea most species grow either on mossy ground or rocks or on trees all species of nephroma contain cyanobacteria in the genus nostoc as a photobiont which allows the organism to fix nitrogen in some species the cyanobacteria is the sole photobiont while other species also contain a green alga photobiont coccomyxa and the cyanobacteria is restricted to warty cephalodia on the upper or lower surface of the lichen species of nephroma have a stratified foliose thallus with a cortex that is well developed on both the upper and lower surfaces the fruit bodies apothecia are formed on the lower surface of the thallus which is later curved backward to expose the hymenium spore bearing surface initially the ascomata are immersed with a vegetative covering that splits open at later stages of development in contrast to all other groups of peltigerales

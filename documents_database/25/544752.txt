whereas irrigation is the practice of providing additional water to soil when it is naturally too dry drainage reduces the moisture in soil and thereby increases the amount of air in its pores so as to augment conditions for optimal growth of crops while surface water can be drained by pumping open ditches or both tile drainage is often the most prudent practice for draining subsurface water the phrase tile drainage derives from its original composition from tiles of fired clay i e ceramic which were similar to terracotta pipes yet not always shaped as are pipes in the 19th century a c shaped channel tile commonly was placed like an arch atop a flat tile denominated the mug and sole respectively today tile drainage is any variation of this original system that functions in the same mode commonly hdpe and pvc tubing denominated tile line is used although precast concrete and ceramic tiles are still used excess subsurface water is counterproductive to agriculture because it fills the pores of the soil and evacuates the air they contain roots of plants require a quantum of air to live and grow and therefore excess subsurface water inhibits their growth and if

reasons to use multiple kernel learning include a the ability to select for an optimal kernel and parameters from a larger set of kernels reducing bias due to kernel selection while allowing for more automated machine learning methods and b combining data from different sources e g sound and images from a video that have different notions of similarity and thus require different kernels instead of creating a new kernel multiple kernel algorithms can be used to combine kernels already established for each individual data source multiple kernel learning approaches have been used in many applications such as event recognition in video object recognition in images and biomedical data fusion multiple kernel learning algorithms have been developed for supervised semi supervised as well as unsupervised learning most work has been done on the supervised learning case with linear combinations of kernels however many algorithms have been developed the basic idea behind multiple kernel learning algorithms is to add an extra parameter to the minimization problem of the learning algorithm as an example consider the case of supervised learning of a linear combination of a set of formula 1 kernels formula 2 we introduce a new kernel formula 3 where formula

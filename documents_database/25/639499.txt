the sx 8 series implements an eight way smp system in a compact node module and uses an enhanced version of the single chip vector processor that was introduced with the sx 6 the nec sx 8 processors run at 2 ghz for vectors and 1 ghz for scalar operations the sx 8 cpu operates at 16 gflops and can address up to 128 gb of memory up to 8 cpus may be used in a single node and a complete system may have up to 512 nodes the sx 8 series ranges from the single cpu sx 8b system to the sx 8 4096m512 with 512 nodes 4 096 cpus and a peak performance of 65 tflops there is up to 512 gb s bandwidth per node 64 gb s per processor the sx 8 runs super ux a unix like operating system developed by nec the first production sx 8 was installed at the uk met office in early 2005 in october 2006 an upgraded sx 8 was announced the sx 8r the nec sx 8r processors run at 2 2 ghz for vectors and 1 1 ghz for scalar operations the sx 8r can process double the

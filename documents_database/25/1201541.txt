it was introduced in 1992 for system 7 and has been updated to run on macos its name comes from its use of the zmodem file transfer protocol which zterm implemented in a particularly high performance package in contrast to the built in os x terminal app which only communicates with other programs zterm only communicates with hardware serial ports when it was first introduced in 1992 zterm was one of the highest performing terminal emulators on the mac both in terms of basic text display as well as file transfer performance zterm was widely regarded as the best terminal program on the mac its hardware support included carrier detect cd hardware hangup dtr and hardware flow control as well as speeds up to 119 200 bit s on those machines that supported it these features were not universally supported in mac hardware so many terminal emulators simply ignored them even if these speeds were offered most emulators of the era were so slow that they had trouble keeping up with faster modems especially 9600 bit s and faster zterm supported one of the widest variety of file transfer protocols available on the mac including a full implementation of zmodem

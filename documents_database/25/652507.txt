as the name qvt indicates the omg standard covers transformations views and queries together model queries and model views can be seen as special kinds of model transformation provided that we use a suitably broad definition of model transformation a model transformation is a program which operates on models the qvt standard defines three model transformation languages all of them operate on models which conform to meta object facility mof 2 0 metamodels the transformation states which metamodels are used a transformation in any of the three qvt languages can itself be regarded as a model conforming to one of the metamodels specified in the standard the qvt standard integrates the ocl 2 0 standard and also extends it with imperative features finally qvt blackbox is a mechanism to invoke transformation facilities expressed in other languages for example xslt or xquery although qvt has a broad scope it does not cover everything that has been considered as a model transformation view or query for example the qvt languages do not permit transformations to or from textual models since each model must conform to some mof 2 0 metamodel model to text transformations are being standardised separately by omg see mofm2t

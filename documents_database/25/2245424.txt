in 1972 symptoms begin in infancy and include the inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive several genes have been associated with the disorder including slc12a6 autopsy examination of 8 cases has shown both developmental and degenerative neuropathologic features in this disease consistent with clinical duality as both a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder in the central nervous system accompanying the hypotonia at birth is hypoplasia of the corticospinal tracts another developmental feature is seen in the corpus callosum which varies from absent to hypoplastic the anterior commissure is almost always absent but occasionally hypoplastic a bundle of probst can be found running antero posterior rather than crossing the midline the axonal damage due to the channel deficiency can cause a reactive axonal overgrowth leading to small tumor like growths or tumorlets called axonomas or balls of aberrant axons damaged axons can also show a sign of inhibition of axonal transport forming axonal spheroids these spheroids can be throughout the cerebral hemispheres explaining the psychotic symptoms by disconnection of the brain from itself by axonal functional disruption in the peripheral nervous system the disease is more severe while most nervous system diseases affect either cns or pns this disease affects both but it

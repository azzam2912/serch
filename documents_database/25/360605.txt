it is a stronger restriction than that of a highly composite number which is defined as having more divisors than any smaller positive integer the first 10 superior highly composite numbers and their factorization are listed for a superior highly composite number n there exists a positive real number such that for all natural numbers k smaller than n we have and for all natural numbers k larger than n we have where d n the divisor function denotes the number of divisors of n the term was coined by ramanujan 1915 the first 15 superior highly composite numbers 2 6 12 60 120 360 2520 5040 55440 720720 1441440 4324320 21621600 367567200 6983776800 are also the first 15 colossally abundant numbers which meet a similar condition based on the sum of divisors function rather than the number of divisors all superior highly composite numbers are highly composite an effective construction of the set of all superior highly composite numbers is given by the following monotonic mapping from the positive real numbers let for any prime number p and positive real x then note that the product need not be computed indefinitely because if formula 5 then formula 6 so

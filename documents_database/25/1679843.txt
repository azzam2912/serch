these numerical methods are applicable to solid mechanics as well as fluid dynamics problems for simplicity we choose elasticity problems 2nd order pde for our discussion our discussion is also most convenient in reference to the well known weak and strong form in a strong formulation for an approximate solution we need to assume displacement functions that are 2nd order differentiable in a weak formulation we create linear and bilinear forms and then search for a particular function an approximate solution that satisfy the weak statement the bilinear form uses gradient of the functions that has only 1st order differentiation therefore the requirement on the continuity of assumed displacement functions is weaker than in the strong formulation in a discrete form such as the finite element method or fem a sufficient requirement for an assumed displacement function is piecewise continuous over the entire problems domain this allows us to construct the function using elements but making sure it is continuous a long all element interfaces leading to the powerful fem now in a weakened weak w2 formulation we further reduce the requirement we form a bilinear form using only the assumed function not even the gradient this is done by

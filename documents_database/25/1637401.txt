commonly monitored avionics buses include typically a bus monitor must listen only on the bus and intercept a copy of the messages on the bus in general a bus monitor never transmits on the monitored bus once the bus monitor has intercepted a message the message is made available to the rest of the data acquisition system for subsequent recording and or analysis there are three classes of bus monitor parser bus monitoring is also known as coherent monitoring or irig 106 chapter 4 monitoring parser bus monitors are suited to applications where the bus is highly active and only a few specific parameters of interest must be extracted the parser bus monitor uses protocol tracking to identify and classify messages on the bus from the identified messages of interest specific parameters can be extracted from the captured messages in order to ensure that coherency is achieved whereby all extracted parameters are from the same message instance the parameters must be triple buffered with stale and skipped indicators optionally time tags can be added to each parsed message snarfer bus monitoring is also known as fifo or irig 106 chapter 8 monitoring snarfer bus monitors are suited to applications where

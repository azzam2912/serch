twip steels have mostly high content in mn above 20 in weight and small additions of elements such c work hardening attributed to the partitioning of the austenite grains is the main contributing factor to the overall elongation of twip steels in which the mechanical strain of twinning have a rather small contribution twip steels usually contain large concentrations of mn because it is crucial to preserve the austenitic structure based on the ternary system of fe mn al and control stacking fault energy sfe of the iron based alloys the addition of aluminium to fe high mn twip steels is because it increases sfe significantly and therefore stabilizes the austenite against phase transformations which can occur in the fe mn alloys during deformation furthermore it strengthens the austenite by solid solution hardening austenitic steels are used widely in many applications because of their excellent strength and ductility combined with good wear and corrosion resistance high mn twip steels are attractive for automotive applications due to their high energy absorption which is more than twice that of conventional high strength steels and high stiffness which can improve the crash safety

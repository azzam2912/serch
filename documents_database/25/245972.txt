the ideal quotient is viewed as a quotient because formula 2 if and only if formula 3 the ideal quotient is useful for calculating primary decompositions it also arises in the description of the set difference in algebraic geometry see below i j is sometimes referred to as a colon ideal because of the notation in the context of fractional ideals there is a related notion of the inverse of a fractional ideal the ideal quotient satisfies the following properties the above properties can be used to calculate the quotient of ideals in a polynomial ring given their generators for example if i f f f and j g g are ideals in k x x then then elimination theory can be used to calculate the intersection of i with g and g calculate a gr bner basis for ti 1 t g with respect to lexicographic order then the basis functions which have no t in them generate formula 16 the ideal quotient corresponds to set difference in algebraic geometry more precisely where formula 18 denotes the taking of the ideal associated to a subset where formula 20 denotes the zariski closure and formula 21 denotes the taking of

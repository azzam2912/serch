the moon lacks a significant atmosphere which eliminates erosion due to weather it does not have any known form of plate tectonics it has a lower gravity and because of its small size it cooled more rapidly the complex geomorphology of the lunar surface has been formed by a combination of processes especially impact cratering and volcanism the moon is a differentiated body with a crust mantle and core geological studies of the moon are based on a combination of earth based telescope observations measurements from orbiting spacecraft lunar samples and geophysical data six locations were sampled directly during the crewed apollo program landings from 1969 to 1972 which returned of lunar rock and lunar soil to earth in addition three robotic soviet luna spacecraft returned another from 1970 to 1976 the moon is the only extraterrestrial body for which we have samples with a known geologic context a handful of lunar meteorites have been recognized on earth though their source craters on the moon are unknown a substantial portion of the lunar surface has not been explored and a number of geological questions remain unanswered elements known to be present on the lunar surface include among others oxygen o

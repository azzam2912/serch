its name refers to the engineers demand that a normal working day should consist of no more than nine hours the strike began in august 1871 when the engineers in newcastle upon tyne gateshead and adjoining areas of tyneside formally requested that their masters employers place limits on working hours this request was rejected and a strike ensued it was particularly bitter and made more so when the masters refused to talk to the employees only to legal advisors and then brought in foreign workers from abroad including many from belgium and germany in an attempt to break the strike attempts were made by the strikers to persuade these foreign workers to return home some but very few involved violence it was not long before the vast majority of the foreigners realised that they were being used were reinforcing the system described by some as industrial slavery and would lose their jobs anyway once the strike was resolved many agreed to leave provided that their return fare would be paid the money was quickly raised for this purpose by donations from all parts of industry including from many far of places within great britain many attempts to mediate were made

1 in some animals they remain as separate bones called orbitosphenoids the main features of the lesser wing are the optic canal the anterior clinoid process and the superior orbital fissure the superior surface of each is flat and supports part of the frontal lobe of the brain the inferior surface forms the back part of the roof of the orbit and the upper boundary of the superior orbital fissure this fissure is of a triangular form and leads from the cavity of the cranium into that of the orbit it is bounded medially by the body above by the small wing below by the medial margin of the orbital surface of the great wing and is completed laterally by the frontal bone it transmits the oculomotor nerve the trochlear nerve and the abducent nerve the three branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic nervous system the orbital branch of the middle meningeal artery a recurrent branch from the lacrimal artery to the dura mater and the ophthalmic vein the anterior border is serrated for articulation with the frontal bone the posterior border smooth and rounded is received into

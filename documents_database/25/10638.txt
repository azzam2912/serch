the term was coined after mysterious anecdotal stories involving austrian theoretical physicist wolfgang pauli describing numerous instances in which demonstrations involving equipment suffered technical problems only when he was present the pauli effect is not related with the pauli exclusion principle which is a bona fide physical phenomenon named after pauli however the pauli effect was humorously tagged as a second pauli exclusion principle according to which a functioning device and wolfgang pauli may not occupy the same room pauli himself was convinced that the effect named after him was real pauli corresponded with hans bender and carl jung and saw the effect as an example of the concept of synchronicity since the 20th century the work of physics research has been divided between theorists and experimentalists see scientific method only a few physicists such as enrico fermi have been successful in both roles lacking an aptitude or interest in experimental work many theorists have earned a reputation for accidentally breaking experimental equipment pauli was exceptional in this regard it was postulated that he was such a good theorist that any experiments would be compromised by virtue of his presence in the vicinity for fear of the pauli effect the

in that paper three graphical rules based on graph theory were presented for deriving kinetic equations in steady state enzyme catalyzed systems shortly afterwards two more effective graphical rules were proposed in 1985 these graphic rules had been implemented by david myers and graham plamer as microcomputer tools for finding numeric solutions for extremely complicated enzyme kinetics systems using graphical rules to deal with kinetic systems is an elegant approach that combines graph representation and rigorous mathematical derivation it has the following advantages 1 providing an intuitive picture or illuminative insights 2 helping grasp the key points from complicated details 3 greatly simplifying many tedious laborious and error prone calculations and 4 able to double check the final results in 1989 a set of four graphic rules were summarized by kuo chen chou where rules 1 3 are for steady state enzyme catalyzed systems while rule 4 is for non steady state enzyme catalyzed systems subsequently these graphic rules were extended to deal with protein folding kinetics as well these graphical rules can significantly simplify the derivation of enzyme kinetic equations and help mechanism analysis they may be utilized to investigate kinetic mechanisms of drugs inhibiting hiv reverse transcriptase and

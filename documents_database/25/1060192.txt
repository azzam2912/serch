the model posits an internal clock and particular memory and decision processes set is one of the most important models of animal timing behavior john gibbon originally proposed set to explain the temporally controlled behavior of non human subjects he initially used the model to account for a pattern of behavior seen in animals that are being reinforced at fixed intervals for example every 2 minutes an animal that is well trained on such a fixed interval schedule pauses after each reinforcement and then suddenly starts responding about two thirds of the way through the new interval see operant conditioning the model explains how the animal s behavior is controlled by time in this manner gibbon and others later elaborated the model and applied it to a variety of other timing phenomena set assumes that the animal has a clock a working memory a reference memory and a decision process the clock contains a discrete pacemaker that generates pulses like the ticks a mechanical clock a stimulus that signals the start of a timed interval closes a switch allowing pulses to enter an accumulator the resulting accumulation of pulses represents elapsed time and this time value is continuously sent to

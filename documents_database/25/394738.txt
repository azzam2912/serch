it is used in ceramics and glasses though not in a raw form it is the base anhydride of sodium hydroxide so when water is added to sodium oxide naoh is produced the alkali metal oxides mo m li na k rb crystallise in the antifluorite structure in this motif the positions of the anions and cations are reversed relative to their positions in caf with sodium ions tetrahedrally coordinated to 4 oxide ions and oxide cubically coordinated to 8 sodium ions sodium oxide is produced by the reaction of sodium with sodium hydroxide sodium peroxide or sodium nitrite most of these reactions rely on the reduction of something by sodium whether it is hydroxide peroxide or nitrite burning sodium in air will produce nao and about 20 sodium peroxide nao sodium oxide is a significant component of glasses and windows although it is added in the form of soda sodium carbonate sodium oxide does not explicitly exist in glasses since glasses are complex cross linked polymers typically manufactured glass contains around 15 sodium oxide 70 silica silicon dioxide and 9 lime calcium oxide the sodium carbonate soda serves as a flux to lower the temperature at which the silica

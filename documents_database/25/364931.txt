smart antennas should not be confused with reconfigurable antennas which have similar capabilities but are single element antennas and not antenna arrays smart antenna techniques are used notably in acoustic signal processing track and scan radar radio astronomy and radio telescopes and mostly in cellular systems like w cdma umts and lte smart antennas have many functions doa estimation beamforming interference nulling and constant modulus preservation the smart antenna system estimates the direction of arrival of the signal using techniques such as music multiple signal classification estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques esprit algorithms matrix pencil method or one of their derivatives they involve finding a spatial spectrum of the antenna sensor array and calculating the doa from the peaks of this spectrum these calculations are computationally intensive matrix pencil is very efficient in case of real time systems and under the correlated sources beamforming is the method used to create the radiation pattern of the antenna array by adding constructively the phases of the signals in the direction of the targets mobiles desired and nulling the pattern of the targets mobiles that are undesired interfering targets this can be done with a simple finite impulse response fir

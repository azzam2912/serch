it provided beams for cern s first experiments in particle and nuclear physics where the accelerated particles could reach energies up to the foundation stone of cern was laid at the site of the synchrocyclotron by the first director general of cern felix bloch after its remarkably long 33 years of service time the sc was decommissioned in 1990 nowadays it accepts visitors as an exhibition area in cern a synchrocyclotron as a general idea was invented by edwin mcmillan in 1945 its main purpose is to accelerate charged particles like protons and deutrons the machine consists of two d shaped hollow metal electrodes called dee s with a gap between them connected to a radio frequency rf alternating voltage source these dees are placed on a plane in a way that their openings on the flat sides look at each other the particles inside the syncrocylotron can be accelerated from one dee to the other by the force produced by the electrical field between dees the particles accelerated between dees with this method are rotated by the magnetic field created by two large magnets placed below and above the structure the machine continues to accelerate particles by alternating the

the core implements most of the core of the power isa v 2 06 with hypervisor support but not altivec it has a four issue seven stage out of order pipeline with a double precision fpu three integer units 32 32 kb data and instruction l1 caches 512 kb private l2 cache per core and up to 2 mb shared l3 cache speeds range up to 2 5 ghz and the core is designed to be highly configurable via the corenet fabric and meet the specific needs of embedded applications with features like multi core operation and interface for auxiliary application processing units apu the e5500 is based on the e500mc core and adds some new instructions introduced in the power isa 2 06 specification namely some byte and bit level acceleration parity population count bit permute and compare byte the fpu is taken straight from the powerpc e600 core which is a classic fully pipelined dual precision ieee 754 unit running at full core speed and supports conversion between 64 bit floats and integers effectively twice as fast as the fpu in e500mc the e5500 also introduces an enhanced branch prediction unit with an 8 entry link stack the

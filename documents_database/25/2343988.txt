this generalization is due to igor shafarevich given a polynomial equation or a system of polynomial equations it is often useful to compute or to bound the number of solutions without computing explicitly the solutions in the case of a single equation this problem is solved by the fundamental theorem of algebra which asserts that the number of complex solutions is bounded by the degree of the polynomial with equality if the solutions are counted with their multiplicities in the case of a system of polynomial equations in unknowns the problem is solved by b zout s theorem which asserts that if the number of complex solutions is finite their number is bounded by the product of the degrees of the solutions moreover if the number of solutions at infinity is also finite then the product of the degrees equals the number of solutions counted with multiplicities and including the solutions at infinity however it is rather common that the number of solutions at infinity is infinite in this case the product of the degrees of the polynomials may be much larger than the number of roots and better bounds are useful multi homogeneous b zout theorem provides such a

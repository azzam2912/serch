tug ubl1 is an acronym for tether containing ubx domain for glut4 ubiquitin like 1 this is encoded for by the gene aspscr1 when insulin is secreted glucose uptake of cells increase since insulin stimulates glut4 to move from the intracellular surface to the outer surface in a similar fashion tug retains glut4 within unstimulated cells but when insulin is secreted it causes glut4 to dissociate and so glut4 moves to the cell surface tug binds directly and specifically to a large intracellular loop in glut4 it acts as a tethering protein which along with other proteins retain glut4 within cells in the absence of insulin additionally when the protein tug becomes disrupted it appears to accelerate the degradation of glut4 in lysosomes however the functional role of the tug ubl1 domain remains to be elucidated n terminal ubiquitin like domain tug ubl1 has a tertiary structure of tug ubl1 which consists of a beta grasp or ubiquitin like topology for this domain this comprises a five stranded beta sheet a single major alpha helix residues 32 42 and two short helices tug releases the glut4 containing vesicles gsvs in response to insulin stimulation which allows it to move to

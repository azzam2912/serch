it is most usually desulfurized and then catalytically reformed which rearranges or restructures the hydrocarbon molecules in the naphtha as well as breaking some of the molecules into smaller molecules to produce a high octane component of gasoline or petrol there are hundreds of different petroleum crude oil sources worldwide and each crude oil has its own unique composition or assay there are also hundreds of petroleum refineries worldwide and each of them is designed to process either a specific crude oil or specific types of crude oils naphtha is a general term as each refinery produces its own naphthas with their own unique initial and final boiling points and other physical and compositional characteristics naphthas may also be produced from other material such as coal tar shale deposits tar sands and the destructive distillation of wood the first unit operation in a petroleum refinery is the crude oil distillation unit the overhead liquid distillate from that unit is called virgin or straight run naphtha and that distillate is the largest source of naphtha in most petroleum refineries the naphtha is a mixture of many different hydrocarbon compounds it has an initial boiling point ibp of about 35 c and

it is unique because niobium is usually found in oxide or eventually silicate minerals ekplexite is a case in which chalcophile behaviour of niobium is shown which means niobium present in a sulfide mineral the unique combination of elements in ekplexite has to do with its name which comes from a greek world on surprise the other example of chalcophile behaviour of niobium is edgarite fenbs and both minerals were found in the same environment which is a fenitic rock of mt kaskasnyunchorr khibiny massif kola peninsula russia analysis of the same rock has revealed the presence of two analogues of ekplexite kaskasite molybdenum analogue and manganokaskasite molybdenum and manganese analogue all three minerals belong to the valleriite group and crystallize in the trigonal system with similar possible space groups beside niobium molybdenum sulfur magnesium and aluminium ekplexite contains also relatively small amounts of tungsten vanadium and iron the rock in which contains ekplexite is classified as fenite in this rock ekplexite associates with fluorophlogopite nepheline orthoclase anorthoclasee silicates alabandine edgarite pyrite molybdenite tungstenite sulfides corundum graphite and monazite ce crystal structure of ekplexite is described as non commensurate it is composed of two modules

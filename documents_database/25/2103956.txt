the incidence coloring is a special graph labeling where in each incidence of an edge with a vertex is assigned a color under certain constraints let g v e be a simple graph with vertex set non empty v g and edge set e g an incidence is defined as a pair v e where v v g is an end point of e e g in simple words one says that vertex v is incident to edge e consider a set of incidences say i g v e v v g and e e g and v e the two incidences v e and u f are said to be adjacent if one of the given conditions holds an incidence coloring of g can be defined as a function c i g n such that c v e c u f for any incidences v e and u f that are adjacent this implies that incidence coloring assigns distinct colors to neighborly incidences generally a simplified notation c v u is used instead of c v e the minimum number of colors needed for incidence coloring of a graph is known as incidence chromatic number or incidence coloring number

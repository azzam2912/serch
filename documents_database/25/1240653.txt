it is surrounded by a vast nebula of ejected nuclear processed material because this star has a multiple shell expanding atmosphere this star is among the most luminous stars in the milky way it has very broad emission wings on the balmer lines reminiscent from the broad lines observed in the spectra of o and wolf rayet stars a distance of 5 kpc and a bolometric magnitude of 9 4 put hr car among the most luminous stars of the galaxy hr carinae was first noticed at the start of the 20th century because of its h emission it was placed in secchi class i corresponding to modern a and f type stars it was catalogued in 1933 as a be star and was discovered to be variable in 1940 a more detailed spectroscopic study gave it the type b2eq with emission line of hydrogen helium and ionised iron and p cygni profiles on some lines by 1970 hr carinae and the similar variable ag carinae were recognised as being related to the p cygni variables unstable hot supergiants the group was formally recognised as s doradus variables to avoid confusion with the p cygni spectral features shared with other

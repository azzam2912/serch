one ban or hartley is the information content of an event if the probability of that event occurring is it is therefore equal to the information contained in one decimal digit or dit assuming a priori equiprobability of each possible value as a bit corresponds to a binary digit a ban corresponds to a decimal digit a deciban is one tenth of a ban the name is formed from ban by the si prefix deci one hartley corresponds to log 10 bit ln 10 nat or approximately 3 322 sh or 2 303 nat a deciban is about 0 332 sh though not an si unit the hartley is part of the international system of quantities defined by international standard iec 80000 13 of the international electrotechnical commission it is named after ralph hartley the term hartley is named after ralph hartley who suggested in 1928 to measure information using a logarithmic base equal to the number of distinguishable states in its representation which would be the base 10 for a decimal digit the ban and the deciban were invented by alan turing with i j good in 1940 to measure the amount of information that could be deduced by

asphaltene compounds are the other primary component of asphalt as viscous liquids maltenes consist of heavy dark colored asphaltic resins first acidaffins second acidaffins and saturates combined with lighter colored oils the resins provide the adhesive qualities in asphalts the oils are the carrier medium for both the maltene resins and the asphaltene compounds maltenes are characterized by their lower molecular weight and their solubility in comparison with asphaltenes using adsorption chromatography in the presence of an acid reagent maltenes can be separated into four fractions it had long been suspected that asphalt pavement deterioration resulted from chemical reactions of specific asphalt components in 1959 fritz rostler observed it is generally recognized that failures of asphalt pavements caused by embrittlement and other changes in physical properties during the aging process are due to chemical reactions of all or some of the asphalt components it was rostler who undertook the necessary research to identify the asphalt components and chemical processes contributing to the aging process his methodology was to separate the asphalt components by first using sulfuric acid to separate the soluble components then using an n pentane solvent to separate the insoluble components rostler s work in the rubber industry

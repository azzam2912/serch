it asks whether there are identities involving addition multiplication and exponentiation over the positive integers that cannot be proved using eleven axioms about these operations that are taught in high school level mathematics the question was solved in 1980 by alex wilkie who showed that such unprovable identities do exist tarski considered the following eleven axioms about addition multiplication and exponentiation to be standard axioms taught in high school these eleven axioms sometimes called the high school identities are related to the axioms of an exponential ring tarski s problem then becomes are there identities involving only addition multiplication and exponentiation that are true for all positive integers but that cannot be proved using only the axioms 1 11 since the axioms seem to list all the basic facts about the operations in question it is not immediately obvious that there should be anything provably true one can state using only the three operations but cannot prove with the axioms however proving seemingly innocuous statements can require long proofs using only the above eleven axioms consider the following proof that x 1 x 2 x 1 here brackets are omitted when axiom 2 tells us that there is no confusion

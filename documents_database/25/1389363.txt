it was introduced in early 1995 debuting in systems from hp the pa 7200 was not sold openly and the only third party users were convex computer and stratus computer both members of the precision risc organization pro it was developed for small multiprocessing systems with two or four microprocessors the microprocessor was first described at the compcon and ieee international solid state circuits conference isscc conferences the pa 7200 was mostly derived from the pa 7100 and was improved adding a second integer unit enabling it to issue up to two integer instructions per cycle the second integer unit was not identical to the first and was only capable of executing simple but more frequently used instructions the pa 7200 contained 1 3 million transistors and measured 14 0 mm by 15 0 mm 210 mm it was fabricated by hewlett packard in their cmos14a process which they co developed with analog devices cmos14a was a 0 55 m three level interconnect complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos process the microprocessor uses an unusual 4 4 v power supply as a result of its development it was designed in the 0 8 m cmos26b process and leveraged circuits and layouts

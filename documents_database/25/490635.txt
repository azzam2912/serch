it was proven independently by neil immerman and r bert szelepcs nyi in 1987 for which they shared the 1995 g del prize in its general form the theorem states that nspace s n co nspace s n for any function s n log n the result is equivalently stated as nl co nl although this is the special case when s n log n it implies the general theorem by a standard padding argument the result solved the second lba problem in other words if a nondeterministic machine can solve a problem another machine with the same resource bounds can solve its complement problem with the yes and no answers reversed in the same asymptotic amount of space no similar result is known for the time complexity classes and indeed it is conjectured that np is not equal to co np the principle used to prove the theorem has become known as inductive counting it has also been used to prove other theorems in computational complexity including the closure of logcfl under complementation and the existence of error free randomized logspace algorithms for ustcon the theorem can be proven by showing how to translate any nondeterministic turing machine m

they vary greatly in size or quantity from subatomic particles like the electron to microscopic particles like atoms and molecules to macroscopic particles like powders and other granular materials particles can also be used to create scientific models of even larger objects depending on their density such as humans moving in a crowd or celestial bodies in motion the term particle is rather general in meaning and is refined as needed by various scientific fields anything that is composed of particles may be referred to as being particulate however the noun particulate is most frequently used to refer to pollutants in the earth s atmosphere which are a suspension of unconnected particles rather than a connected particle aggregation the concept of particles is particularly useful when modelling nature as the full treatment of many phenomena can be complex and also involve difficult computation it can be used to make simplifying assumptions concerning the processes involved francis sears and mark zemansky in university physics give the example of calculating the landing location and speed of a baseball thrown in the air they gradually strip the baseball of most of its properties by first idealizing it as a rigid smooth sphere then

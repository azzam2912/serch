for example it can express the ackermann function which not being primitive recursive cannot be written in bloop borrowing from standard terminology in mathematical logic hofstadter calls floop s unbounded loops mu loops like all turing complete programming languages floop suffers from the halting problem programs might not terminate and it is not possible in general to decide which programs do bloop and floop can be regarded as models of computation and have sometimes been used in teaching computability the only variables are codice 1 the return value of the procedure and codice 2 an unbounded sequence of natural number variables indexed by constants as in the the only operators are codice 3 assignment codice 4 addition codice 5 multiplication codice 6 less than codice 7 greater than and codice 8 equals each program uses only a finite number of cells but the numbers in the cells can be arbitrarily large data structures such as lists or stacks can be handled by interpreting the number in a cell in specific ways that is by g del numbering the possible structures control flow constructs include bounded loops conditional statements codice 9 jumps out of loops and codice 10 jumps out of

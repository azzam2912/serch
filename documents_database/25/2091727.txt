node deletion is used to test the robustness and the attack tolerance of networks understanding how a network changes in response to node deletion is critical in many empirical networks application varies across many fields including the breakdown of the world wide web via router removal elimination of epidemics or fighting against criminal organizations removing a node or multiple nodes randomly from a network means that the elimination of a set of nodes happens with a certain probability the probability of deleting a node can follow any distribution the most common is to assume a uniform distribution the effect of the node deletion is highly dependent on the topology of the network so it affects each empirical network differently the effect on the network connectedness is measured with the diameter of the network the length of the longest shortest path between two nodes when we remove a fraction f of nodes the diameter of the network increases monotonically with f this is because each node has approximately the same degree and thus contributes to the interconnectedness by relatively the same amount the effect on a scale free network is very different from what is experienced with random networks as f

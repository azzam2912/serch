the ecosystem may have been stopped from reaching its full climatic climax or deflected towards a different climax by activities such as these are known as disturbances or arresting factors in each case human activity has led to a community which is not the climax community expected in such an area if the human activity continues the community will be held in a stable position and further succession will not occur until the human activity ceases an example may be in a beach dune system where the impact of the human race has caused footpath erosion to occur affecting the vegetation so that feet trampling on the dune plants eventually destroys them the uplands of northern england were once covered by deciduous woodland some heather would have been present but in relatively small amounts gradually the forests were removed during the early middle ages for timber and fuel purposes and to create space for agricultural activities the soil deteriorated as a result and heather came to dominate the plant community sheep grazing was the major form of agriculture in the area at the time and the sheep prevented the re growth of woodland by destroying any young saplings in more

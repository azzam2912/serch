spicules cover about 1 of the sun s surface they move upwards at about 20 km s from the photosphere and last a few minutes each they were discovered in 1877 by angelo secchi but the physical mechanism that generates them is still debated spicules last for about 15 minutes at the solar limb they appear elongated if seen on the disk they are known as mottles or fibrils they are usually associated with regions of high magnetic flux their mass flux is about 100 times that of the solar wind they rise at a rate of 20 km s or 72 000 km h and can reach several thousand kilometers in height before collapsing and fading away there are about 300 000 active spicules at any one time on the sun s chromosphere amounting to about 1 of the sun s surface an individual spicule typically reaches 3 000 10 000 km altitude above the photosphere bart de pontieu lockheed martin solar and astrophysics laboratory palo alto california united states robert erd lyi and stewart james both from the university of sheffield united kingdom hypothesised in 2004 that spicules formed as a result of p mode oscillations in the

that is it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible more generally any edge weighted undirected graph not necessarily connected has a minimum spanning forest which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components there are quite a few use cases for minimum spanning trees one example would be a telecommunications company trying to lay cable in a new neighborhood if it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths e g roads then there would be a graph containing the points e g houses connected by those paths some of the paths might be more expensive because they are longer or require the cable to be buried deeper these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights currency is an acceptable unit for edge weight there is no requirement for edge lengths to obey normal rules of geometry such as the triangle inequality a spanning tree for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects every house there might be several spanning trees possible a minimum spanning tree would be one with the lowest total cost representing

a comedic championship it was created as a parody of wwe s hardcore championship and follows the same 24 7 rules meaning it is constantly being defended anywhere against anyone even outside of matches during unrelated matches or outside a ring as anyone or anything can become champion by pinning the champion or making him submit as long as a referee is there to confirm the win as such not only is the championship winnable regardless of gender or number of individuals in case of a common pinfall or submission it is also available to unconventional champions with past champions including children animals and inanimate objects it has occasionally been won by other means such as an auction for the belt rock paper scissors and even a title change that occurred in a dream the title is typically defended during a 10 minute battle royal with the current holder not being allowed to leave the match until the end of the time limit as per 24 7 rules the championship can change hands during and not only as the result of the match unlike its name suggests and unlike similarly titled championships it is not specific to iron man matches

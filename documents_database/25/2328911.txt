vuv detection provides both qualitative and quantitative spectral information for most gas phase compounds gc vuv spectral data is three dimensional time absorbance wavelength and specific to chemical structure nearly all compounds absorb in the vuv region of the electromagnetic spectrum with the exception of carrier gases hydrogen helium and argon the high energy short wavelength vuv photons probe electronic transitions in almost all chemical bonds including ground state to excited state the result is spectral fingerprints that are specific to individual compound structure and can be readily identified by the vuv library unique vuv spectra enable closely related compounds such as structural isomers to be clearly differentiated vuv detectors complement mass spectrometry which struggles with characterizing constitutional isomers and compounds with low mass quantitation ions vuv spectra can also be used to deconvolve analyte co elution resulting in an accurate quantitative representation of individual analyte contribution to the original response this characteristically lends itself to significantly reducing gc runtimes through flow rate enhanced chromatographic compression vuv spectroscopy follows the simple linear relationship between absorbance and concentration described by the beer lambert law resulting in more accurate retention time based identification vuv absorbance spectra also exhibit feature similarity within compound

plants communicate through a host of volatile organic compounds vocs that can be separated into four broad categories each the product of distinct chemical pathways fatty acid derivatives phenylpropanoids benzenoids amino acid derivatives and terpenoids due to the physical chemical constraints most vocs are of low molecular mass hydrophobic and have high vapor pressures the responses of organisms to plant emitted vocs varies from attracting the predator of a specific herbivore to reduce mechanical damage inflicted on the plant to the induction of chemical defenses of a neighboring plant before it is being attacked in addition the host of vocs emitted varies from plant to plant where for example the venus fly trap can emit vocs to specifically target and attract starved prey while these vocs typically lead to an increase in herbivory resistance in neighboring plants there is no clear benefit to the emitting plant in helping nearby plants as such whether neighboring plants have evolved the capability to eavesdrop or whether there is an unknown tradeoff occurring is subject to much scientific debate communication between mycorrhizae and plants the host legume roots leaches out a specific kind of proteins called lectins which diffuse in soil and interact with

geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as mars or the moon modern geology significantly overlaps all other earth sciences including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated earth system science and planetary science geology describes the structure of the earth on and beneath its surface and the processes that have shaped that structure it also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given location and also to describe the histories of those rocks by combining these tools geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the earth as a whole and also to demonstrate the age of the earth geology provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics the evolutionary history of life and the earth s past climates geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the earth s structure and evolution including field work rock description geophysical techniques chemical analysis physical experiments and numerical modelling in practical terms geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation evaluating water resources understanding of natural hazards the remediation of environmental problems

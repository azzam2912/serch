the mainshock had a moment magnitude of 7 7 and a maximum mercalli intensity of vii very strong at least 825 people were killed and hundreds more were injured on 28 september a m6 8 aftershock occurred to the north at a depth of killing at least 22 people on a broad scale the tectonics of southern and central pakistan reflect a complex plate boundary where the india plate slides northward relative to the eurasia plate in the east and the arabia plate subducts northward beneath the eurasia plate in the makran western pakistan these motions typically result in north south to northeast southwest strike slip motion at the latitude of the 24 september earthquake that is primarily accommodated on the chaman fault with the earthquake potentially occurring on one of the southern most strands of this fault system further more in depth studies will be required to identify the precise fault associated with this event although seismically active this portion of the eurasia plate boundary region has not experienced large damaging earthquakes in recent history in the past 40 years only one significant event has occurred within of this event which was a m 6 1 earthquake in july

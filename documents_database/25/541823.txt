regardless of the ultimate destination of the solar power though the central problem addressed by mppt is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on both the amount of sunlight falling on the solar panels and the electrical characteristics of the load as the amount of sunlight varies the load characteristic that gives the highest power transfer efficiency changes so that the efficiency of the system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep the power transfer at highest efficiency this load characteristic is called the maximum power point mpp and mppt is the process of finding this point and keeping the load characteristic there electrical circuits can be designed to present arbitrary loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage current or frequency to suit other devices or systems and mppt solves the problem of choosing the best load to be presented to the cells in order to get the most usable power out solar cells have a complex relationship between temperature and total resistance that produces a non linear output efficiency which can be analyzed based on the i v curve it is the purpose of the mppt system to sample

the protein has 27 introns which allows for many isoforms of this gene it has several aliases the most common of which is stabilin 1 interacting chitinase like protein si clp as indicated by the alias chid1 is known to interact with the protein stab1 chid1 is expressed ubiquitously at levels nearly 6 times the average gene and is conserved very far back to organisms such as caenorhabditis elegans and possibly some prokaryotes this protein is known to have carbohydrate binding sites which could be involved in carbohydrate catabolysis chid1 is located on chromosome 11 at the location p15 5 it is just downstream of tspan4 and upstream of ap2a2 chid1 is ubiquitously expressed at a high levels through microarray analysis it has been shown that chid1 is generally expressed at 5 7 times the average gene chid1 has many known variants which is attributed to its 37 exons there are no inherent repeats or hairpin structures to be found within the coding region of chid1 this gene is a member of the gh18 superfamily which dictates some of its protein structure this gene also has several aliases the most common of which is stabilin 1 interacting chitinase like protein

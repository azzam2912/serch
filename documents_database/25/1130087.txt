this gene encodes an nuclear encoded accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain nadh dehydrogenase complex i or nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex i removes electrons from nadh and passes them to the electron acceptor ubiquinone mutations in this gene can cause mitochondrial complex i deficiencies such as leigh syndrome ndufs4 is located on the q arm of chromosome 5 in position 11 2 and has 8 exons the ndufs4 gene produces a 20 1 kda protein composed of 175 amino acids ndufs4 the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the complex i ndufs4 subunit family it is a peripheral membrane protein located on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane ndufs4 is a component of the iron sulfur ip fragment of the enzyme and contains a transit peptide domain 4 turns 6 beta strands and 4 alpha helixes alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants complex i or nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase the first multisubunit enzyme complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain plays a vital role in cellular atp production the primary source of energy for many crucial processes in living cells it removes electrons from nadh and passes them by a series of different protein

these rides were very similar in their basic design to many modern day shuttle roller coasters i e they did not make a complete circuit but with only one lift hill and no launch a single roller coaster car would ascend to the peak on the coaster before descending rapidly down the same hill and then passing through the central loop with enough speed and centrifugal force to remain on the track at the top of the loop the size of these centrifugal railways differed some were purported to have vertical loops of a mere while others were estimated to be although as described below early coaster designers were prone to cases of gross exaggeration it was not long after the creation of the first wheeled roller coasters in the late 18th century or the early 19th century that the first roller coaster inversion was designed this first design was created in 1833 by an engineer named clavieres but it was not implemented into a functioning ride until more than a decade later in 1843 designers hutchinson and higgins registered a design and exhibited a centrifugal iron railway at theaters in various british cities including london manchester and liverpool a

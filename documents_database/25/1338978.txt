unlike the classical clt which requires that the random variables in question have finite variance and be both independent and identically distributed lindeberg s clt only requires that they have finite variance satisfy lindeberg s condition and be independent it is named after the finnish mathematician jarl waldemar lindeberg let formula 1 be a probability space and formula 2 be independent random variables defined on that space assume the expected values formula 3 and variances formula 4 exist and are finite also let formula 5 if this sequence of independent random variables formula 6 satisfies lindeberg s condition for all formula 8 where 1 is the indicator function then the central limit theorem holds i e the random variables converge in distribution to a standard normal random variable as formula 10 lindeberg s condition is sufficient but not in general necessary i e the inverse implication does not hold in general however if the sequence of independent random variables in question satisfies then lindeberg s condition is both sufficient and necessary i e it holds if and only if the result of central limit theorem holds feller s theorem can be used as an alternative method to prove that lindeberg

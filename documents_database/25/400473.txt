typical of mid sized machines of the era they used core memory drum storage and punched cards but they were unusual in that they were based on decimal logic instead of binary the 1301 was designed by an ict and gec joint subsidiary computer developments limited cdl at gec s coventry site the 1301 was the main machine in the line its main memory came in increments of 400 words of 48 bits 12 decimal digits or 12 four bit binary values 0 15 plus two parity bits the maximum size was 4 000 words it was the first ict machine to use core memory backing store was magnetic drum and optionally one inch half inch or quarter inch wide magnetic tape input was from 80 column punched cards and optionally 160 column punched cards and punched paper tape output was to 80 column punched cards line printer and optionally to punched paper tape the machine ran at a clock speed of 1 mhz and its arithmetic logic unit alu operated on data in a serial parallel fashion the 48 bit words were processed sequentially four bits at a time a simple addition took 21 clock cycles hardware multiplication averaged

his research investigates the strong interaction of quantum chromodynamics qcd the theory of quarks and gluons salam was educated at the lyc e fran ais charles de gaulle in london and the university of cambridge where he was awarded a bachelor of arts degree in 1993 followed by a phd in particle physics in 1996 during his postgraduate study he was based in the cavendish laboratory where his research investigated the scattering of quarkonium funded by the particle physics and astronomy research council pparc salam s research explores the ways in which qcd can be exploited to understand elementary particle interactions notably the higgs boson and also how it can be harnessed in the search for new particles he has made significant contributions to the understanding of the structure of the proton and of jets cones of hadrons the signatures of quarks and gluons produced in high energy collisions he invented the most widely used approach for identifying jets at the large hadron collider before working at cern salam held appointments at princeton university in the united states and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare infn in milan he joined the centre national de la recherche scientifique cnrs in 2000

light from the occulted object is blocked by the moon and a perceptible shadow of the moon is cast onto the ground if that ground is in night time facing away from the sun the moon s shadow moves west to east due to the orbit of the moon and the rotation of the earth as shown on the image at left the left western ellipse represents moonrise for that region of the globe the right eastern ellipse represents moon set for that region the northern and southern path limits are shown in the example shown weather conditions allowing sites between the white lines will see the event at night sites between the blue lines will see the event during twilight and sites between the red dotted lines during the day time for stars brighter than of a number lower than second magnitude kaguya lunar orbiter a team of many observers can combine observed events and construct an extremely accurate profile of the lunar terrain since graze paths rarely pass over established observatories amateur astronomers use portable observing equipment and travel to sites along the shadow path limits the goal is to report the utc of each event as accurately

unlike papal tombs the tombs of antipopes have generally not been preserved with a few notable exceptions several tombs of antipopes were desecrated and destroyed often by their rival claimants shortly after their creation for example pope innocent ii razed santa maria in trastevere one of the main marian basilicas and one of the oldest churches of rome to the ground and was eventually buried over the spot once occupied by the tomb of his rival pope anacletus ii others survived centuries only to be destroyed during conflicts such as the french revolution and the war of the spanish succession a fate common to some non extant papal tombs such was the case with the tomb of antipope felix v the last historical antipope who was buried with most of his predecessors as count of savoy in hautecombe abbey others are obscure because of the damnatio memoriae surrounding the lives of antipopes or because they were refused burial due to excommunication some of those can be presumed to have been buried unceremoniously in the monasteries to which the antipopes were confined after submitting or losing power the exception is hippolytus of rome the first antipope who was translated to rome

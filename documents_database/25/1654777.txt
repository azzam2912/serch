it was developed by jacob bekenstein and mordehai milgrom in their 1984 paper does the missing mass problem signal the breakdown of newtonian gravity aqual stands for a quadratic lagrangian the gravitational force law obtained from mond has a serious defect it violates newton s third law of motion and therefore fails to conserve momentum and energy to see this consider two objects with formula 2 then we have but the third law gives formula 4 so we would get even though formula 6 and formula 7 would therefore be constant contrary to the mond assumption that it is linear for small arguments this problem can be rectified by deriving the force law from a lagrangian at the cost of possibly modifying the general form of the force law then conservation laws could then be derived from the lagrangian by the usual means the aqual lagrangian is where the predicted acceleration is formula 9 these equations reduce to the mond equations in the spherically symmetric case although they differ somewhat in the disc case needed for modelling spiral or lenticular galaxies however the difference is only 10 15 so does not seriously impact the results according to sanders and mcgaugh

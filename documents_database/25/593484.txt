it consists of 7 suborders 59 families 373 genera and 666 species the cyclostome bryozoans were dominant in the mesozoic since that era they have decreased currently cyclostomes seldom constitute more than 20 of the species recorded in regional bryozoan faunas traditionally cyclostomes have been divided into two groups according to skeletal organization in free walled or double walled cyclostomes the exterior frontal walls of the zooids are uncalcified autozooids have either a polygonal aperture bounded by vertical interior walls or alternatively a subcircular aperture in species with kenozooids filling the spaces between the autozooids by contrast fixed walled or single walled cyclostomes have much of the exterior frontal wall calcified autozooids normally have a subcircular aperture located at or close to the frontal wall among cyclostome bryozoans the calcitic skeleton is usually lamellar consisting of tabular or lath like crystallites stacked like tiles at a low angle to the wall surface cheilostome bryozoans may exhibit a similar ultrastructure but more commonly have fibrous skeletons consisting of needle like or bladed crystallites oriented almost perpendicular to wall surfaces the skeletal parts of individual feeding zooids autozooecia are typically long curved tubes with terminal apertures which are either circular or polygonal

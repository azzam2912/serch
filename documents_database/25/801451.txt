at the end of the two page published paper ramanujan derived a generalized result and that is where formula 2 is the prime counting function equal to the number of primes less than or equal to x the converse of this result is the definition of ramanujan primes the first five ramanujan primes are thus 2 11 17 29 and 41 note that the integer r is necessarily a prime number formula 4 and hence formula 2 must increase by obtaining another prime at x r since formula 4 can increase by at most 1 for all formula 8 the bounds hold if formula 10 then also where p is the n th prime number as n tends to infinity r is asymptotic to the 2 n th prime i e all these results were proved by sondow 2009 except for the upper bound r p which was conjectured by him and proved by laishram 2010 the bound was improved by sondow nicholson and noe 2011 to which is the optimal form of r c p since it is an equality for n 5

the starting material for isosorbide is d sorbitol which is obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of d glucose which is in turn produced by hydrolysis of starch isosorbide is discussed as a plant based platform chemical from which biodegradable derivatives of various functionality can be obtained isosorbide is currently of great scientific and technical interest as a monomer building block for biopolymeric polycarbonates polyesters polyurethanes and epoxides hydrogenation of glucose gives sorbitol isosorbide is obtained by acid catalyzed dehydration of d sorbitol which yields the monocyclic furanoid sorbitan which in turn forms by further dehydration the bicyclic furofuran derivative isosorbide the reaction gives about 70 to 80 isosorbide in addition to 30 to 20 of undesirable by products which have to be removed costly by distillation recrystallization from alcohols recrystallization from the melt by a combination of these methods or by deposition from the vapor phase a high purity product 99 8 is essential for the use of a monomer when uncoloured high molecular weight polymers shall be obtained isosorbide is a white crystalline highly hydrophilic solid the two secondary hydroxy groups in the v shaped bicyclic system possess different orientations leading to different chemical reactivities this allows a selective monoderivatization

soils have become degraded in locations where farmers have cleared perennial vegetation to grow crops and graze animals exposing the soil to erosion by wind and water in total one third of the world s population lives in drylands where land degradation is reducing food supplies biodiversity water quality and soil fertility the bioreclamation of degraded lands bdl system was developed by the international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics icrisat with the aim of helping reverse damage to soils caused by overgrazing and intensive farming laterite soils have a high clay content which means they have higher cation exchange capacity and water holding capacity than sandy soils however when they become degraded a hard crust can form on the surface which hinders water infiltration and the emergence of seedlings the bdl system involves using indigenous water harvesting methods such as planting pits and trenches applying animal and plant residues and planting high value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that can tolerate drought conditions icrisat has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite soils in niger and increase smallholder farmers incomes at the same time trials have demonstrated that a 200 m plot can yield an income

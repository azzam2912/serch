cannabigerol is the non acidic form of cannabigerolic acid the parent molecule from which other cannabinoids are synthesized cannabigerol is a minor constituent of cannabis during growth most of the cannabigerol is converted into other cannabinoids primarily tetrahydrocannabinol thc or cannabidiol cbd leaving about 1 cannabigerol in the plant the biosynthesis of cannabigerol begins by loading hexanoyl coa onto a polyketide synthase assembly protein and subsequent condensation with three molecules of malonyl coa this polyketide is cyclized to olivetolic acid via olivetolic acid cyclase and then prenylated with a ten carbon isoprenoid precursor geranyl pyrophosphate using an aromatic prenyltransferase enzyme geranyl pyrophosphate olivetolic acid geranyltransferase to biosynthesize cannabigerolic acid which can then be decarboxylated to yield cannabigerol no clinical research has been conducted to test the specific effects of cannabigerol in humans cannabigerol is under laboratory research to determine its pharmacological properties and potential effects in disease conditions contrary to the major psychoactive cannabinoid thc cannabigerol antagonizes cb1 receptors and is both a alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist and moderate 5ht1a receptor antagonist cannabigerol displays cb1 and cb2 binding affinity additionally cannabigerol has been evaluated in laboratory models of colitis cannabigerol is not scheduled by the un convention on psychotropic substances in

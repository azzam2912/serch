according to street s 1979 description of european lizards and snakes in those that have keeled scales the keels are usually stronger in male specimens and are consistently arranged according to the species of reptiles even though many others do not have them with european lizards the dorsal scales are usually well keeled while those on the flanks are more weakly keeled and those on the belly smooth klauber 1997 describes how the keels on the scales of rattlesnakes are particularly strong mid dorsally but gradually weaken on the lateral rows with the ventral scales being smooth he stated that the function of the keels was uncertain but that since they reduced shininess and thus made it easier for the animals to conceal themselves it afforded them an evolutionary advantage in some vipers most notably those of the genus echis the lateral scales are not only keeled but the keels have minute serrations the snakes use this in a warning threat display the body is arranged into a series of parallel c shaped counterlooped coils that they rub together continuously to produce a sizzling sound rather like water on a hot plate this method of making sound is called stridulation

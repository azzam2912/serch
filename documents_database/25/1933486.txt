it is used to detect viable microorganisms by qpcr visible light high power halogen lamps or specific led devices induces a photoreaction of the chemical that will lead to a covalent bond with pma and the dsdna this process renders the dna insoluble and results in its loss during subsequent genomic dna extraction theoretically dead microorganisms lose their capability to maintain their membranes intact which leaves the naked dna in the cytosol ready to react with pma dna of living organisms are not exposed to the pma as they have an intact cell membrane after treatment with the chemical only the dna from living bacteria is usable in qpcr allowing to obtain only the amplified dna of living organisms this is helpful in determining which pathogens are active in specific samples the main use of pma is in viability pcr but the same principle can be applied in flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy however the ability of pma in differentiating viable and non viable cells varies for different bacteria an example is that the permeability of pma to gram positive and gram negative cell membranes is different therefore the application of pma to mixed communities is still limited pma was

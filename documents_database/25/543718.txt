the term astn replaces the term ason automatically switched optical network and is often used interchangeably with gmpls generalized mpls this is not completely correct as gmpls is a family of protocols but ason astn is an optical transport network architecture the requirements of the ason astn architecture can be satisfied using gmpls protocols developed by the ietf or by gmpls protocols that have been modified by the itu furthermore the gmpls protocols are applicable to optical and non optical e g packet and frame networks and can be used in transport or client networks thus gmpls is a wider concept than astn traditionally creating traffic paths through a series of network elements has involved configuration of individual cross connects on each network element astn allows the user to specify the start point end point and bandwidth required and the astn agent on the network elements will allocate the path through the network provisioning the traffic path setting up cross connects and allocating bandwidth from the paths for the user requested service the actual path that the traffic will take through the network is not specified by the user changes to the network adding removing nodes will be taken into

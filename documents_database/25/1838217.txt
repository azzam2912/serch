when impaired the body naturally reconstructs new neurological pathways and redirects activity the field of restorative neurology works to accentuate these new pathways and primarily focuses on the theory of the plasticity of an impaired nervous system its main goal is to take a broken down and disordered nervous system and return it to a state of normal function certain treatment strategies are used to augment instead of fully replace any performance of surviving and also improving the potential of motor neuron functions this rehabilitation of motor neurons allows patients a therapeutic approach to recovery opposed to physical structural reconstruction it is applied in a wide range of disorders of the nervous system including upper motor neuron dysfunctions like spinal cord injury cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injury including stroke and neuromuscular diseases as well as for control of pain and spasticity instead of applying a reconstructive neurobiological approach i e structural modifications restorative neurology relies on improving residual function while subspecialties like neurosurgery and pharmacology exist and are useful in diagnosing and treating conditions of the nervous system restorative neurology takes a pathophysiological approach instead of heavily relying on neurochemistry or perhaps an anatomical discipline restorative neurology

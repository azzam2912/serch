as with pixels in a 2d bitmap voxels themselves do not typically have their position coordinates explicitly encoded with their values instead rendering systems can infer the position of a voxel based upon its position relative to other voxels i e its position in the data structure that makes up a single volumetric image in contrast to pixels and voxels polygons are often explicitly represented by the coordinates of their vertices points a direct consequence of this difference is that polygons can efficiently represent simple 3d structures with lots of empty or homogeneously filled space while voxels excel at representing regularly sampled spaces that are non homogeneously filled voxels are frequently used in the visualization and analysis of medical and scientific data e g gis some volumetric displays use voxels to describe their resolution for example a cubic volumetric display might be able to show 512 512 512 voxels the word voxel originated analogously to the word pixel with vo representing volume and el representing element similar formations with el for element include the words pixel and texel a volume described as voxels can be visualized either by direct volume rendering or by the extraction of polygon iso surfaces that

the rna polymerase enzyme transcribes genes into primary transcript mrna known as pre mrna leading to processed mature mrna this mature mrna is then translated into a polymer of amino acids a protein as summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology as in dna mrna genetic information is in the sequence of nucleotides which are arranged into codons consisting of three base pairs each each codon encodes for a specific amino acid except the stop codons which terminate protein synthesis this process of translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of rna transfer rna trna that mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid and ribosomal rna rrna that is the central component of the ribosome s protein manufacturing machinery the existence of mrna was first suggested by jacques monod and fran ois jacob and subsequently discovered by jacob sydney brenner and matthew meselson at the california institute of technology in 1961 it should not be confused with mitochondrial dna the brief existence of an mrna molecule begins with transcription and ultimately ends in degradation during its life an mrna molecule may also be processed edited and transported prior to translation eukaryotic mrna

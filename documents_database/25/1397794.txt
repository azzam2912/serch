among the various methods of thermal plasma generation induction plasma or inductively coupled plasma takes up an important role early attempts to maintain inductively coupled plasma on a stream of gas date back to babat in 1947 and reed in 1961 effort was concentrated on the fundamental studies of energy coupling mechanism and the characteristics of the flow temperature and concentration fields in plasma discharge in 1980s there was increasing interest in high performance materials and other scientific issues and in induction plasma for industrial scale applications such as waste treatment numerous research and development were devoted to bridge the gap between the laboratory gadget and the industry integration after decades effort induction plasma technology has gained a firm foothold in modern advanced industry induction heating is a mature technology with centuries of history a conductive metallic piece inside a coil of high frequency will be induced and heated to the red hot state there is no difference in cardinal principle for either induction heating or inductively coupled plasma only that the medium to induce in the latter case is replaced by the flowing gas and the temperature obtained is extremely high as it arrives the fourth state of the

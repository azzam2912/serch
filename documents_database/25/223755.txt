with the metric signature the gravitational part of the action is given as where formula 2 is the determinant of the metric tensor matrix formula 3 is the ricci scalar and formula 4 is einstein s constant formula 5 is the gravitational constant and formula 6 is the speed of light in vacuum if it converges the integral is taken over the whole spacetime if it does not converge formula 7 is no longer well defined but a modified definition where one integrates over arbitrarily large relatively compact domains still yields the einstein equation as the euler lagrange equation of the einstein hilbert action the action was first proposed by david hilbert in 1915 the derivation of equations from an action has several advantages first of all it allows for easy unification of general relativity with other classical field theories such as maxwell theory which are also formulated in terms of an action in the process the derivation from an action identifies a natural candidate for the source term coupling the metric to matter fields moreover the action allows for the easy identification of conserved quantities through noether s theorem by studying symmetries of the action in general relativity the

hanns klemm who had previously worked for both zeppelin and the daimler aircraft company while working at daimler klemm had developed his ideas for a light aircraft to be made of wood for strength and lightness it should be easy to manufacture aerodynamically efficient with low mass and wing loading for which a low powered engine would be sufficient klemm s first design the daimler l 15 was a light aircraft with a single 7 5 hp 5 5 kw indian motorcycle engine this aircraft flew in early 1919 although a 12 hp 8 8 kw harley davidson engine was used instead of the originally envisioned engine klemm then designed a squared off version of the cylindrical fuselage of the l 15 which could be more easily built which he designated the l 20 and he founded his own company to produce it this aircraft of which more than 100 were built was powered by a 20 hp 15 kw daimler engine designed by ferdinand porsche in 1928 friedrich karl von koenig warthausen made a solo flight to moscow in a klemm l 20 then decided to keep on going circumnavigating the world and earning himself the hindenburg cup the

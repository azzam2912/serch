the steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder this pushing force is transformed by a connecting rod and flywheel into rotational force for work the term steam engine is generally applied only to reciprocating engines as just described not to the steam turbine steam engines are external combustion engines where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products the ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the rankine cycle in general usage the term steam engine can refer to either complete steam plants including boilers etc such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine steam driven devices were known as early as the aeolipile in the first century ad with a few other uses recorded in the 16th and 17th century thomas savery s dewatering pump used steam pressure operating directly on the water the first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was developed in 1712 by thomas newcomen james watt made a critical improvement by removing spent steam to

it can be described as a variation which may arise due to mutation or alteration in the genomic loci that can be observed a genetic marker may be a short dna sequence such as a sequence surrounding a single base pair change single nucleotide polymorphism snp or a long one like minisatellites for many years gene mapping was limited to identifying organisms by traditional phenotype markers this included genes that encoded easily observable characteristics such as blood types or seed shapes the insufficient number of these types of characteristics in several organisms limited the mapping efforts that could be done this prompted the development of gene markers which could identify genetic characteristics that are not readily observable in organisms such as protein variation some commonly used types of genetic markers are molecular genetic markers can be divided into two classes a biochemical markers which detect variation at the gene product level such as changes in proteins and amino acids and b molecular markers which detect variation at the dna level such as nucleotide changes deletion duplication inversion and or insertion markers can exhibit two modes of inheritance i e dominant recessive or co dominant if the genetic pattern of homo

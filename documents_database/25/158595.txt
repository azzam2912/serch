the md5 hash functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file as with all such hashing algorithms there is theoretically an unlimited number of files that will have any given md5 hash however it is very unlikely that any two non identical files in the real world will have the same md5 hash unless they have been specifically created to have the same hash the underlying md5 algorithm is no longer deemed secure thus while is well suited for identifying known files in situations that are not security related it should not be relied on if there is a chance that files have been purposefully and maliciously tampered in the latter case the use of a newer hashing tool such as sha256sum is recommended the original c code was written by ulrich drepper and extracted from a 2001 release of glibc all of the following files are assumed to be in the current directory file contains hash and filename pairs note there must be two spaces or a space and an asterisk between each md5sum value and filename to be compared the second space indicates text mode the asterisk binary mode otherwise the following error will result no properly

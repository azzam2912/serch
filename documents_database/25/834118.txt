the principles behind the game are based on the work of british mathematician percy alexander macmahon the original game was for up to 8 players and used 60 tiles a later more compact version for up to four players uses 36 tiles it is this version that is described here the game uses colourful double sided triangular playing tiles called trangs the trangs use all the permutations of red yellow green cyan and magenta to give 35 unique trangs plus one all white joker each trang is marked with a number that is the basic scoring value of that tile the trangs are played onto a triangular game board some of the spaces are marked with a number that is the bonus value of the space unmarked spaces having a bonus value of 1 the aim of the multi player game is to score the most points by playing your trangs most effectively all the trangs are placed in the cloth bag provided each player then draws a trang from the bag the player drawing the highest valued trang becomes the opening player the trangs are returned to the bag and each player then draws a hand of four trangs

personal computers now have the capacity to process information easier and quicker than ever before and so today s computer could be considered an important or even essential tool in translation however problems arise in the use of computers in translation as the computer is no substitute for traditional tools such as monolingual and bilingual dictionaries terminologies and encyclopaedias on paper or in digital format and although we can easily access a large amount of information we need to find the right and reliable information here corpora and concordancing software play an important role since gaining access to information about language content and translation practices which was hardly available to translators before the present stage of ict development machine translation from corpus linguistics is based in the analysis of real samples with its own translations among the different devices that use corpus there are statistical methods and based on examples the main objective of statistic machine translation is to generate translations from statistical methods based in corpus of bilingual texts for instance european parliament minutes are written in all eu european union official languages if there were more of this corpus we would get excellent results of translation of texts

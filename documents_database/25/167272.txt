this pathway is responsible for the deamination of most amino acids this is one of the major degradation pathways which convert essential amino acids to non essential amino acids amino acids that can be synthesized de novo by the organism transamination in biochemistry is accomplished by enzymes called transaminases or aminotransferases ketoglutarate acts as the predominant amino group acceptor and produces glutamate as the new amino acid glutamate s amino group in turn is transferred to oxaloacetate in a second transamination reaction yielding aspartate transamination catalyzed by aminotransferase occurs in two stages in the first step the amino group of an amino acid is transferred to the enzyme producing the corresponding keto acid and the aminated enzyme during the second stage the amino group is transferred to the keto acid acceptor forming the amino acid product while regenerating the enzyme the chirality of an amino acid is determined during transamination for the reaction to complete aminotransferases require participation of aldehyde containing coenzyme pyridoxal 5 phosphate plp a derivative of pyridoxine vitamin b the amino group is accommodated by conversion of this coenzyme to pyridoxamine 5 phosphate pmp plp is covalently attached to the enzyme via a schiff base linkage formed

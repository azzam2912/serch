it is one of the three isomers of dimethylbenzene known collectively as xylenes the p stands for para indicating that the two methyl groups in p xylene occupy the diametrically opposite substituent positions 1 and 4 it is in the positions of the two methyl groups their arene substitution pattern that it differs from the other isomers o xylene and m xylene all have the same chemical formula ch ch all xylene isomers are colorless and highly flammable the odor threshold of p xylene is 0 62 parts per million ppm the production of p xylene is industrially significant with annual demand estimated at 37 million tons in 2014 and still on the increase p xylene is produced by catalytic reforming of petroleum naphtha as part of the btx aromatics benzene toluene and the xylene isomers extracted from the catalytic reformate the p xylene is then separated out in a series of distillation adsorption or crystallization and reaction processes from the m xylene o xylene and ethylbenzene its melting point is the highest among this series of isomers but simple crystallization does not allow easy purification due to the formation of eutectic mixtures such separation procedures are major cost factors

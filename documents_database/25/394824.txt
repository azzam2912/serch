it is a white crystalline hygroscopic solid that is highly soluble in water and in alcohol it is usually encountered as the monohydrate the compound is noteworthy as the most water soluble of the common perchlorate salts sodium perchlorate is present on the planet mars its heat of formation is 382 75 kj mol i e it is favorable for it to decompose into sodium chloride and dioxygen it crystallizes in the rhombic crystal system sodium perchlorate is the precursor to many other perchlorate salts often taking advantage of their low solubility relative to naclo 209 g 100 ml at 25 c perchloric acid is made by treating naclo with hcl ammonium and potassium perchlorate of interest in pyrotechnics are prepared by double decomposition from a solution of sodium perchlorate and potassium or ammonium chlorides solutions of naclo are often used as an unreactive electrolyte it is used in standard dna extraction and hybridization reactions in molecular biology sodium perchlorate can be used to block iodine uptake before administration of iodinated contrast agents in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism suppressed tsh sodium perchlorate may also be used as a material to train canines to detect bomb materials sodium perchlorate is produced

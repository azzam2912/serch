whilst the initial testing of the stones inclusions conducted in 1989 concluded that the inclusions were made up of ilmenite for the black blades and triangles and hematite for the orange platelets with the advancement in technology over the last 3 decades a recently conducted more in depth analysis has found the black blades and triangle inclusions in rainbow lattice to be magnetite hematite fe2o3 which are small mainly yellow to deep orange platelets which can be hexagonal shape and are generally in one plane within the feldspar this effect is called aventurescence or sunstone effect which gives some of the gems an orange glow magnetite feo iron oxide which creates the lattice effect this forms as a very thin blades that occur in one plane at different levels these blades orientate north south in different levels by a process known as lamellar twinning and also displays sagentic twinning which forms the lattice pattern the magnetite inclusions in many cases have oxidized or altered through geophysical processes to give the iridescence or rainbow effect across the lattice patterning the magnetite that has no alteration remains black with a metallic sheen the magnetite also predominantly forms equilateral triangles and the lattice

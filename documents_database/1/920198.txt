the related process of the scattering of light by light also a consequence of vacuum polarization was not observed until 1998 in both cases it is a process described by quantum electrodynamics from 1932 to 1937 max delbr ck worked in berlin as an assistant to lise meitner who was collaborating with otto hahn on the results of irradiating uranium with neutrons during this period he wrote a few papers one of which turned out to be an important contribution on the scattering of gamma rays by a coulomb field due to polarization of the vacuum produced by that field 1933 his conclusion proved to be theoretically sound but inapplicable to the case in point but 20 years later hans bethe confirmed the phenomenon and named it delbr ck scattering in 1953 robert wilson observed delbr ck scattering of 1 33 mev gamma rays by the electric fields of lead nuclei addendum delbr ck scattering is the coherent elastic scattering of photons in the coulomb field of heavy nuclei it is one of the two nonlinear effects of quantum electrodynamics qed in the coulomb field investigated experimentally the other is the splitting of a photon into two photons delbr ck

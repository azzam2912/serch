trailing the hydrophones behind the vessel on a cable that can be kilometres long keeps the array s sensors away from the ship s own noise sources greatly improving its signal to noise ratio and hence the effectiveness of detecting and tracking faint contacts such as quiet low noise emitting submarine threats or seismic signals a towed array offers superior resolution and range compared with hull mounted sonar it also covers the baffles the blind spot of hull mounted sonar however effective use of the system limits a vessel s speed and care must be taken to protect the cable from damage during world war i a towed sonar array known as the electric eel was developed by harvey hayes a u s navy physicist this system is believed to be the first towed sonar array design it employed two cables each with a dozen hydrophones attached the project was discontinued after the war the u s navy resumed development of towed array technology during the 1960s in response to the development of nuclear powered submarines by the soviet union on surface ships towed array cables are normally stored in drums then spooled out behind the vessel when in use

zacher in a dermestid beetle culture the genus lardoglyphus was erected by anthonie cornelis oudemans in 1927 the species is known to be a pest to institutional as well as private dermestid beetle colonies lardoglyphus zacheri has been less studied than its congener l konoi which is occasionally called the fish mite and has been known to threaten supplies of cured fish as a food supply threat the latter species is therefore more of a concern however much can be inferred about l zacheri by studying l konoi the latter of which is known to thrive in humid environments thus lardoglyphus species can be expected to become pests in many tropical and subtropical situations especially where ambient conditions are humid some researchers have asserted that devastating l zacheri infestations can occur in any climate when their target is a dermestid beetle colony the high humidity levels produced in the often enclosed colonies are the likely cause of such infestations even when said colonies are located in relatively dry climates scientists believe that cured fish infestations of l zacheri are initiated by dermestid carrion beetles that carry hypopi to the fish source in the first place for this reason researchers interested

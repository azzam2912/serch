a plasma etcher produces a plasma from a process gas typically oxygen or a fluorine bearing gas using a high frequency electric field typically 13 56 mhz a silicon wafer is placed in the plasma etcher and the air is evacuated from the process chamber using a system of vacuum pumps then a process gas is introduced at low pressure and is excited into a plasma through dielectric breakdown plasma can be used to grow a silicon dioxide film on a silicon wafer using an oxygen plasma or can be used to remove silicon dioxide by using a fluorine bearing gas when used in conjunction with photolithography silicon dioxide can be selectively applied or removed to trace paths for circuits for the formation of integrated circuits it is necessary to structure various layers this can be done with a plasma etcher before etching a photoresist is deposited on the surface illuminated through a mask and developed the dry etch is then performed so that structured etching is achieved after the process the remaining photoresist has to be removed this is also done in a special plasma etcher called an asher dry etching allows a reproducible uniform etching of all materials

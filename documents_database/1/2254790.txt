it uses a roller assembly to simulate a road in a controlled environment usually inside a building there are many types of chassis dynamometer according to the target application for example emissions measurement miles accumulation chassis dynamometer macd noise vibration harshness nvh or acoustic application electromagnetic compatibility emc testing end of line eol tests performance measurement and tuning another basic division is by type of vehicle motorcycles cars trucks tractors or the size of the roller mostly 25 48 72 but also any other modern dynamometers used for development are mostly one roller to the wheel construction and the vehicle wheel is placed the top of the roller older constructional solutions are two roller per wheel and vehicle is place between these rollers this design solution is cheaper and simpler however due to the requirements for accuracy and strict limits is no longer used for the development of new vehicles but only as a test dynamometer at the end of the line or to measure the performance of the engine without dismantling or performance tuning in garage companies directly measured variables are only force on the torque transducer i e loadcell and revolutions measured on the role encoder dynamometer all

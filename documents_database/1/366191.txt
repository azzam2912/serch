a quadrant begins with a cardinal house the house in which a chart angle lies proceeds to a succedent house and ends with a cadent house there are four quadrants in an astrological chart providing four cardinal four succedent and four cadent houses the greeks called the cadent houses apoklima which literally means falling or decline because the houses were seen to be falling away from the strength of the angular houses which were considered to be most influential because of their perpendicular and oppositive relationships to the ascendant the word apoklima also carries a denotation of degeneration and decline our english word cadent comes from the latin translation of apoklima and is the source of our word cadet which originally meant a lesser branch of the family or the younger son cadent houses are therefore usually considered by astrologers as less fertile and productive places by their nature than either angular or succedent houses and the planets located in them are seen as generally less powerful and comfortable this view of cadency is universally found in ancient sources for example paulus alexandrinus says of cadent houses stars ed i e planets found in these zoidia ed i e houses

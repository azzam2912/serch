in its usual form it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need on average to guess it correctly the strength of a password is a function of length complexity and unpredictability using strong passwords lowers overall risk of a security breach but strong passwords do not replace the need for other effective security controls the effectiveness of a password of a given strength is strongly determined by the design and implementation of the factors knowledge ownership inherence the first factor is the main focus in this article the rate at which an attacker can submit guessed passwords to the system is a key factor in determining system security some systems impose a time out of several seconds after a small number e g three of failed password entry attempts in the absence of other vulnerabilities such systems can be effectively secured with relatively simple passwords however the system must store information about the user passwords in some form and if that information is stolen say by breaching system security the user passwords can be at risk in 2019 the united kingdom s ncsc analysed public databases of breached accounts to

the substrates for these processes are various compounds in the organism s diet or growth media not all organisms are able to synthesize all amino acids for example humans can only synthesize 11 of the 20 standard amino acids a k a non essential amino acid and in time of accelerated growth histidine can be considered an essential amino acid of the basic set of twenty amino acids not counting selenocysteine humans cannot synthesize eight in addition the amino acids arginine cysteine glycine glutamine histidine proline serine and tyrosine are considered conditionally essential meaning they are not normally required in the diet but must be supplied exogenously to specific populations that do not synthesize it in adequate amounts for example enough arginine is synthesized by the urea cycle to meet the needs of an adult but perhaps not those of a growing child amino acids that must be obtained from the diet are called essential amino acids nonessential amino acids are produced in the body the pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids are quite simple glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of ketoglutarate to glutamate a transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids at

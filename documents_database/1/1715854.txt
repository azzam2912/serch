it is constructed from pieces of gold sheet in a gammadion shape embedded within layers of silica when irradiated with light from a laser the gold pieces rotate the functioning is explained by the quantum concept of the plasmon this type of nanomotor is much smaller than other types and its operation can be controlled by varying the frequency of the incident light a working demonstration model has been produced by researchers with the lawrence berkeley national laboratory and the university of california berkeley likely further developments include improving strength and flexibility and identifying lower cost materials applications envisaged include unwinding the dna of living cells and efficiently making use of solar energy the increased demands in microtechnology and nanotechnology has been triggering the vast interests and opportunities for the developments of various micro mems and nano nems mechanical system based products one of the features of this technology is its unique ability to imitate various natural phenomena for example biomedical engineering has succeeded to replace and increase the function of damaged or diseased organs by designing the artificial ones using the nanoscale approach the science behind the nanotechnology help them to design devices used for transplantation in medicine suggesting

it can be broadly classified into being either in the upper airway or lower airway causes of upper airway obstruction include foreign body aspiration blunt laryngotracheal trauma penetrating laryngotracheal trauma tonsillar hypertrophy paralysis of the vocal cord or vocal fold acute laryngotracheitis such as viral croup bacterial tracheitis epiglottitis peritonsillar abscess pertussis retropharyngeal abscess spasmodic croup in basic and advanced life support airway obstructions are often referred to as a problems management of airways relies on both minimal invasive and invasive techniques lower airway obstruction is mainly caused by increased resistance in the bronchioles usually from a decreased radius of the bronchioles that reduces the amount of air inhaled in each breath and the oxygen that reaches the pulmonary arteries it is different from airway restriction which prevents air from diffusing into the pulmonary arteries because of some kind of blockage in the lungs diseases that cause lower airway obstruction are termed obstructive lung diseases lower airway obstruction can be measured using spirometry a decreased fev1 fvc ratio versus the normal of about 80 is indicative of an airway obstruction as the normal amount of air can no longer be exhaled in the first second of expiration an airway restriction

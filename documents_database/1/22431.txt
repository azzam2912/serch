hence it is also the time taken for the sun to return to the same position with respect to the fixed stars after apparently travelling once around the ecliptic it equals for the j2000 0 epoch the sidereal year differs from the tropical year the period of time required for the ecliptic longitude of the sun to increase 360 degrees due to the precession of the equinoxes the sidereal year is 20 min 24 5 s longer than the mean tropical year at j2000 0 before the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes by hipparchus in the hellenistic period the difference between sidereal and tropical year was unknown for naked eye observation the shift of the constellations relative to the equinoxes only becomes apparent over centuries or ages and pre modern calendars such as hesiod s works and days would give the times of the year for sowing harvest and so on by reference to the first visibility of stars effectively using the sidereal year the south and southeast asian solar new year based on indic influences is traditionally reckoned by the sun s entry into aries and thus the sidereal year but is also supposed to align with

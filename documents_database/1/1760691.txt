examples of terrestrial crabs are found in the families gecarcinidae and gecarcinucidae as well as in selected genera from other families such as sesarma although the term land crab is often used to mean solely the family gecarcinidae no clear distinction is made between terrestrial semiterrestrial and aquatic crabs rather a continuum of terrestriality is displayed among the true crabs although most land adapted crabs must still return to water to release their eggs some species of terrestrial crabs can be found many kilometres from the sea but have to complete annual migrations to the sea for example following the indian ocean monsoon the christmas island red crab gecarcoidea natalis migrates forming a living carpet of crabs the crabs can travel up to in a day and up to in total only a few land crabs including certain geosesarma species have direct development the mother carries the eggs until they have become tiny fully developed crabs and these do not need access to water to breed many crabs belonging to the family potamidae which contains mostly freshwater crabs have developed a semiterrestrial for instance the genus nanhaipotamon to terrestrial life history and are sometimes independent of fresh water for reproduction

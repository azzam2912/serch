after formation the volcanic field was split by a fault in the san andreas fault zone and over the last 23 million years the two halves of the volcano have moved about 195 miles 314 kilometers apart the correlation of the two portions now called the pinnacles and neenach volcanic formations is significant this correlation has become a classic example of plate tectonics for the scientific community ten rock types with nearly identical field petrographic and chemical characteristics are present in each formation in essentially the same stratigraphic order this provides ample evidence for the correlation and interpreted movement along the san andreas fault the volcano formed 23 million years ago during tectonic subduction of the oceanic juan de fuca plate beneath the continental north american plate a process often associated with volcanic eruptions near the plate boundaries subsequent complex geophysical mechanisms caused a segment of the juan de fuca plate to fuse to the eastern edge of the adjoining pacific plate ending subduction and initiating horizontal shear movement between the plates with the pacific plate moving northwesterly and the north american plate moving in the opposite southeast direction this transform movement began approximately 20 million years ago and the

this case is of no interest and will be omitted here simple examples translation surfaces are popular in descriptive geometry and architecture because they can be modelled easily in differential geometry minimal surfaces are represented by translation surfaces or as midchord surfaces s below the translation surfaces as defined here should not be confused with the translation surfaces in complex geometry for two space curves formula 15 and formula 16 with formula 17 the translation surface formula 18 can be represented by and contains the origin obviously this definition is symmetric regarding the curves formula 3 and formula 5 therefore both curves are called generatrices one generatrix any point formula 22 of the surface is contained in a shifted copy of formula 3 and formula 5 resp the tangent plane at formula 22 is generated by the tangentvectors of the generatrices at this point if these vectors are linearly independent if the precondition formula 17 is not fulfilled the surface defined by ts may not contain the origin and the curves formula 27 but in any case the surface contains shifted copies of any of the curves formula 27 as parametric curves formula 29 and formula 30 respectively the two

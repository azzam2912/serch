they are widely distributed and commonly found on decaying wood the plasmodium often appears as white frost like growth or thin watery layers on wood pillar or wall like sporangia bud from the plasmodium and develop spores that undergo multiple divisions before they release flagellated zoospores the zoospores will then pair off undergo plasmogamy and form zygotes that will later form new plasmodia the genus currently contains 4 species the most notable member is ceratiomyxa fruticulosa a slime mould found in most parts of the world other known species of ceratiomyxa are mostly found in the tropics ceratiomyxa comes from the latin word ceratus meaning waxed and the ancient greek word myxa meaning mucus ceratiomyxa was first described under the name puccinia ramose later revised to ceratiomyxa fruticulosa in 1729 by pier antonio micheli a pioneer of mycology in 1805 albertini and schweinitz described 2 more species in the genus c hydnoides and c porioides however because ceratiomyxa species can take a variety of different forms many forms first described as species are later considered synonyms this includes c hydnoideum and c porioides which are now often considered synonyms of c fruticulosa ceratiomyxa was first placed in the subclass ceratiomyxomycetidae

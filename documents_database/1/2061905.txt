it is the most basic of the calcium phosphates and has a ca p ratio of 2 making it the most phosphorus poor phosphate it is found as the mineral hilgenstockite which is formed in industrial phosphate rich slag called thomas slag this slag was used as a fertiliser due to the higher solubility of tetracalcium phosphate relative to apatite minerals tetracalcium phosphate is a component in some calcium phosphate cements that have medical applications tetracalcium phosphate cannot be prepared in aqueous solution any precipitates having the correct ca p ratio contain hydroxide ions in apatitic phases solid state reactions are used one example is as tetracalcium phosphate is metastable the molten reaction mixture has to be quenched to rapidly reduce the temperature and prevent the formation of other compounds such as ca po cao caco and ca po oh unwanted tetracalcium phosphate can be formed when metal alloy implants orthopaedic and dental are plasma spayed with hydroxyapatite tetracalcium phosphate is stable in water at room temperature for up to four weeks but at higher temperatures hydrolyses to hydroxyapatite and calcium hydroxide tetracalcium phosphate is a component used in the formation of some hydroxyapatite calcium phosphate cements that used for

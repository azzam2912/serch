the primary application of transyt 7f is signal timing design and optimization transyt 7f features genetic algorithm optimization of cycle length phasing sequence splits and offsets transyt 7f combines a detailed optimization process including genetic algorithm multi period and direct corsim optimization with a detailed macroscopic simulation model including platoon dispersion queue spillback and actuated control simulation transyt 7f is an acronym for traffic network study tool version 7f the original transyt model was developed by the transport research laboratory in the united kingdom transyt version 7 was americanized for the federal highway administration fhwa thus the 7f the transyt 7f program and the original transyt 7f manual were developed for the federal highway administration fhwa under the national signal timing optimization project nstop by the university of florida transportation research center trc transyt 7f continues to undergo further development and is currently maintained by the university of florida s mctrans center hale d k and k g courage prediction of traffic actuated phase times on arterial streets transportation research record 1811 pp 84 91 2002 showers r h development of a moment based platooning index university of florida transportation research center 1993 chen p j hand held microcomputer applications

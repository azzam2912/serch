they may be either of through fastener style for smaller trees or side mount type for larger ones one of the main features of tabs is their strength requiring fewer tree penetrations for robust fastening of a treehouse and hence less damage to a live tree a typical tab consists of a threaded metal bolt and a larger diameter collar the latter provides an extra bending strength by bearing upon the compression strength of the tree grain since treehouses are subject to frequent load reversal produced by winds tabs must be made of spring steel the bolts are able to support from between a much greater load than conventional lag bolts tabs are commonly used in conjunction with pipe brackets allowing the treehouse structure to move independently with the tree tabs are designed so a tree s added girth can further envelop it the concept of using a collar or large cylindrical object to increase shear strength in wood construction has been around for several centuries in the forms of split rings and shear plates shear plates provide a larger load carrying capacity in shear than can be otherwise achieved by a bolt alone because this idea utilized less bolts

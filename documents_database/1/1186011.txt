the dual of an impedance formula 1 is its reciprocal or algebraic inverse formula 2 for this reason the dual impedance is also called the inverse impedance another way of stating this is that the dual of formula 1 is the admittance formula 4 the dual of a network is the network whose impedances are the duals of the original impedances in the case of a black box network with multiple ports the impedance looking into each port must be the dual of the impedance of the corresponding port of the dual network this is consistent with the general notion duality of electric circuits where the voltage and current are interchanged etc since formula 5 yields formula 6 in physical units the dual is taken with respect to some nominal or characteristic impedance to do this z and z are scaled to the nominal impedance z so that z is usually taken to be a purely real number r so z is changed by a real factor of r in other words the dual circuit is qualitatively the same circuit but all the component values are scaled by r the scaling factor r has the dimensions of so the constant

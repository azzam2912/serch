it is the melting of the dna which is not induced by a promoter but purely by the superhelical also called topological nature of the dna it is based on a statistical mechanics treatment of dna made by craig j benham and richard m fye this stress induced unwinding was shown to coincide with dna promoter regions of bacterial plasmids and may direct the global response of cells to changes in their external environments by affecting which genes are transcribed the computational model itself calculates the probability profile of a given base pair sequence of dna to denature as well as the energy profile of sequence it is through this energy profile that the technique derives its name base pairs at lower energies are less stable destabilized than those of higher energies and more likely to denature stress related to the linking number specifically its twist component of the dna causes the destabilization of the double helix duplex hence stress induced duplex destabilization craig benham has also developed an online applet that calculates the sidd profile of input dna sequences it also shows the probability profile for the given base pair sequence to denature as well as counting the number

these methods include polynomial regression curve fitting linear regression least squares ordinary least squares simple linear regression linear least squares approximation theory and method of moments polynomial least squares has applications in radar trackers estimation theory signal processing statistics and econometrics two common applications of polynomial least squares methods are generating a low degree polynomial that approximates a complicated function and estimating an assumed underlying polynomial from corrupted also known as noisy observations the former is commonly used in statistics and econometrics to fit a scatter plot with a first degree polynomial that is a linear expression the latter is commonly used in target tracking in the form of kalman filtering which is effectively a recursive implementation of polynomial least squares estimating an assumed underlying deterministic polynomial can be used in econometrics as well in effect both applications produce average curves as generalizations of the common average of a set of numbers which is equivalent to zero degree polynomial least squares in the above applications the term approximate is used when no statistical measurement or observation errors are assumed as when fitting a scatter plot the term estimate derived from statistical estimation theory is used when assuming that measurements or

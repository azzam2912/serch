it was introduced in 1920 by maurice janet it was first called the janet basis by fritz schwarz in 1998 the left hand sides of such systems of equations may be considered as differential polynomials of a ring and janet s normal form as a special basis of the ideal that they generate by abuse of language this terminology will be applied both to the original system and the ideal of differential polynomials generated by the left hand sides a janet basis is the predecessor of a gr bner basis introduced by bruno buchberger for polynomial ideals in order to generate a janet basis for any given system of linear pde s a ranking of its derivatives must be provided then the corresponding janet basis is unique if a system of linear pde s is given in terms of a janet basis its differential dimension may easily be determined it is a measure for the degree of indeterminacy of its general solution in order to generate a loewy decomposition of a system of linear pde s its janet basis must be determined first any system of linear homogeneous pde s is highly non unique e g an arbitrary linear combination

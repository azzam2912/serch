the relationship of a hyperbolic angle to a hyperbola parallels the relationship of an ordinary angle to a circle the magnitude of the hyperbolic angle is the area of the corresponding sector of the hyperbola xy 1 this hyperbola is rectangular with a semi major axis of formula 1 analogous to the magnitude of a circular angle corresponding to the area of a circular sector in a circle with radius formula 1 hyperbolic angle is used as the independent variable for the hyperbolic functions sinh cosh and tanh because these functions may be premised on hyperbolic analogies to the corresponding circular trigonometric functions by regarding a hyperbolic angle as defining a hyperbolic triangle the parameter thus becomes one of the most useful in the calculus of real variables consider the rectangular hyperbola formula 3 and by convention pay particular attention to the branch formula 4 first define note that because of the role played by the natural logarithm finally extend the definition of hyperbolic angle to that subtended by any interval on the hyperbola suppose formula 12 are positive real numbers such that formula 13 and formula 14 so that formula 15 and formula 16 are points on the hyperbola

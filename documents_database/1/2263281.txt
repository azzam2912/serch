g bickley who gave the analytical solution in 1937 to the problem derived by schlichting in 1933 and the corresponding problem in axisymmetric coordinates is called as schlichting jet the solution is valid only for distances far away from the jet origin consider a steady plane emerging into the same fluid a type of submerged jets from a narrow slit which is supposed to be very small such that the fluid loses memory of the shape and size of the slit far away from the origin it remembers only the net momentum flux let the velocity be formula 1 in cartesian coordinate and the axis of the jet be formula 2 axis with origin at the orifice the flow is self similar for large reynolds number the jet is so thin that formula 3 varies much more rapidly in the transverse formula 4 direction than the streamwise formula 2 direction and can be approximated with boundary layer equations where formula 7 is the kinematic viscosity and the pressure is everywhere equal to the outside fluid pressure since the fluid is at rest far away from the center of the jet and because the flow is symmetric about formula 2 axis

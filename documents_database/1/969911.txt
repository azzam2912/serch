like other place value systems each position holds multiples of the appropriate power of the system s base but that base is negative that is to say the base is equal to for some natural number negative base systems can accommodate all the same numbers as standard place value systems but both positive and negative numbers are represented without the use of a minus sign or in computer representation a sign bit this advantage is countered by an increased complexity of arithmetic operations the need to store the information normally contained by a negative sign often results in a negative base number being one digit longer than its positive base equivalent the common names for negative base positional numeral systems are formed by prefixing nega to the name of the corresponding positive base system for example negadecimal base 10 corresponds to decimal base 10 negabinary base 2 to binary base 2 negaternary base 3 to ternary base 3 and negaquaternary base 4 to quaternary base 4 consider what is meant by the representation in the negadecimal system whose base is 10 since 10 000 2 000 200 40 3 the representation in negadecimal notation is equivalent to in decimal notation

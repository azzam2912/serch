hutchison iii is an american biochemist and microbiologist notable for his research on site directed mutagenesis and synthetic biology he is professor emeritus of microbiology and immunology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill distinguished professor at the j craig venter institute a member of the national academy of sciences and a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences hutchison graduated from yale university in 1960 with a b s degree in physics he studied for his phd at caltech working on the bacteriophage x174 while at caltech he began a long term collaboration with marshall edgell in 1968 he moved to unc chapel hill hutchison and edgell used restriction enzymes for the analysis of x174 and mammalian dna hutchison participated in the determination of the first complete sequence of a dna molecule x174 when he spent a year sabbatical at the frederick sanger s laboratory in 1975 1976 in 1971 clyde hutchison and marshall edgell showed that it is possible to produce mutants with small fragments of bacteriophage x174 and restriction nucleases hutchison later collaborated with michael smith and developed a more general method of site directed mutagenesis using a mutant oligonucleotide primer and dna

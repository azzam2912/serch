a clast is a fragment of geological detritus chunks and smaller grains of rock broken off other rocks by physical weathering geologists use the term clastic with reference to sedimentary rocks as well as to particles in sediment transport whether in suspension or as bed load and in sediment deposits clastic sedimentary rocks are rocks composed predominantly of broken pieces or clasts of older weathered and eroded rocks clastic sediments or sedimentary rocks are classified based on grain size clast and cementing material matrix composition and texture the classification factors are often useful in determining a sample s environment of deposition an example of clastic environment would be a river system in which the full range of grains being transported by the moving water consist of pieces eroded from solid rock upstream grain size varies from clay in shales and claystones through silt in siltstones sand in sandstones and gravel cobble to boulder sized fragments in conglomerates and breccias the krumbein phi scale numerically orders these terms in a logarithmic size scale siliciclastic rocks are clastic noncarbonate rocks that are composed almost exclusively of silicon either as forms of quartz or as silicates the composition of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks includes

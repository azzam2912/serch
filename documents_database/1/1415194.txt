for example a family of real numbers indexed by the set of integers is a collection of real numbers where a given function selects for each integer one real number possibly the same more formally an indexed family is a mathematical function together with its domain i and image x often the elements of the set x are referred to as making up the family in this view indexed families are interpreted as collections instead of as functions the set i is called the index set of the family and x is the indexed set definition let i and x be sets and formula 1 a surjective function such that then this establishes a family of elements in x indexed by i which is denoted by x or simply x when the index set is assumed to be known sometimes angle brackets or braces are used instead of parentheses the latter with the risk of mixing up families with sets an indexed family can be turned into a set by considering the set formula 3 that is the image of i under x since the mapping x is not required to be injective there may exist formula 4 with formula

temperate coniferous forests are found predominantly in areas with warm summers and cool winters and vary in their kinds of plant life in some needleleaf trees dominate while others are home primarily to broadleaf evergreen trees or a mix of both tree types a separate habitat type the tropical coniferous forests occurs in more tropical climates temperate coniferous forests are common in the coastal areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall or inland in drier climates or montane areas many species of trees inhabit these forests including pine cedar fir and redwood the understory also contains a wide variety of herbaceous and shrub species temperate coniferous forests sustain the highest levels of biomass in any terrestrial ecosystem and are notable for trees of massive proportions in temperate rainforest regions structurally these forests are rather simple consisting of 2 layers generally an overstory and understory however some forests may support a layer of shrubs pine forests support an herbaceous groundlayer that may be dominated by grasses and forbs that lend themselves to ecologically important wildfires in contrast the moist conditions found in temperate rain forests favor the dominance by ferns and some forbs temperate rain forests only occur

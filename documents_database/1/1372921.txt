pipeline allows users to connect and run any number of different software tools and conveniently visualize and download the results unlike other workflow processing environments pipeline does not require new tools and services to include or be built against the core pipeline libraries the pipeline environment references all data services and tools as external objects this allows the pipeline to run as a light weight middleware but at the same time restrict the scope of its applications for example the pipeline does not provide a set of internal core libraries filters and processes for rudimentary image processing e g image addition all tools necessary to complete an analysis protocol must first be built as external stand alone applications or services whose interface methods are then described in the pipeline xml language users can connect to the loni cranium server to gain quick access to a wide array of pre built software applications such as fsl afni and freesurfer already described in xml as modules and workflows pipeline allows users to create new workflow descriptions edit existing ones and share their work with others typical pipeline server installations include a suite of core resources that are available to all users with

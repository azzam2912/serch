crocodiles serve as natural hosts there is currently only one species in this genus the type species nile crocodilepox virus diseases associated with this genus include nodular skin lesions in young animals symptoms vary from a nonfatal dermatitis to more severe disease characterized by ophthalmia rhinitis resulting in asphyxia and debilitating illness with stunting and high mortality group dsdna viruses in crocodylidpoxvirus are enveloped with ovoid geometries these viruses are about 140 170 nm wide and 220 300 nm long genomes are linear around 190kb in length viral replication is cytoplasmic entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral proteins to host glycosaminoglycans gags mediates endocytosis of the virus into the host cell fusion with the plasma membrane to release the core into the host cytoplasm early phase early genes are transcribed in the cytoplasm by viral rna polymerase early expression begins at 30 minutes post infection core is completely uncoated as early expression ends viral genome is now free in the cytoplasm intermediate phase intermediate genes are expressed triggering genomic dna replication at approximately 100 minutes post infection late phase late genes are expressed from 140 min to 48 hours post infection producing all structural

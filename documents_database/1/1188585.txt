in this model the total potential energy of system is a sum of nearest neighbour pair interactions which depend not only on the distance between atoms but also on their local atomic environment a parametrized bond order function was used to describe chemical pair bonded interactions the early formulation and parametrization of rebo for carbon systems was done by tersoff in 1988 based on works of abell the tersoff s model could describe single double and triple bond energies in carbon structures such as in hydrocarbons and diamonds a significant step was taken by brenner in 1990 he extended tersoff s potential function to radical and conjugated hydrocarbon bonds by introducing two additional terms into the bond order function compared to classical first principle and semi empirical approaches the rebo model is less time consuming since only the 1st and 2nd nearest neighbour interactions were considered this advantage of computational efficiency is especially helpful for large scale atomic simulations from 1000 to 1000000 atoms in recent years the rebo model has been widely used in the studies concerning mechanical and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes despite numerous successful applications of the first generation rebo potential function its several drawbacks have

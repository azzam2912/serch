paul mceuen alex zettl marvin cohen and steven louie fuhrer joined the university of maryland college park as an assistant professor in 2000 from 2009 2012 was professor of physics and from 2009 2013 he directed the center for nanophysics and advanced materials at maryland he joined the school of physics and astronomy at monash university melbourne australia as a professor in 2013 he was the founding director of the monash centre for atomically thin materials founded 2015 fuhrer has pioneered the study of the electronic properties of 2d materials making the first quantitative measurements of the resistivity of graphene due to charged impurities defects and phonons demonstrating the intrinsic conductivity of graphene at room temperature is higher than any other material he demonstrated the first atomically thin mos transistors and made the first measurements of the minimum conductivity and electron phonon scattering in topological insulator bise in 2017 he demonstrated that the topological material trisodium bismuthide nabi can be manufactured to be as electronically smooth as the highest quality graphene based alternative while maintaining graphene s high electron mobility fuhrer has published 136 papers cited over 17 000 times for an h index of 41 nine of fuhrer s

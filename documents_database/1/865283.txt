however unlike other t cells iels do not need priming upon encountering antigens they immediately release cytokines and cause killing of infected target cells in the gi tract they are components of gut associated lymphoid tissue galt based on expression of either an t cell receptor tcr or a tcr iel t cells can be divide into two major groups in mice both groups are retained in almost equal proportions in humans the majority of iels are alpha beta t cells 15 of iels are gamma delta t cells and thus represent a minor component of human iels however iels significantly increase under certain conditions such as celiac disease the majority of iels 80 are cd3 and over 75 of these also express cd8 iels can be divide into two major subsets based on their cd8 coreceptor expression one subset of iels typically express activation marker cd8 and some iels express cd8 marker cd8 promotes tcr activation whereas cd8 suppresses tcr signals in both humans and mice iels express higher levels of cd103 activation marker cd69 granzyme b and perforin cytolytic granules cd25 expression is lower in comparison with effector memory t cells induced iels tcr cd8 are generated from

it can be described as setting fire to the borders of an image region to yield descriptors such as the region s skeleton or medial axis harry blum introduced the concept in 1967 a region s skeleton can be a useful descriptor because it describes things such as the symmetry of the region as well as subparts depressions and protrusions it also provides a way of relating the interior of a region to the shape of the boundary in the grassfire transform the skeleton forms at the points in the region where the fires meet in the literature this is described as the locus of meeting waveforms another advantage of using the outcome of the grassfire transform as a descriptor is that it is invertible assuming information about when the medial axis or skeleton is created by meeting waveforms is kept then the skeleton can be restored by radiating outward the algorithm below is a simple two pass method for computing the manhattan distance from the border of a region of course there are several other algorithms for performing the grassfire transform below is the result of this transform it is important to note that the most intense lines make

the lumps hang down from the upper layer into the lower layer and typically form with fairly equal spacing these features form during soft sediment deformation shortly after sediment burial before the sediments lithify they can be created when a denser layer of sediment is deposited on top of a less dense sediment this arrangement is gravitationally unstable which encourages formation of a rayleigh taylor instability if the sediment becomes liquefied for instance by an imposed earthquake shock once the sediments can flow the instability creates the hanging lobes and knobs of the load casts as plumes of the denser sediment descend into the less dense layer load casts are a common kind of sole marking the expression load cast sometimes also called a load structure refers to a load the denser layer sinking into its underlying less dense cast mold related to load casts are flame structures load waves and anticrests extreme developments of load casts are pseudo nodules and ball and pillow structures in these extreme cases the hanging lobe becomes almost or completely detached from the overlying bed resulting in apparently isolated masses of the overlying material floating in the lower bed load casts were scientifically reported

apoptosis inducing factor is a flavoprotein it also acts as an nadh oxidase another aif function is to regulate the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane upon apoptosis normally it is found behind the outer membrane of the mitochondria and is therefore secluded from the nucleus however when the mitochondrion is damaged it moves to the cytosol and to the nucleus inactivation of aif leads to resistance of embryonic stem cells to death following the withdrawal of growth factors indicating that it is involved in apoptosis apoptosis inducing factor aif is a protein that triggers chromatin condensation and dna fragmentation in a cell in order to induce programmed cell death the mitochondrial aif protein was found to be a caspase independent death effector that can allow independent nuclei to undergo apoptotic changes the process triggering apoptosis starts when the mitochondria releases aif which exits through the mitochondrial membrane enters the cytosol and finally ends up in the cell nucleus where it signals the cell to condense its chromosomes and fragment its dna molecules in order to prepare for cell death recently researchers have discovered that aif s activity is dependent upon the type of cell the apoptotic insult and its dna

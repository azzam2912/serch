for example if a regular continued fraction is given by then the successive complete quotients are given by from the definition given above we can immediately deduce that or equivalently denoting the successive convergents of the regular continued fraction x a a a by a a b a b as explained more fully in the article fundamental recurrence formulas it can be shown that for all k 0 this result can be better understood by recalling that the successive convergents of an infinite regular continued fraction approach the value x in a sort of zig zag pattern so that when k is even we have a b semiconvergent consider the set of linear fractional transformations lfts defined by where a b c and d are integers and ad bc 1 since this set of lfts contains an identity element 0 x 1 and since it is closed under composition of functions and every member of the set has an inverse in the set these lfts form a group the group operation being composition of functions gl 2 z we can define an equivalence relation on the set of real numbers by means of this group of linear fractional transformations we

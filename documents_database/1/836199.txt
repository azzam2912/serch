it was driven by ricardo rosset and rookie toranosuke takagi this was tyrrell s last year in f1 as ken tyrrell had sold the team to british american racing prior to the first race indeed tyrrell left the team soon afterwards in anger after rosset was chosen to drive alongside takagi rather than tyrrell driver jos verstappen the team had a v10 engine and a reasonable chassis but the season was seen as a holding year before bar took over in the team was also disadvantaged by having an over eager rookie in takagi who nevertheless showed flashes of potential and rosset who proved to be too slow the team was unclassified in the 11th constructors championship with no points but behind minardi due to the italian team having a better finishing record the two tyrrells raced by takagi and rosset are currently owned by dutchman frits van eerd he races the cars in the euroboss series the design of the 026 also formed the basis for paul stoddart s fleet of 2 seat f1 cars constructed during his time as the owner of the minardi team results in bold indicate pole position

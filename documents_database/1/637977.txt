it is a quantization explanation involving quantum mechanics originally stipulated in 1997 and further republished in 2004 by francesco calogero that suggests the classical stochastic background field to which edward nelson attributes quantum mechanical behavior in his theory of stochastic quantization is a fluctuating space time and that there are further mathematical relations between the involved quantities the hypothesis itself suggests that if the angular momentum associated with a stochastic tremor with spatial coherence provides an action purported by that motion within the order of magnitude of planck s constant then the order of magnitude of the associated angular momentum has the same value calogero himself suggests that these findings originally based on the simplified model of the universe are affected and essentially unaffected by the possible presence in the mass of the universe of a large component made up of particles much lighter than nucleons essentially the relation explained by calogero can be expressed with the formulas furthermore where despite its common description it has been noted that the conjecture is not entirely defined within the realms of nelson s stochastic mechanics but can also be thought of as a means of inquiring into the statistical effects of interaction

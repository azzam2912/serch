it is often stated that fe is the most stable nucleus but only because fe has the lowest mass per nucleon not binding energy per nucleon of all nuclides the lower mass per nucleon of fe is possible because fe has 26 56 46 43 protons while ni has only 28 62 45 16 protons and the larger fraction of lighter protons in fe lowers its mean mass per nucleon ratio despite having a slightly higher binding energy in a way that has no effect on its binding energy the high binding energy of nickel isotopes in general makes nickel an end product of many nuclear reactions including neutron capture reactions throughout the universe and accounts for the high relative abundance of nickel although most of the nickel in space and thus produced by supernova explosions is nickel 58 the most common isotope and nickel 60 the second most with the other stable isotopes nickel 61 nickel 62 and nickel 64 being quite rare this suggests that most nickel is produced in supernovas in the r process of neutron capture from nickel 56 immediately after the core collapse with any nickel 56 that escapes the supernova explosion rapidly decaying to

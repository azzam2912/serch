they are found in soil as well as marine and fresh water habitats where they function as parasites and decomposers rhizophydiales are parasites of a range of organisms including invertebrates other chytrids and algae and they may have a role in natural control of aquatic populations especially phytoplankton one member rhizophydium graminis is a parasite of wheat roots but causes no extensive damage to the plant the only documented cases of a chytrid parasitizing vertebrates are batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and batrachochytrium salamandrivorans members of this order they are highly destructive pathogens of frogs and salamanders respectively the majority of the described saprotrophic species of this order are biodegraders of pollen with only a few growing on keratin chitin and cellulose the transformational role of the rhizophydiales in aquatic food webs is little studied but recently more recognized their thalli bodies consist of two parts an absorptive branching rhizoidal system that contains no nuclei and a multinucleate sporangium that ranges in shape from spherical to oval to pear shaped and to multi lobed the rhizoids attach the thallus to a substrate food source and absorbs nutrients when the thallus is fully grown the sporangium releases numerous unwalled uninucleate zoospores each bearing a

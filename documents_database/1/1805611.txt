proteins in this entry are type iii secretion system effectors they are named differently in different species and in yersinia has been designated yopr yersinia outer protein r which is encoded by the ysch yersinia secretion h gene this yop protein is unusual in that it is released to the extracellular environment rather than injected directly into the target cell as are most yop proteins a hallmark of yersinia type iii machines is the presence of needles extending from the bacterial surface needles perform two functions firstly as a channel to export effectors into the immune cells and secondly as a sensor in summary yopr may play a role in the regulation of type iii secretion it is important to note however that the precise function of the yopr domain remains to be elucidated but yopr is thought to be involved in with yscf which develops needles there are two different hypotheses for this the first explanation is that yopr is possibly controlling the secretion of yscf which impacts the assembly of type iii machines alternatively it is thought that yopr directly polymerizes yscf this explanation is thought to be less likely since yopr does not associated with purified needles

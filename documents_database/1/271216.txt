they were used in power applications to convert alternating current to direct current in devices such as radios and battery chargers westinghouse electric was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers since the late 1920s under the trade name westector now used as a trade name for an overcurrent trip device by westinghouse nuclear in some countries the term metal rectifier is applied to all such devices in others the term metal rectifier normally refers to copper oxide types and selenium rectifier to selenium iron types metal rectifiers consist of washer like discs of different metals either copper with an oxide layer to provide the rectification or steel plated with selenium interspersed with aluminium discs which were often of a larger size to provide cooling the principle of operation of a metal rectifier is related to modern semiconductor rectifiers schottky diodes and p n diodes but somewhat more complex both selenium and copper oxide are semiconductors in practice doped by impurities during manufacture when they are deposited on metals it would be expected that the result is a simple metal semiconductor junction and that the rectification would be a result of a schottky barrier however this is not always the case

the term serves as an umbrella term for a variety of processes such as frost shattering frost wedging and cryofracturing the process may act on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales from minutes to years and from dislodging mineral grains to fracturing boulders it is most pronounced in high altitude and high latitude areas and is especially associated with alpine periglacial subpolar maritime and polar climates but may occur anywhere at sub freezing temperatures between 3 and 8 c if water is present certain frost susceptible soils expand or heave upon freezing as a result of water migrating via capillary action to grow ice lenses near the freezing front this same phenomenon occurs within pore spaces of rocks the ice accumulations grow larger as they attract liquid water from the surrounding pores the ice crystal growth weakens the rocks which in time break up it is caused by the expansion of ice when water freezes putting considerable stress on the walls of containment this is actually a very common process in all humid temperate areas where there is exposed rock especially porous rocks like sandstone sand can often be found just under the faces of exposed sandstone where

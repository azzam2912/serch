of the seven original species it contained only the type antrodiella semisupina remains in the genus most of the original species have since been transferred to flaviporus antrodiella was traditionally placed in the family phanerochaetaceae until molecular studies were used to determine a more appropriate classification in the steccherinaceae the genus is a wastebasket taxon containing species that share common macroscopic and microscopic characteristics but are not necessarily related the fruitbodies of antrodiella fungi are either crust like to effused reflexed stretched out on the substrate but with edges curled up to form cap like structures in form they have a waxy and soft fresh texture that becomes dense and hard and often semitranslucent when dry if it is present the cap is narrow and light coloured smooth to scrupose rough with very small hard points the pore surface is light ochraceous to straw coloured when dry with small pores and the tubes the same colour as the pore surface the context is white to pale straw coloured antrodiella has a dimitic hyphal system containing both generative and skeletal hyphae the generative hyphae have clamps the skeletal hyphae are typically narrow hyaline and thick walled to solid although they are

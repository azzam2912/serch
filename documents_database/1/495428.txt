the movement began within the benedictine order at cluny abbey founded in 910 by william i duke of aquitaine 875 918 the reforms were largely carried out by saint odo c 878 942 and spread throughout france burgundy provence auvergne poitou into england the english benedictine reform and through much of italy and spain in the early 10th century western monasticism which had flourished several centuries earlier with st benedict of nursia was experiencing a severe decline due to unstable political and social conditions resulting from the nearly continuous viking raids widespread poverty and especially the dependence of abbeys on the local nobles who controlled all that belonged to the territories under their jurisdiction the impetus for the reforms lay in abuses thought to be a result of secular interference in the monasteries and of the church s tight integration with the feudal and manorial systems since a benedictine monastery required land it needed the patronage of a local lord however the lord would often demand rights and assert prerogatives that interfered with the operation of the monastery patrons normally retained a proprietary interest and expected to install their kinsmen as abbots local aristocrats often established churches monasteries and convents

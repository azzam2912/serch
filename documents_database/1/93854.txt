developed by tecmo it was the first sports video game that was licensed by both the national football league and the national football league players association thus allowing the game to use both the names and attributes of real nfl teams and real nfl players prior games used the real teams or the real players but not both simultaneously although the game was released in late 1991 all team rosters and player attributes were based on the prior 1990 91 nfl season which meant that no rookies taken in the 1991 nfl draft and no player team changes executed before the start of the 1991 season were added the original game utilized the 1991 nfl schedule only therefore playing multiple seasons with alternate schedules was not possible the game was a major success resulting in several follow ups for newer systems and although more than 25 years old it has maintained an extensive cult following after the initial success of the nes version of tecmo bowl in 1989 tecmo followed up with the release of tecmo super bowl in 1991 in both north america and japan the original nes version of tecmo bowl was licensed by the national football league

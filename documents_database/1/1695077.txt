it has several unusual properties arising from conway s discovery that it has a norm zero weyl vector in particular it is closely related to the leech lattice and has the conway group co1 at the top of its automorphism group write r for the m n dimensional vector space r with the inner product of a a and b b given by the lattice ii is given by all vectors a a in r such that either all the a are integers or they are all integers plus 1 2 and their sum is even the lattice ii is isomorphic to h where and the two summands are orthogonal so we can write vectors of ii as m n mz nw with in and m n integers where m n has norm 2 mn to give explicitly the isomorphism let formula 1 and formula 2 so that the subspace formula 3 generated by formula 4 and formula 5 is the 2 dimensional even lorentzian lattice then formula 6 is isomorphic to formula 7 and we recover one of the definitions of conway showed that the roots norm 2 vectors having inner product 1 with w 0 0 1 are

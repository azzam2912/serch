this method of analysing the elemental composition of a sample is most often used on space missions which require low weight small size and minimal power consumption other methods e g mass spectrometry are faster and do not require the use of radioactive materials but require larger equipment with less modest power requirements a variation is the alpha proton x ray spectrometer such as on the pathfinder mission which also detects protons over the years several modified versions of this type of instrument such as aps without x ray spectrometer or apxs have been flown surveyor 5 7 mars pathfinder mars 96 mars exploration rover phobos mars science laboratory and the philae comet lander aps apxs devices will be included on several upcoming missions including the chandrayaan 2 lunar rover several forms of radiation are used in apxs they include alpha particles protons and x rays alpha particles protons and x rays are emitted during the radioactive decay of unstable atoms a common source of alpha particles is curium 244 it emits particles with an energy of 5 8 mev x rays of 14 and 18 kev are emitted in the decay of plutonium 240 the mars exploration rovers athena

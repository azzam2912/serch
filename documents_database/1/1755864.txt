il28b has recently been renamed ifnl3 as its official gene symbol this gene encodes a cytokine distantly related to type i interferons and the il 10 family this gene interleukin 28a il28a and interleukin 29 il29 are three closely related cytokine genes that form a cytokine gene cluster on a chromosomal region mapped to 19q13 expression of the cytokines encoded by the three genes can be induced by viral infection all three cytokines have been shown to interact with a heterodimeric class ii cytokine receptor that consists of interleukin 10 receptor beta il10rb and interleukin 28 receptor alpha il28ra provided by refseq jul 2008 in individuals with chronic hepatitis c hcv the presence of specific polymorphisms rs12979860 near the il28b gene has been associated with an increased response in treatment for the condition with interferon and ribavirin this polymorphisim was found to be associated with another nearby interferon called as ifnl4 and hence has a potential role in hcv clearance the same polymorphisms were also demonstrated at higher frequencies in individuals infected with hepatitis c who cleared the infection spontaneously compared to those that developed chronic hepatitis from the condition a functional variant that determines the production of an antiviral

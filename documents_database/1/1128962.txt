coumestrol was first identified as a compound with estrogenic properties by e m bickoff in ladino clover and alfalfa in 1957 it has garnered research interest because of its estrogenic activity and prevalence in some foods including soybeans brussels sprouts spinach and a variety of legumes the highest concentrations of coumestrol are found in clover kala chana a type of chick pea and alfalfa sprouts coumestrol is a phytoestrogen mimicking the biological activity of estrogens phytoestrogens are able to pass through cell membranes due to their low molecular weight and stable structure and they are able to interact with the enzymes and receptors of cells coumestrol binds to the er and er with similar affinity to that of estradiol 94 and 185 of the relative binding affinity of estradiol at the er and er respectively although the estrogenic activity of coumestrol at both receptors is much less than that of estradiol in any case coumestrol has estrogenic activity that is 30 to 100 times greater than that of isoflavones the chemical shape of coumestrol orients its two hydroxy groups in the same position as the two hydroxy groups in estradiol allowing it to inhibit the activity of aromatase and 3

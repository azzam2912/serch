the exact delimitation and the internal systematics are a matter of debate for long this group was used as a wastebin taxon to hold any fireflies with insufficiently resolved relationships regardless they are very diverse even as a good monophyletic group containing flashing and continuous glow fireflies from the holarctic and some tropical forms too the ancestral lampyrinae probably had no or very primitive light signals in any case several modern lineages have returned to the pheromone communication of their ancestors independently it seems the cyphonocerinae were once contained herein but they are well distinct the psilocladinae though seem to be a de facto junior synonym of the tribe photinini but this requires further study the amydetinae are a former subfamily that is nowadays largely but not completely contained herein too the tribe pleotomini seems to be a specialized lineage of lampyrini and is here included therein while the photinini seem to comprise two rather distinct lineages one of which might warrant separation as tribe phosphaenini meanwhile the cratomorphini could just be an assemblage of unrelated ancient lampyrinae and altogether invalid as a tribe with these changes and uncertainties several genera are of very badly resolved position in this group

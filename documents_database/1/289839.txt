in addition to lowering the detection efficiency dead times can have other effects such as creating possible exploits in quantum cryptography the total dead time of a detection system is usually due to the contributions of the intrinsic dead time of the detector for example the ion drift time in a gaseous ionization detector of the analog front end for example the shaping time of a spectroscopy amplifier and of the data acquisition the conversion time of the analog to digital converters and the readout and storage times the intrinsic dead time of a detector is often due to its physical characteristics for example a spark chamber is dead until the potential between the plates recovers above a high enough value in other cases the detector after a first event is still live and does produce a signal for the successive event but the signal is such that the detector readout is unable to discriminate and separate them resulting in an event loss or in a so called pile up event where for example a possibly partial sum of the deposited energies from the two events is recorded instead in some cases this can be minimised by an appropriate design

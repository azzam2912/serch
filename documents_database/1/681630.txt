this is a very broad definition and can refer to many different structures any thin layer of organic tissue can be called a lamella and there is a wide array of functions an individual layer can serve for example an intercellular lipid lamella is formed when lamellar disks fuse together to form a lamellar sheet it is believed that these disks are formed from vesicles giving the lamellar sheet a lipid bilayer that plays a role in water diffusion another instance of cellular lamellae can be seen in chloroplasts thylakoid membranes are actually a system of lamellar membranes working together and are differentiated into different lamellar domains this lamellar system allows plants to convert sunlight into energy chloroplasts are characterized by a system of membranes embedded in a hydrophobic proteinaceous matrix or stroma the basic unit of the membrane system is a flattened single vesicle called the thylakoid thylakoids stack into grana all the thylakoids of a granum are connected with each other and the grana are connected by intergranal lamellae it is placed between the two primary cell walls of two plant cells and made up of intracellular matrix the lamella comprises a mixture of polygalacturons d galacturonic acid

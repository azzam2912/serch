these axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of metamathematical investigations including research into fundamental questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete the need to formalize arithmetic was not well appreciated until the work of hermann grassmann who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the successor operation and induction in 1881 charles sanders peirce provided an axiomatization of natural number arithmetic in 1888 richard dedekind proposed another axiomatization of natural number arithmetic and in 1889 peano published a simplified version of them as a collection of axioms in his book the principles of arithmetic presented by a new method the peano axioms contain three types of statements the first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set of natural numbers the next four are general statements about equality in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the peano axioms but rather as axioms of the underlying logic the next three axioms are first order statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation the ninth final axiom is a second order statement of the principle

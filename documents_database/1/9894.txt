electrons emitted in this manner can be called photoelectrons this phenomenon is commonly studied in electronic physics and in fields of chemistry such as quantum chemistry and electrochemistry according to classical electromagnetic theory the photoelectric effect can be attributed to the transfer of energy from the light to an electron from this perspective an alteration in the intensity of light induces changes in the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the metal according to this theory a sufficiently dim light is expected to show a time lag between the initial shining of its light and the subsequent emission of an electron but the experimental results did not correlate with either of the two predictions made by classical theory instead experiments showed that electrons are dislodged only by the impingement of light when it reached or exceeded a threshold frequency below that threshold no electrons are emitted from the material regardless of the light intensity or the length of time of exposure to the light because a low frequency beam at a high intensity could not build up the energy required to produce photoelectrons like it would have if light s energy were continuous like a wave einstein proposed that

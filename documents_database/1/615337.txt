the reason for this album release on the same day is that the band was unhappy with their former label virgin records not allowing them to participate in the compilation project they were preparing so they retaliated by re recording a selection of their signature tunes and releasing this new album on the same day in a similar fashion the redux versions of the songs undercut the price of the originals on itunes resulting in greater sales for the redux versions nine of the 13 songs that appear here are also on the virgin compilation since these songs were re recorded there are some subtle differences scattered throughout such as changed lyrics or different instrument fills knowing this a true fan could reasonably argue that this is in fact not a compilation but a new studio recording even though the songs had all been recorded and released prior to this album except for something you ain t got which would appear a few months later in the year on their greenland release

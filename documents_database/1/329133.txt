if used the purpose and behavior of a gpio is defined and implemented by the designer of higher assembly level circuitry the circuit board designer in the case of integrated circuit gpios or system integrator in the case of board level gpios integrated circuit ic gpios are implemented in a variety of ways some ics provide gpios as a primary function whereas others include gpios as a convenient accessory to some other primary function examples of the former include the intel 8255 which interfaces 24 gpios to a parallel bus and various gpio expander ics which interface gpios to serial buses such as i c and smbus an example of the latter is the realtek alc260 ic which provides eight gpios in addition to its primary function of audio codec microcontroller ics typically include gpios depending on the application a microcontroller s gpios may comprise its primary interface to external circuitry or they may be just one type of i o used among several such as analog i o counter timer and serial communication in some ics particularly microcontrollers a gpio pin may be capable of alternate functions often in such cases it is necessary to configure the pin to

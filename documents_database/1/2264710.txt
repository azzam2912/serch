the high altitude bad terrain and weather make geologic investigations in the region difficult the volcanic field partly covers the kangtuo formation the bamaoqiongzong yongbohu and qiangbaqian fields featured hawaiian eruptions that have formed lava flows later erosion has reduced these to flat topped conical hills and table mountains other volcanic centres are the cones of heiguotou kushuihuan beishan and yuyiehu in addition the kekexili caldera is considered part of the field this caldera has a diameter of a volcano named debussey is supposedly also located there bamaoqiongzong covers a surface area of it forms a peak with column jointed rocks at its top two craters lie on this peak one wide and deep on the northeastern side with a breach southeast and another less well preserved one on the southeastern side it is surrounded by lava domes and lava sheets originally likely over thick now they reach only several yongbohu features five vents the principal one has a height of one has the shape of a dragon and another one is conical quiangbaqian covers a surface of and features lava tube and fissure fed lava flows as well as one volcano these volcanics are also known as yulinshan formation

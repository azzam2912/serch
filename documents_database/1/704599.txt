in essence the demand for say a factor of production by a firm is dependent on the demand by consumers for the product produced by the firm the term was first introduced by alfred marshall in his principles of economics in 1890 this is similar to the concept of joint demand or complementary goods the quantity consumed of one of them depending positively on the quantity of the other consumed producers have a derived demand for employees the employees themselves do not appear in the employer s utility function rather they enable employers to profit by fulfilling the demand by consumers for their product thus the demand for labour is a derived demand from the demand for goods and services for example if the demand for a good such as wheat increases then this leads to an increase in the demand for labour as well as demand for other factors of production such as fertilizer for another example demand for steel leads to derived demand for steel workers as steel workers are necessary for the production of steel as the demand for steel increases so does its price the increase in price means manufacturers of steel can gain more in

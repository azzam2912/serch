first published by hans berliner in 1979 it is related to the a search algorithm the algorithm stores intervals for nodes of the tree as opposed to single point valued estimates then leaf nodes of the tree can be searched until one of the top level nodes has an interval which is clearly best leaf nodes of a b tree are given evaluations that are intervals rather than single numbers the interval is supposed to contain the true value of that node if all intervals attached to leaf nodes satisfy this property then b will identify an optimal path to the goal state to back up the intervals within the tree a parent s upper bound is set to the maximum of the upper bounds of the children a parent s lower bound is set to the maximum of the lower bound of the children note that different children might supply these bounds b systematically expands nodes in order to create separation which occurs when the lower bound of a direct child of the root is at least as large as the upper bound of any other direct child of the root a tree that creates separation at the root

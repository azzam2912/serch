the satellite contains an experimental computer that is ten times more powerful than any current esa spacecraft the ops sat mission has the very clear objective to break the cycle of has never flown will never fly in the area of satellite control it is going to be the first cubesat operated directly by esa ops sat will provide an in orbit test bed environment for the deployment of different experiments to test new protocols new algorithms and new techniques the satellite is being designed to be robust and no single point of failure should exist therefore it shall be always possible to recover the spacecraft if something goes wrong with one of the software experiments the robustness of the basic satellite itself will allow esa flight control teams to upload and try out new innovative control software submitted by experimenters in the experimental platform the satellite will run the software experiments one innovative concept is the deployment of space software in the form of apps this is a new concept that esa wants to test in space and it is different from previous esa satellites this concept is enabled by the nanosat mo framework nmf and allows ops sat

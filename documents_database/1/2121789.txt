these aggregates of particles form for a variety of reasons from chemical gradients to magnetic and ultrasonic fields self propelled enzyme motors and synthetic nanomotors also exhibit clustering effects in the form of chemotaxis chemotaxis is a form of collective motion of biological or non biological particles toward a fuel source or away from a threat as observed experimentally in enzyme diffusion and also synthetic chemotaxis or phototaxis in addition to irreversible schooling self propelled particles also display reversible collective motion such as predator prey behavior and oscillatory clustering and dispersion this clustering behavior has been observed for self propelled janus particles either platinum coated gold particles or carbon coated silica beads and for magnetically or ultrasonically powered particles clustering has also been observed for colloidal particles composed of either an embedded hematite cube or slowly diffusing metal ions clustering also occurs in enzyme molecule diffusion in all these experiments the motion of particles takes place on a two dimensional surface and clustering is seen for area fractions as low as 10 for such low area fractions the clusters have a finite mean size while at larger area fractions 30 or higher a complete phase separation has been reported the

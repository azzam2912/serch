this data structure supports codice 1 in formula 1 in big o notation amortized time and codice 2 in constant time but does not support deletion athanasios tsakalidis used bb trees with the same performance bounds that supports deletion in formula 1 and improved insertion and deletion performance to formula 3 amortized time with indirection dietz and daniel sleator published an improvement to worst case constant time in 1987 michael bender richard cole and jack zito published significantly simplified alternatives in 2004 bender fineman gilbert kopelowitz and montes also published a deamortized solution in 2017 efficient data structures for order maintenance have applications in many areas including data structure persistence graph algorithms and fault tolerant data structures a problem related to the order maintenance problem is the list labeling problem in which instead of the codice 6 operation the solution must maintain an assignment of labels from a universe of integers formula 4 to the elements of the set such that x precedes y in the total order if and only if x is assigned a lesser label than y it must also support an operation codice 7 returning the label of any node x note that codice 2 can

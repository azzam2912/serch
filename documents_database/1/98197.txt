although initially developed by mathematician hermann minkowski for maxwell s equations of electromagnetism the mathematical structure of minkowski spacetime was shown to be an immediate consequence of the postulates of special relativity minkowski space is closely associated with einstein s theory of special relativity and is the most common mathematical structure on which special relativity is formulated while the individual components in euclidean space and time may differ due to length contraction and time dilation in minkowski spacetime all frames of reference will agree on the total distance in spacetime between events because it treats time differently than it treats the 3 spatial dimensions minkowski space differs from four dimensional euclidean space in 3 dimensional euclidean space e g simply space in galilean relativity the isometry group the maps preserving the regular euclidean distance is the euclidean group it is generated by rotations reflections and translations when time is amended as a fourth dimension the further transformations of translations in time and galilean boosts are added and the group of all these transformations is called the galilean group all galilean transformations preserve the 3 dimensional euclidean distance this distance is purely spatial time differences are separately preserved as well this

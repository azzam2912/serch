the design started life in parallel with the larger type 21 as a private venture inexpensive robust two seat training glider intended for the air training corps the aircraft borrowed design elements from several predecessors including an enlarged wing from the t 8 kirby tutor and a fuselage reminiscent of the early falcons with cabane struts in front of the rear cockpit which sat in front of the narrow cabane structure under the centre section as well as an additional cockpit in the nose flying with the t 20 began in 1944 with no reported problems the prototype languished at sutton bank gliding club emerging only to fly the occasional illegal soaring flight the pilots that flew the t 20 all praising its handling no production order was forthcoming however during the intensive carrier operations of the war it had been noticed that there were many accidents as aircraft neared the round down the aft edge of the flight deck on their approach to land on to investigate this phenomenon the admiralty authorised a research program to establish airflow patterns over the round down on large aircraft carriers using a suitable glider towed behind a carrier using a small winch

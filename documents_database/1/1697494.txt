plp enzymes exist in their resting state as a schiff base the aldehyde group of plp forming a linkage with the epsilon amino group of an active site lysine residue on the enzyme the alpha amino group of the substrate displaces the lysine epsilon amino group in the process forming a new aldimine with the substrate this aldimine is the common central intermediate for all plp catalysed reactions enzymatic and non enzymatic plp is the active form of vitamin b6 pyridoxine or pyridoxal plp is a versatile catalyst acting as a coenzyme in a multitude of reactions including decarboxylation deamination and transamination a number of pyridoxal dependent enzymes involved in the metabolism of cysteine homocysteine and methionine have been shown to be evolutionary related these enzymes are tetrameric proteins of about 400 amino acid residues each monomer has an active site which however requires the n terminal of another monomer to be completed salt bridges to phosphate and entrance way the phosphopyridoxyl group is attached to a lysine residue located in the central section of these enzymes and is stabilised by stacking interactions with a tyrosine residue above it there are five different structurally related types of plp enzymes members

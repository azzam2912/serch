the name derives from the behavior of some species of cuckoo where the cuckoo chick pushes the other eggs or young out of the nest when it hatches analogously inserting a new key into a cuckoo hashing table may push an older key to a different location in the table cuckoo hashing was first described by rasmus pagh and flemming friche rodler in 2001 cuckoo hashing is a form of open addressing in which each non empty cell of a hash table contains a key or key value pair a hash function is used to determine the location for each key and its presence in the table or the value associated with it can be found by examining that cell of the table however open addressing suffers from collisions which happen when more than one key is mapped to the same cell the basic idea of cuckoo hashing is to resolve collisions by using two hash functions instead of only one this provides two possible locations in the hash table for each key in one of the commonly used variants of the algorithm the hash table is split into two smaller tables of equal size and each hash function provides

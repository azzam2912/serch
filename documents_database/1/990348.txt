alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms the protein encoded by this gene is phosphorylated by zap70 syk protein tyrosine kinases following activation of the t cell antigen receptor tcr signal transduction pathway this transmembrane protein localizes to lipid rafts also known as glycosphingolipid enriched microdomains or gems and acts as a docking site for sh2 domain containing proteins upon phosphorylation this protein recruits multiple adaptor proteins and downstream signaling molecules into multimolecular signaling complexes located near the site of tcr engagement lat was described in the early 1990s as a phosphoprotein of 36 38 kda pp 36 38 rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following tcr ligation cloning of the gene revealed that the protein product is a type iii leaderless transmembrane protein of 262 aminoacids long form or 233 aminoacids short form in humans 242 aminoacids in mouse and 241 aminoacids in rat the linker for activation of t cells has been shown to interact with

they are found mainly incised into the terrain of the martian southern highlands and are typically though not always of noachian age approximately four billion years old the individual valleys are typically less than 5 kilometers wide though they may extend for up to hundreds or even thousands of kilometers across the martian surface the form distribution and implied evolution of the valley networks are of great importance for what they may tell us about the history of liquid water on the martian surface and hence mars climate history some authors have argued that the properties of the networks demand that a hydrological cycle must have been active on ancient mars though this remains contentious objections chiefly arise from repeated results from models of martian paleoclimate suggesting high enough temperatures and pressures to sustain liquid water on the surface have not ever been possible on mars the advent of very high resolution images of the surface from the hirise themis and context ctx satellite cameras as well as the mars orbital laser altimeter mola digital terrain models have drastically improved our understanding of the networks in the last decade the valleys of the networks are typically narrow drainage density of

informally it is a probability space consisting of an interval and or a finite or countable number of atoms the theory of standard probability spaces was started by von neumann in 1932 and shaped by vladimir rokhlin in 1940 rokhlin showed that the unit interval endowed with the lebesgue measure has important advantages over general probability spaces yet can be effectively substituted for many of these in probability theory the dimension of the unit interval is not an obstacle as was clear already to norbert wiener he constructed the wiener process also called brownian motion in the form of a measurable map from the unit interval to the space of continuous functions the theory of standard probability spaces was started by von neumann in 1932 and shaped by vladimir rokhlin in 1940 for modernized presentations see and nowadays standard probability spaces may be and often are treated in the framework of descriptive set theory via standard borel spaces see for example this approach is based on the isomorphism theorem for standard borel spaces an alternate approach of rokhlin based on measure theory neglects null sets in contrast to descriptive set theory standard probability spaces are used routinely in ergodic theory

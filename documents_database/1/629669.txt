the book is an exegesis and commentary on the qur an originally it was named mafatih al ghayb however it was nicknamed as tafsir al kabir at 32 volumes it is larger than the 28 volume tafsir of at tabari named jami al bayan it is not unusual for contemporary works to use it as a reference mufti muhammad taqi usmani has written in uloomu l qur an an approach to the qur anic sciences just as tafsir ibn kathir is the most concise and matchless exegesis from a narrative point of view so also there is no parallel to tafsir kabir in relation to sciences of reason some people have passed a funny remark on this exegesis such as is written in al itqan in it there is everything except exegesis but in the opinion of mufti muhammad taqi usmani if this comment applies to any tafsir it describes tafsir al tawahir by tantawi but the fact is that this remark is cruelly unjust to this book because this book has no equal in interpretation of the meanings of the qur an the prominent features of this book are in short tafseer al kabeer is a very concise exegesis

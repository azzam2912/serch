this colourless volatile liquid with an odour resembling ether is produced on a large scale industrially its major application is its use for the production of polyether polyols for use in making polyurethane plastics it is a chiral epoxide although it is commonly used as a racemic mixture this compound is sometimes called 1 2 propylene oxide to distinguish it from its isomer 1 3 propylene oxide better known as oxetane industrial production of propylene oxide starts from propylene two general approaches are employed one involving hydrochlorination and the other involving oxidation in 2005 about half of the world production was through chlorohydrin technology and one half via oxidation routes the latter approach is growing in importance the traditional route proceeds via the conversion of propene to propylene chlorohydrin according to the following simplified scheme the mixture of 1 chloro 2 propanol and 2 chloro 1 propanol is then dehydrochlorinated for example lime calcium hydroxide is often used to absorb the hcl the other general route to propylene oxide involves oxidation of propylene with an organic peroxide the reaction follows this stoichiometry the process is practiced with four hydroperoxides in principle this process produces only water was a side product

he is a professor of polymer science and technology at the national graphene institute of the university of manchester young was educated at st john s college cambridge where he received his master of arts and doctor of philosophy degrees young has published over 330 research papers he is known for research on the relationships between the structure and mechanical properties of polymers and composites a particular focus of his work has been the study of how materials such as carbon fibres and spider silk deform at the molecular level he has also studied carbon fibre composites carbon nanotubes and the deformation of graphene a one atom thick sheet of carbon in his research young made a novel use of raman spectroscopy in this technique laser light is shone onto a material and the wavelength and intensity of the resulting scattered light is measured and analysed the changes in the light relate to changes in bond length between the atoms of the molecules in the material when the material is deformed young received the 2011 leslie holliday prize and the 2012 swinburne medal from the institute of materials minerals and mining and delivered the swinburne lecture in 2013 he was

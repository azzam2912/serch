woodpecker symphony is an instrumental composed by brian wilson for american rock band the beach boys released in 1967 as the third track on the group s album smiley smile the composition derives from a piece recorded by wilson several months earlier but left unreleased due to his paranoia wilson said of this version that was sort of a song about a cold winter scene we tried to paint a picture of winter and then spring late summer and then broke into winter we used the woody woodpecker theme because it was descriptive to us of spring and summer biographer david leaf noted its bizarre woodpecking percussion the use of a squeeze box that emulates the iconic woody woodpecker laugh and wordless vocals by the beach boys musicologist daniel harrison described the track along with other smiley smile tracks as a kind of protomiminal rock music and that the lack of formal or harmonic development makes the listener focus upon other quaities such as instrumentation timbre and reverberation a concentrated listening effort thus goes quickly to subtle details writer richard goldstein characterized fall breaks and back to winter as a precursor to the sound of experimental pop band animal collective

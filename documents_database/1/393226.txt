it was added to the new south wales state heritage register on 2 april 1999 the bethungra spiral is proposed to be bypassed by the inland railway project on a new alignment with an easier grade by 2025 the original line was graded at 1 in 40 for sydney bound trains which imposed a severe limitation on train loads and also caused congestion as bank engines were attached when the line was duplicated in the 1940s an 8 9 kilometre spiral deviation was built the spiral makes use of local geography in the shape of a convenient hill which the uphill line spirals around and has short tunnels the spiral increased the distance travelled by uphill northbound trains by about two kilometres downhill southbound trains continue to use the original line the ruling gradient of the new uphill line is 1 in 66 due to the extensive blasting required to create 27 metre cuttings through granite the line suffered from rockfalls with twelve significant falls between 1960 and 1987 in january 1994 the spiral line closed for a four month rebuild which saw the cuttings widened and regraded to benched 55 degree slopes as part of the one nation project

clupi was designed to acquire high resolution close up images in colour of soils outcrops rocks drill fines and drill core samples as well as and the search for potential biosignature structures and patterns this camera assembly is part of the science payload on board the european space agency rosalind franklin rover tasked to search for biosignatures and biomarkers on mars the rover is planned to be launched in july 2020 and land on mars in march 2021 the clupi instrument is being developed by a swiss french consortium supported by the swiss space office and the french space agency cnes its principal investigator is jean luc josset from the space exploration institute neuchatel in switzerland frances westall and beda hofmann are co pis the science team includes scientists from canada europe and russia especially for biosignature recognition instrument field tests started in 2009 with preliminary clupi systems tested during several arctic winters clupi will be mounted on the movable rover s drill box and it will acquire high resolution close up images in colour of the texture structure and morphology of rocks and soil the resolution will be similar to what geologists would obtain by using a hand held

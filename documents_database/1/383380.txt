it is a common unit process used in refineries and is also used in petrochemical plants natural gas processing plants and other industries processes within oil refineries or chemical processing plants that remove hydrogen sulfide are referred to as sweetening processes because the odor of the processed products is improved by the absence of hydrogen sulfide an alternative to the use of amines involves membrane technology however membrane separation is less attractive due to the relatively high capital and operating costs as well as other technical factors many different amines are used in gas treating the most commonly used amines in industrial plants are the alkanolamines dea mea and mdea these amines are also used in many oil refineries to remove sour gases from liquid hydrocarbons such as liquified petroleum gas lpg gases containing or both and are commonly referred to as sour gases or acid gases in the hydrocarbon processing industries the chemistry involved in the amine treating of such gases varies somewhat with the particular amine being used for one of the more common amines monoethanolamine mea denoted as rnh the chemistry may be expressed as a typical amine gas treating process the girbotol process as shown in

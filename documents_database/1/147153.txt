it involves the calculation of the mean after discarding given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end and typically discarding an equal amount of both this number of points to be discarded is usually given as a percentage of the total number of points but may also be given as a fixed number of points for most statistical applications 5 to 25 percent of the ends are discarded the 25 trimmed mean when the lowest 25 and the highest 25 are discarded is known as the interquartile mean for example given a set of 8 points trimming by 12 5 would discard the minimum and maximum value in the sample the smallest and largest values and would compute the mean of the remaining 6 points the median can be regarded as a fully truncated mean and is most robust as with other trimmed estimators the main advantage of the trimmed mean is robustness and higher efficiency for mixed distributions and heavy tailed distribution like the cauchy distribution at the cost of lower efficiency for some other less heavily tailed distributions such as the normal distribution for intermediate distributions the differences between the efficiency of

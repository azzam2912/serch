anti capitalists in the strict sense of the word are those who wish to replace capitalism with another type of economic system socialism advocates public or direct worker ownership and administration of the means of production and allocation of resources and a society characterized by equal access to resources for all individuals with an egalitarian method of compensation socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalizations that require costly corrective regulatory measures they also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit such as high pressure advertisement thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates rather than for consumption even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need they argue that making money or accumulation of capital does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand private ownership imposes constraints on planning leading to inaccessible economic decisions that result in immoral production unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis

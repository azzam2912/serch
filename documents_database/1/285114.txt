difficulty in determining the age of many of the structures and doubts about the exogenic origins of several of them leave some geologists skeptical of this hypothesis as of 2016 only two of the structures crooked creek 320 80 ma and decaturville earth impact database there is evidence that at least some of them such as hicks dome are volcanic in origin they are associated with faults and fractured rock and are accompanied by igneous rocks and mineral deposits hicks dome is a structural dome which has its central devonian core displaced upward some in relation to the surrounding strata the dome has small associated igneous dikes around its flanks interest in the possibility of serial impacts on earth was piqued by observations of comet shoemaker levy 9 impacting on jupiter in 1994 it is estimated however that the likelihood of such an event on earth is vanishingly small because the earth s weaker gravitational field is much less able than jupiter s to pull a speeding object close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces however evidence of serial impacts on the moon can be seen in several chains of craters

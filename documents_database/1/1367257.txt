cortical injury may lead to loss of thermal sensation or the ability to discriminate pain an aura involving thermal and painful sensations is a phenomenon known to precede the onset of an epileptic seizure or focal seizure another type of seizure called a sensory jacksonian seizure involves an abnormal localizable cutaneous sensation but does not have apparent stimulus this sensation may progress along a limb or to adjacent cutaneous body areas reflecting abnormal neuronal firing in the postcentral gyrus where an epileptic discharge is propagated these episodes in which patients are consciously aware during a seizure have been useful for identifying problems associated with the somatosensory cortex patients can describe the nature of the seizure and how they feel during it the absence of proprioception or two point tactile discrimination on one side of the body suggests injury to the contralateral side of the primary somatosensory cortex however depending on the extent of the injury damage can range in loss of proprioception of an individual limb or the entire body a deficit known as cortical astereognosis of the receptive type describes an inability to make use of tactile sensory information for identifying objects placed in the hand for example if

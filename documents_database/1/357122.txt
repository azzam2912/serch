it is a cubic yttrium aluminum oxide phase with other examples being yalo in a hexagonal or an orthorhombic perovskite like form and the monoclinic yalo yag like garnet and sapphire has no uses as a laser medium when pure however after being doped with an appropriate ion yag is commonly used as a host material in various solid state lasers rare earth elements such as neodymium and erbium can be doped into yag as active laser ions yielding and lasers respectively cerium doped yag ce yag is used as a phosphor in cathode ray tubes and white light emitting diodes and as a scintillator yag for a period was used in jewelry as a diamond and other gemstone simulant colored variants and their doping elements include green chromium blue cobalt red manganese yellow titanium purple neodymium pink and orange as faceted gems they are valued as synthetics for their clarity durability high refractive index and dispersion the critical angle of yag is 33 degrees yag cuts like natural garnet with polishing being performed with alumina or diamond 50 000 or 100 000 grit on common polishing laps yag has low heat sensitivity as a synthetic gemstone yag has numerous

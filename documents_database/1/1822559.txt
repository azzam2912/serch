it is the brightest member of the coma cluster and is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4 80 although listed as a suspected variable star there is no photometric evidence of it being variable in luminosity however the radial velocity was found to be variable as announced by w w campbell in 1910 the first orbital solution was published by vinter hansen in the 1940s it is a double lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 396 5 days and an eccentricity of 0 566 this system consists of two stars an evolved f type giant star and a smaller but higher temperature a type main sequence star griffin and griffin 2011 suggested that the secondary component may have begun its evolution away from the main sequence and instead assigned it a luminosity class of iv the primary designated component a has 2 6 times the mass of the sun and has expanded to 8 9 times the sun s radius it is radiating 56 times the sun s luminosity from its enlarged photosphere at an effective temperature of 5 300 k its companion component b has double the sun s mass and

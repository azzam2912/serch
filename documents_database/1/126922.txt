over 1300 species have been described in north america alone insects in this family commonly are called tachinid flies or simply tachinids as far as is known they all are protelean parasitoids or occasionally parasites of arthropods usually other insects the family is known from many habitats in all zoogeographical regions and is especially diverse in south america reproductive strategies vary greatly between tachinid species largely but not always clearly according to their respective life cycles this means that they tend to be generalists rather than specialists comparatively few are restricted to a single host species so there is little tendency towards the close co evolution one finds in the adaptations of many specialist species to their hosts such as are typical of protelean parasitoids among the hymenoptera larvae maggots of most members of this family are parasitoids developing inside a living host ultimately killing it in contrast a few are parasitic not generally killing the host tachinid larvae feed on the host tissues either after having been injected into the host by the parent or penetrating the host from outside various species have different modes of oviposition and of host invasion typically tachinid larvae are endoparasites internal parasites of

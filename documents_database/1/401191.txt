it was originally introduced in 1971 as coldness function by one of the proponents of the rational thermodynamics school of thought based on earlier proposals for a reciprocal temperature function thermodynamic beta has units reciprocal to that of energy in si units formula 2 in non thermal units it can also be measured in byte per joule or more conveniently gigabyte per nanojoule 1 k is equivalent to about 13 062 gigabytes per nanojoule at room temperature 300k thermodynamic beta is essentially the connection between the information theory and statistical mechanics interpretation of a physical system through its entropy and the thermodynamics associated with its energy it expresses the response of entropy to an increase in energy if a system is challenged with a small amount of energy then describes the amount the system will randomize via the statistical definition of temperature as a function of entropy the coldness function can be calculated in the microcanonical ensemble from the formula i e the partial derivative of the entropy with respect to the energy at constant volume and particle number though completely equivalent in conceptual content to temperature is generally considered a more fundamental quantity than temperature owing to the phenomenon

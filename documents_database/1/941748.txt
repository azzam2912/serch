this protein is a determinant for the ok blood group system basigin has been shown to be an essential receptor on red blood cells for the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum basigin is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with a structure related to the putative primordial form of the family as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily play fundamental roles in intercellular recognition involved in various immunologic phenomena differentiation and development basigin is thought also to play a role in intercellular recognition miyauchi et al 1991 kanekura et al 1991 it has a variety of functions in addition to its metalloproteinase inducing ability basigin also regulates several distinct functions such as spermatogenesis expression of the monocarboxylate transporter and the responsiveness of lymphocytes basigin is a type i integral membrane receptor that has many ligands including the cyclophilin cyp proteins cyp a and cyp b and certain integrins it is expressed by many cell types including epithelial cells endothelial cells and leukocytes the human basigin protein contains 269 amino acids that form two heavily glycosylated c2 type immunoglobulin like domains at the n terminal extracellular portion a second form of basigin has also been characterized that contains one additional immunoglobulin like

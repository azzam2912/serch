the idea is to provide highly available ethernet switched rings commonly used in metro ethernet to replace legacy tdm based transport protection fiber rings other implementations include ethernet protection switching ring epsr by allied telesis which enhanced eaps to provide full protected transport of ip triple play services voice video and internet traffic for xdsl fttx deployments eaps epsr is the most widely deployed ethernet protection switching solution deployed with major multi vendor inter operability support the eaps epsr are the basis of the itu g 8032 ethernet protection recommendation a ring is formed by configuring a domain each domain has a single master node and many transit nodes each node will have a primary port and a secondary port both known to be able to send control traffic to the master node under normal operation the secondary port on the master is blocked for all protected vlans when there is a link down situation the devices that detect the failure send a control message to the master and the master will then unblock the secondary port and instruct the transits to flush their forwarding databases the next packets sent by the network can then be flooded and learned out

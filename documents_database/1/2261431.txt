whether there is a polynomial formula 18 such that for every formula 1 state 2nfa there exists a formula 18 state 2dfa the problem was raised by sakoda and sipser who compared it to the p vs np problem in the computational complexity theory berman and lingas discovered a formal relation between this problem and the l vs nl open problem this relation was further elaborated by kapoutsis given a binary regularity preserving operation on languages formula 21 and a family of automata x dfa nfa etc the state complexity of formula 21 is an integer function formula 23 such that analogous definition applies for operations with any number of arguments the first results on state complexity of operations for dfas were published by maslov and by yu zhuang and salomaa holzer and kutrib pioneered the state complexity of operations on nfa the known results for basic operations are listed below if language formula 28 requires m states and language formula 29 requires n states how many states formula 30 requires how many states formula 39 requires if language l requires n states then how many states its complement requires how many states formula 55 requires state complexity of finite

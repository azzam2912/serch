more generally unimodality means there is only a single highest value somehow defined of some mathematical object in statistics a unimodal probability distribution or unimodal distribution is a probability distribution which has a single peak the term mode in this context refers to any peak of the distribution not just to the strict definition of mode which is usual in statistics if there is a single mode the distribution function is called unimodal if it has more modes it is bimodal 2 trimodal 3 etc or in general multimodal figure 1 illustrates normal distributions which are unimodal other examples of unimodal distributions include cauchy distribution student s t distribution chi squared distribution and exponential distribution among discrete distributions the binomial distribution and poisson distribution can be seen as unimodal though for some parameters they can have two adjacent values with the same probability figure 2 and figure 3 illustrate bimodal distributions other definitions of unimodality in distribution functions also exist in continuous distributions unimodality can be defined through the behavior of the cumulative distribution function cdf if the cdf is convex for x concave for x m then the distribution is unimodal m being the mode note that under this

it uses two reservoirs produced by damming the pulangi river to supply water to a run of the river hydroelectric power plant the power plant is capable of generating of power construction began in 1982 the first two generators became operational in december 1985 with the last generator being commissioned in 1986 the upper pondage reservoir located at diverts water into a power channel which parallels the river until it reaches the lower reservoir surge pool at to the south at the lower reservoir water is fed to each of the three francis turbine generators via a penstock the pulangi iv power plant provides 23 of the hydroelectric power generated on mindanao since operation the reservoirs associated with the power plant have received an estimated of sediment annually of the reservoir s combined active capacity has been filled with silt the siltation rate was almost 1 meter annually and caused the dam s reservoir to work at 50 capacity the unexpected siltation threatens safe operation of the dams and power generation in addition to drastically shortening the predicted operational lifespan of the dam at first the minimum and maximum water levels were raised and in 2007 dredging work was performed

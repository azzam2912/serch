bouchard jr johnson bouchard 2005 they developed the model by analyzing gf gc theory john carroll s three stratum theory and vernon s verbal perceptual model the g vpr model is a four stratum model johnson and bouchard made comparisons between gf gc three stratum and verbal spatial model they found that vernon s verbal perceptual model got better modeling fit results than the other two but still did not fit very well then based on the verbal spatial model johnson and bouchard began by adding a memory factor labeled content memory to distinguish it from the memory factor in the fluid crystallized model they also made some extra changes to improve model fit according to results from cab comprehensive ability battery they added moved loadings to adjust new model then it came into a new visual perceptual memory model however johnson and bouchard found that i solation of the tests involved resulted in identification of an additional third stratum factor for image rotation which also eliminated the contradictory cross loadings therefore finally the new model was named as verbal perceptual rotation vpr model after johnson and bouchard concluded this g vpr intelligence structure model they compared the model fit

code i41 was an astronomical survey using a wide field survey camera designed to search for optical transient and variable sources such as variable stars supernovae asteroids and comets the project completed commissioning in summer 2009 and continued until december 2012 it has since been succeeded by the intermediate palomar transient factory iptf which itself transitioned to the zwicky transient facility in 2017 18 all three surveys are registered at the mpc under the same observatory code for their astrometric observations the fully automated system included an automated realtime data reduction pipeline a dedicated photometric follow up telescope and a full archive of all detected astronomical sources the survey was performed with a 12k 8k 7 8 square degree ccd array camera re engineered for the 1 2 meter samuel oschin telescope at palomar observatory the survey camera achieved first light on 13 december 2008 ptf was a collaboration of caltech lbnl infrared processing and analysis center berkeley lcogt oxford columbia and the weizmann institute the project was led by shrinivas kulkarni at caltech as of 2018 he leads the zwicky transient facility image subtraction for near realtime transient detection was performed at lbnl efforts to continue to observe interesting

the word pelagic is derived the pelagic zone can be thought of in terms of an imaginary cylinder or water column that goes from the surface of the sea almost to the bottom conditions in the water column change with distance from the surface depth e g the pressure increases the temperature and the amount of light decreases the salinity the amount of disolved oxygen and micronutrients e g fe mg ca all change depending on the depth the water column rather like the earth s atmosphere may be divided into different layers the pelagic zone occupies 1 330 million km 320 million mi with a mean depth of and maximum depth of fish that live in the pelagic zone are called pelagic fish pelagic life decreases with increasing depth in addition to the above changes life is affected by the submarine topography which is called bathymetry in deep water the pelagic zone is sometimes called the open ocean zone and can be contrasted with water that is near the coast or on the continental shelf in other contexts coastal water not near the bottom is still said to be in the pelagic zone the pelagic zone can be contrasted

they apply the latest scientific knowledge and technologies to the design of buildings architectural engineering as a relatively new licensed profession emerged in the 20th century as a result of the rapid technological developments architectural engineers are at the forefront of two major historical opportunities that today s world is immersed in 1 that of rapidly advancing computer technology and 2 the parallel revolution arising from the need to create a sustainable planet distinguished from architecture as an art of design architectural engineering is the art and science of engineering and construction as practiced in respect of buildings structural engineering involves the analysis and design of the built environment buildings bridges equipment supports towers and walls those concentrating on buildings are sometimes informally referred to as building engineers structural engineers require expertise in strength of materials structural analysis and in predicting structural load such as from weight of the building occupants and contents and extreme events such as wind rain ice and seismic design of structures which is referred to as earthquake engineering architectural engineers sometimes incorporate structural as one aspect of their designs the structural discipline when practiced as a specialty works closely with architects and other engineering specialists

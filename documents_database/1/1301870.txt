a canonical form is a labeled graph canon g that is isomorphic to g such that every graph that is isomorphic to g has the same canonical form as g thus from a solution to the graph canonization problem one could also solve the problem of graph isomorphism to test whether two graphs g and h are isomorphic compute their canonical forms canon g and canon h and test whether these two canonical forms are identical the canonical form of a graph is an example of a complete graph invariant every two isomorphic graphs have the same canonical form and every two non isomorphic graphs have different canonical forms conversely every complete invariant of graphs may be used to construct a canonical form the vertex set of an n vertex graph may be identified with the integers from 1 to n and using such an identification a canonical form of a graph may also be described as a permutation of its vertices canonical forms of a graph are also called canonical labelings and graph canonization is also sometimes known as graph canonicalization clearly the graph canonization problem is at least as computationally hard as the graph isomorphism problem in fact

for many applications such a task requires the definition of a solid of revolution shape that experiences minimal resistance to rapid motion through such a fluid medium which consists of elastic particles in all of the following nose cone shape equations is the overall length of the nose cone and is the radius of the base of the nose cone is the radius at any point as varies from at the tip of the nose cone to the equations define the two dimensional profile of the nose shape the full body of revolution of the nose cone is formed by rotating the profile around the centerline while the equations describe the perfect shape practical nose cones are often blunted or truncated for manufacturing or aerodynamic reasons a very common nose cone shape is a simple cone this shape is often chosen for its ease of manufacture more optimal streamlined shapes described below are often much more difficult to create the sides of a conic profile are straight lines so the diameter equation is simply cones are sometimes defined by their half angle in practical applications a conical nose is often blunted by capping it with a segment of a sphere

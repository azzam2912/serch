it flows down the east coast of africa from 27 s to 40 s it is narrow swift and strong it is suggested that it is the largest western boundary current in the world ocean with an estimated net transport of 70 sverdrups sv millions m s as western boundary currents at comparable latitudes transport less brazil current 16 2 sv gulf stream 34 sv kuroshio 42 sv the sources of the agulhas current are the east madagascar current 25 sv the mozambique current 5 sv and a recirculated part of the south west indian subgyre south of madagascar 35 sv the net transport of the agulhas current is estimated as 100 sv the flow of the agulhas current is directed by the topography the current follows the continental shelf from maputo to the tip of the agulhas bank 250 km south of cape agulhas here the momentum of the current overcomes the vorticity balance holding the current to the topography and the current leaves the shelf the current reaches its maximum transport near the agulhas bank where it ranges between 95 136 sv the core of the current is defined as where the surface velocities reaches which gives the

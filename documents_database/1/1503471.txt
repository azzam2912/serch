the research in this area is coordinated by a task group of the international water association iwa activated sludge models are used in scientific research to study biological processes in hypothetical systems they can also be applied on full scale wastewater treatment plants for optimisation when carefully calibrated with reference data for sludge production and nutrients in the effluent around 1983 a task group of the international association on water quality one of the associations that formed iwa was formed they started creating on a generalised framework for mathematical models that could be used to model activated sludge for nitrogen removal one of the main goals was to develop a model of which the complexity was as low as possible and simple to represent though still able to accurately predict the biological processes after four years the first iawq model named asm1 was ready and incorporated a basic model for cod removal oxygen demand bacterial growth and biomass degradation an activated sludge model consists of before work on asm1 started in 1983 there was already some 15 years of experience in activated sludge modelling although every research group that worked on mathematical systems of activated sludge created its own model

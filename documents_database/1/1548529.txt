today neutrino oscillation or change of one type of neutrino into another is an experimentally verified fact however the details of the underlying theory responsible for these processes remain an open issue and an active field of study the conventional model of neutrino oscillations assumes that neutrinos are massive which provides a successful description of a wide variety of experiments however there are a few oscillation signals that cannot be accommodated within this model which motivates the study of other descriptions in a theory with lorentz violation neutrinos can oscillate with and without masses and many other novel effects described below appear the generalization of the theory by incorporating lorentz violation has shown to provide alternative scenarios to explain all the established experimental data through the construction of global models conventional lorentz preserving descriptions of neutrinos explain the phenomenon of oscillations by endowing these particles with mass however if lorentz violation occurs oscillations could be due to other mechanisms the general framework for lorentz violation is called the standard model extension sme the neutrino sector of the sme provides a description of how lorentz and cpt violation would affect neutrino propagation interactions and oscillations this neutrino framework first appeared in

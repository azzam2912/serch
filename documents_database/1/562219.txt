this curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen specifically the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation s and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood p and is determined by what is called hemoglobin affinity for oxygen that is how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules into the fluid that surrounds it hemoglobin hb is the primary vehicle for transporting oxygen in the blood each hemoglobin molecule has the capacity to carry four oxygen molecules these molecules of oxygen bind to the iron of the heme prosthetic group when hemoglobin has no bound oxygen nor bound carbon dioxide it has the unbound conformation shape the binding of the first oxygen molecule induces change in the shape of the hemoglobin that increases its ability to bind to the other three oxygen molecules in the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide the ph of the blood changes this causes another change in the shape of hemoglobin which increases it s ability to bind carbon dioxide and decreases it ability to bind oxygen with the loss of the first oxygen molecule and the binding of the first carbon dioxide molecule yet another change in shape occurs

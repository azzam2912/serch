as opposed to constant bitrate cbr vbr files vary the amount of output data per time segment vbr allows a higher bitrate and therefore more storage space to be allocated to the more complex segments of media files while less space is allocated to less complex segments the average of these rates can be calculated to produce an average bitrate for the file mp3 wma and aac audio files can optionally be encoded in vbr while opus vorbis are always in vbr variable bit rate encoding is also commonly used on mpeg 2 video mpeg 4 part 2 video xvid divx etc mpeg 4 part 10 h 264 video theora dirac and other video compression formats additionally variable rate encoding is inherent in lossless compression schemes such as flac and apple lossless the advantages of vbr are that it produces a better quality to space ratio compared to a cbr file of the same data the bits available are used more flexibly to encode the sound or video data more accurately with fewer bits used in less demanding passages and more bits used in difficult to encode passages the disadvantages are that it may take more time to encode as

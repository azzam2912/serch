palaeontologist adolf seilacher pioneered the concept of ichnofacies whereby the state of a sedimentary system at its time of deposition could be deduced by noting the trace fossils in association with one another ichnofacies can provide information about water depth salinity turbidity and energy in general traces found in shallower water are vertical those in deeper water are more horizontal and patterned this is partly because of the relative abundance of suspended food particles such as plankton in the shallower waters of the photic zone and partly because vertical burrows are more secure in the turbulent conditions of shallow water in deeper waters there is a necessary transition to sediment feeding extracting nutrients from the mud food availability hence trace type is also controlled by energy high energy environments keep food particles suspended whereas in lower energy areas food settles out evenly and burrows will tend to spread out to cover as much area as economically as possible ichnofacies have a major advantage over using body fossils to gauge the same factors body fossils can be transported but trace fossils are always in situ

the major reason for the use of superadditive sequences is the following lemma due to michael fekete lemma fekete for every superadditive sequence a n 1 the limit lim a n exists and is equal to sup a n the limit may be positive infinity for instance for the sequence a log n similarly a function f is superadditive if for all x and y in the domain of f for example formula 3 is a superadditive function for nonnegative real numbers because the square of formula 4 is always greater than or equal to the square of formula 5 plus the square of formula 6 for nonnegative real numbers formula 5 and formula 6 the analogue of fekete s lemma holds for subadditive functions as well there are extensions of fekete s lemma that do not require the definition of superadditivity above to hold for all m and n there are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of convergence to the limit whose existence is stated in fekete s lemma if some kind of both superadditivity and subadditivity is present a good exposition of this topic may be found in steele 1997 if f is a

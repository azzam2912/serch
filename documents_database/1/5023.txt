gadolinium is a silvery white metal when oxidation is removed it is only slightly malleable and is a ductile rare earth element gadolinium reacts with atmospheric oxygen or moisture slowly to form a black coating gadolinium below its curie point of is ferromagnetic with an attraction to a magnetic field higher than that of nickel above this temperature it is the most paramagnetic element it is found in nature only in an oxidized form when separated it usually has impurities of the other rare earths because of their similar chemical properties gadolinium was discovered in 1880 by jean charles de marignac who detected its oxide by using spectroscopy it is named after the mineral gadolinite one of the minerals in which gadolinium is found itself named for the chemist johan gadolin pure gadolinium was first isolated by the chemist paul emile lecoq de boisbaudran around 1886 gadolinium possesses unusual metallurgical properties to the extent that as little as 1 of gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures of iron chromium and related metals gadolinium as a metal or a salt absorbs neutrons and is therefore used sometimes for shielding in neutron radiography and in

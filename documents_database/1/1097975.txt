the basic layout includes a gas generator which produces high pressure gas that drives a turbine compressor assembly which compresses atmospheric air into a combustion chamber this mixture is then combusted before leaving the device through a nozzle and creating thrust there are many different types of air turborockets the various types generally differ in how the gas generator section of the engine functions air turborockets are often referred to as turboramjets turboramjet rockets turborocket expanders and many others as there is no consensus on which names apply to which specific concepts various sources may use the same name for two different concepts the benefit of this setup is increased specific impulse over that of a rocket for the same carried mass of propellant as a rocket motor the overall output of the air turborocket is much higher in addition it provides thrust throughout a much wider speed range than a ramjet yet is much cheaper and easier to control than a gas turbine engine the air turborocket fills a niche in terms of cost reliability ruggedness and duration of thrust between the solid fuel rocket motor and gas turbine engine for missile applications a turborocket is a type of

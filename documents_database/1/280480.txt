it uses the hydraulic equivalent of a mechanical lever and was also known as a bramah press after the inventor joseph bramah of england he invented and was issued a patent on this press in 1795 as bramah who is also known for his development of the flush toilet installed toilets he studied the existing literature on the motion of fluids and put this knowledge into the development of the press the hydraulic press depends on pascal s principle the pressure throughout a closed system is constant one part of the system is a piston acting as a pump with a modest mechanical force acting on a small cross sectional area the other part is a piston with a larger area which generates a correspondingly large mechanical force only small diameter tubing which more easily resists pressure is needed if the pump is separated from the press cylinder pascal s law pressure on a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished and acts with equal force on equal areas and at 90 degrees to the container wall pressure of fluid due to the application force f formula 1 1 resulting force f on the larger cylinder due to the pressure of the

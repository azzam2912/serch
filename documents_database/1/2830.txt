color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting photography videography publishing manufacturing astrophysics horticulture and other fields in practice color temperature is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body i e light in a range going from red to orange to yellow to white to blueish white it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of e g a green or a purple light color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvins using the symbol k a unit of measure for absolute temperature color temperatures over 5000 k are called cool colors bluish while lower color temperatures 2700 3000 k are called warm colors yellowish warm in this context is an analogy to radiated heat flux of traditional incandescent lighting rather than temperature the spectral peak of warm coloured light is closer to infrared and most natural warm coloured light sources emit significant infrared radiation the fact that warm lighting in this sense actually has a cooler color temperature often leads to confusion the color temperature of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from an ideal black body is defined as its

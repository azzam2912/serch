members of this genus are either annuals or perennials and some are popular as ornamental plants endemic to southern africa the majority of the approximately 80 species grow in south africa particularly the cape floristic region while a few extend into the namib desert the first recognised published description of heliophila appears in the second edition of species plantarum by carl linnaeus printed in 1763 he attributes his description however to nicolaas laurens burman a dutch botanist the generic name heliophila is latin but originally derived from the ancient greek words h lios meaning sun and ph los meaning dear or beloved and refers to the blooms opening in sun and closing at night or in overcast conditions a habit of many of the species within the genus in general contention abounds regarding phylogenetic relationships in the family brassicaceae in the past using morphological characters to establish tribes and genera was misleading and created dissension among systematists the classification of species within brassicaceae is gradually resolving through molecular phylogeny investigation using internal transcribed spacer its data and other new found sequencing knowledge previously there were six genera within the tribe heliophileae all endemic to southern africa heliophila cycloptychis schlechteri silicularia

it acts as a receptor agonist and nmda receptor antagonist it has no significant affinity for the opioid or opioid receptor or for the serotonin or norepinephrine transporter as an nmda receptor antagonist in vivo it is approximately twice as potent as dextromethorphan and five fold less potent than dextrorphan dextrallorphan is often used in research to block receptor sites so that receptor sites which have not been cloned yet can be studied it was hypothesized that both of these sigma receptors were opioid receptors due to their affinity for psychoactive drugs however it is now understood that they are non opioid receptors that bind to certain psychoactive drugs like dextrallorphan one example of dextrallorphan being used to mask receptor sites was seen in a study on the localization of the receptor in detergent resistant lipid raft domains it has also been used to mask receptor sites so that receptor binding characteristics in the rat liver could be determined by labeling receptor sites with h l 3 di o tolylguanidine dtg in the presence of 1 m dextrallorphan solution dextrallorphan was used in spraque dawley rats to study cerebellar purkinje neurons electrophysical responses to the drug when it was applied

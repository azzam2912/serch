it is a member of the cygnus ob2 association and a candidate luminous blue variable bd 40 4210 is heavily reddened and extinguished by the interstellar dust of the milky way and little studied it has turned out to be one of the most luminous stars of the cygnus ob2 association with an absolute magnitude of 7 66 and a bolometric luminosity more than 600 000 times that of our sun it has been assigned a b1iii spectral classification but with peculiarities including unusually shallow lines and broad emission despite the giant luminosity class the luminosity appears to be extremely high placing it on or near the s doradus instability strip occupied by quiescent luminous blue variables its brightness varies by less than 0 1 magnitudes on a timescale around 100 days bd 40 4210 is located at a projected 4 8 parsecs from the candidate luminous blue variable g79 29 0 46 and probably at a similar distance since both are assumed members of cygnus ob2 however unlike the latter which is surrounded by an extensive ring shaped nebulosity no nebula has been found around this star

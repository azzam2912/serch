substances transition between the reactants and products at equal rates meaning there is no net change reactants and products are formed at such a rate that the concentration of neither changes it is a particular example of a system in a steady state in thermodynamics a closed system is in thermodynamic equilibrium when reactions occur at such rates that the composition of the mixture does not change with time reactions do in fact occur sometimes vigorously but to such an extent that changes in composition cannot be observed equilibrium constants can be expressed in terms of the rate constants for elementary reactions in a new bottle of soda the concentration of carbon dioxide in the liquid phase has a particular value if half of the liquid is poured out and the bottle is sealed carbon dioxide will leave the liquid phase at an ever decreasing rate and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the gas phase will increase until equilibrium is reached at that point due to thermal motion a molecule of co may leave the liquid phase but within a very short time another molecule of co will pass from the gas to the liquid and vice versa

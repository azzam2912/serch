typical problem areas of interest include structural analysis heat transfer fluid flow mass transport and electromagnetic potential the analytical solution of these problems generally require the solution to boundary value problems for partial differential equations the finite element method formulation of the problem results in a system of algebraic equations the method approximates the unknown function over the domain to solve the problem it subdivides a large system into smaller simpler parts that are called finite elements the simple equations that model these finite elements are then assembled into a larger system of equations that models the entire problem fem then uses variational methods from the calculus of variations to approximate a solution by minimizing an associated error function recently the method has been successfully applied for simulating quantum effects in low dimensional systems like metallic nanoparticles carbon nanotubes quantum dots quantum wells artificial molecules and monolayer transition metal dicholcagenides studying or analyzing a phenomenon with fem is often referred to as finite element analysis fea the subdivision of a whole domain into simpler parts has several advantages a typical work out of the method involves 1 dividing the domain of the problem into a collection of subdomains with each

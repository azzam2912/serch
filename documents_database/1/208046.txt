it was discovered on 17 february 1873 by astronomer christian peters at litchfield observatory new york and named after electra an avenger in greek mythology the spectrum of 130 elektra is of the g type hence it probably has a ceres like composition spectral signatures of organic compounds have been seen on elektra s surface and it displays evidence of aqueous alteration in the late 1990s a network of astronomers worldwide gathered lightcurve data that was ultimately used to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids including 130 elektra the light curve of 130 elektra forms a double sinusoid while the shape model is elongated and the derived rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic optical observations have found two satellites of this asteroid once the orbits are known elektra s mass can be reliably found the value of 6 6 kg indicates a density of 1 3 0 3 g cm optical observations have also determined that elektra s shape is quite irregular as well as giving indications of albedo differences of 5 15 on its surface elektra has been observed to pass in front of a dozen stars since 2007 most

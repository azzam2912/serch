an admissible set is closed under formula 2 functions if formula 3 is a model of kripke platek set theory then formula 1 is an admissible ordinal in what follows formula 1 is considered to be fixed the objects of study in formula 1 recursion are subsets of formula 1 a is said to be formula 1 recursively enumerable if it is formula 9 definable over formula 10 a is recursive if both a and formula 11 its complement in formula 1 are formula 1 recursively enumerable members of formula 10 are called formula 1 finite and play a similar role to the finite numbers in classical recursion theory we say r is a reduction procedure if it is formula 1 recursively enumerable and every member of r is of the form formula 17 where h j k are all finite a is said to be recursive in b if there exist formula 18 reduction procedures such that if a is recursive in b this is written formula 21 by this definition a is recursive in formula 22 the empty set if and only if a is recursive however a being recursive in b is not equivalent to a being

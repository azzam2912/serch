it was part of the ibm 700 7000 series and was based on discrete transistors rather than the vacuum tubes of the 1950s it was the company s first transistorized stored program computer the 7070 was expected to be a common successor to at least the 650 and the 705 the 7070 was not designed to be instruction set compatible with the 650 as the latter had a second jump address in every instruction to allow optimal use of the drum something unnecessary and wasteful in a computer with random access core memory as a result a simulator was needed to run old programs the 7070 was also marketed as an ibm 705 upgrade but failed miserably due to its incompatibilities including an inability to fully represent the 705 character set forcing ibm to quickly introduce the ibm 7080 as a transistorized ibm 705 that was fully compatible the 7070 series stored data in words containing 10 decimal digits plus a sign digits were encoded using a two out of five code characters were represented by a two digit code the machine shipped with 5 000 to 9 990 words of core and the cpu speed was about 27kips a

the gene is part of a cluster of mmp genes which localize to chromosome 11q22 3 mmp 1 was the first vertebrate collagenase both purified to homogeneity as a protein and cloned as a cdna mmp 1 has an archetypal structure consisting of a pre domain a pro domain a catalytic domain a linker region and a hemopexin like domain the primary structure of mmp 1 was first published by goldberg g i et al two main nomenclatures for the primary structure are currently in use the original one from which the first amino acid starts with the signalling peptide and a second one where the first amino acid starts counting from the prodomain proenzyme nomenclature the catalytic domains of mmps share very similar characteristics having a general shape of oblate ellipsoid with a diameter of 40 despite the similarity of the catalytic domains of mmps this entry will focus only on the structural features of mmp 1 catalytic domain the catalytic domain of mmp 1 is composed of five highly twisted strands si sv three helix ha hc and a total of eight loops enclosing a total of five metal ions three ca and two zn one of which

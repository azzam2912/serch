someone who engages in this study is called a creolist creolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be creoles what calls the cline of creoleness no consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is prototypical or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause creoleness is at the heart of the controversy with john mcwhorter and mikael parkvall opposing henri wittmann 1999 and michel degraff in mcwhorter s definition creoleness is a matter of degree in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness little or no inflection little or no tone transparent derivation in mcwhorter s view less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this prototype along these lines mcwhorter defines haitian creole exhibiting all three traits as the most creole of creoles a creole like palenquero on the other hand would be less prototypical given the presence of inflection to mark plural past gerund and participle forms objections to the mcwhorter parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological parameters of creoleness can be found in languages such as manding sooninke and magoua french which

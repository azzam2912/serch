like computational chemistry or computational biology it is for particle physics both a specific branch and an interdisciplinary field relying on computer science theoretical and experimental particle physics and mathematics the main fields of computational particle physics are lattice field theory numerical computations automatic calculation of particle interaction or decay computer algebra and event generators stochastic methods particle physics played a role in the early history of the internet the world wide web was created by tim berners lee when working at cern in 1991 note this section contains an excerpt from computer algebra in particle physics by stefan weinzierl particle physics is an important field of application for computer algebra and exploits the capabilities of computer algebra systems cas this leads to valuable feed back for the development of cas looking at the history of computer algebra systems the first programs date back to the 1960s the first systems were almost entirely based on lisp list programming language lisp is an interpreted language and as the name already indicates designed for the manipulation of lists its importance for symbolic computer programs in the early days has been compared to the importance of fortran for numerical programs in the same

bitumen can also be made from waste vacuum tower bottoms produced in the process of cleaning used motor oils which are normally burned or dumped into land fills non petroleum based bitumen binders can be colored which can reduce the temperatures of road surfaces and reduce the urban heat islands because of concerns over peak oil pollution and climate change as well the oil price increases since 2003 non petroleum alternatives have become more popular this has led to the introduction of biobitumen alternatives that are more environmentally friendly and nontoxic for millions of people living in and around cities heat islands are of growing concern this phenomenon describes urban and suburban temperatures that are 1 to 6 c 2 to 10 f hotter than nearby rural areas elevated temperatures can impact communities by increasing peak energy demand air conditioning costs air pollution levels and heat related illness and mortality there are common sense measures that communities can take to reduce the negative effects of heat islands such as replacing conventional black asphalt road surfaces with the new pigmentable bitumen that gives lighter colors asphalt made with vegetable oil based binders was patented by colas sa in france in 2004

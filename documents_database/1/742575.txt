the effects of the extra copy varies greatly from individual to individual depending on the extent of the extra copy genetic background environmental factors and random chance down syndrome can occur in all human populations and analogous effects have been found in other species such as chimpanzees and mice recently researchers have been able to create transgenic mice with most of human chromosome 21 in addition to their normal chromosomes a typical human karyotype is shown here every chromosome has two copies in the bottom right there are chromosomal differences between males xy and females xx which do not concern us a typical human karyotype is designated as 46 xx or 46 xy indicating 46 chromosomes with an xx arrangement for females and 46 chromosomes with an xy arrangement for males for this article we will use females for the karyotype designation 46 xx trisomy 21 47 xy 21 is caused by a meiotic nondisjunction event a typical gamete either egg or sperm has one copy of each chromosome 23 total when it is combined with a gamete from the other parent during conception the child has 46 chromosomes however with nondisjunction a gamete is produced with an extra copy

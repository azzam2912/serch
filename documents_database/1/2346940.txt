the su 2 color quark matter adjoins the list of superconducting systems although it is a mathematical abstraction its properties are believed to be closely related to the su 3 color quark matter which exists in nature when ordinary matter is compressed at supranuclear densities above 0 5 10 nucleon cm superconducting materials are characterized by the loss of resistance and two parameters a critical temperature t and a critical magnetic field which brings the superconductor to its normal state in 1911 h kamerlingh onnes discovered the superconductivity of mercury at a temperature below 4 k later other substances with superconductivity at temperatures up to 30 k were found superconductors prevent the penetration of the external magnetic field into the sample when the magnetic field strength is less than the critical value this effect was called the meissner effect high temperature superconductivity was discovered in the 1980s of the known compounds the highest critical temperature t 135 k belongs to hgbacacuo low temperature superconductivity has found a theoretical explanation in the model of bardeen cooper and schrieffer bcs theory the physical basis of the model is the phenomenon of cooper pairing of electrons since a pair of electrons carries an

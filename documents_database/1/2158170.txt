the primary outcome being measured was myocardial infarction other acute coronary syndromes stroke heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes the study implies that patients receiving standard therapy were controlled similarly to all adults being treated for hypertension and that patients receiving intensive therapy had a lower mean sbp compared to all adults being treated for hypertension but neither conclusion is true when compared to the us national health and nutrition examination survey during the study 9361 patients were randomly assigned to either a 140 mm hg target referred to in the study as standard treatment or a 120 mm hg target intensive treatment patients were prescribed blood pressure reducing medications to reach their assigned goal unlike normal hypertension treatment once the goal was reached prescriptions were suspended until the patient was no longer at goal after being followed up for a median of 3 26 years the study showed a significantly lower rate of the primary outcome in the intensive treatment group 1 65 per year compared to the standard treatment group 2 19 per year the risk of experiencing a primary outcome myocardial infarction other acute coronary syndromes stroke heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes was 25

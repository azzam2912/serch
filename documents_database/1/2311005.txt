eis combines a narrow angle camera nac and a wide angle camera wac designed to address the reconnaissance goals both cameras operate on the visible spectrum 390 to 700 nm and make use of push broom scanners for obtaining images with spectroscopic sensors the principal investigator is elizabeth turtle the objectives of the eis instrument are the nac provides very high resolution stereo reconnaissance generating 2 km wide swaths at 0 5 m pixel scale from 50 km altitude nac observations also include near global 95 mapping of europa at 50 m pixel scale regional and high resolution stereo imaging at 1 m pixel and high phase angle observations for plume searches the nac will also perform high phase angle observations to search for potential plumes even when the spacecraft is distant from europa the wac will acquire stereo reconnaissance generating digital topographic models with 32 m spatial scale and 4 m vertical precision from 50 km altitude

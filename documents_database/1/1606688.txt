these simple groups are the only finite non abelian ones with orders not divisible by 3 originally constructed the suzuki groups as subgroups of sl f generated by certain explicit matrices ree observed that the suzuki groups were the fixed points of exceptional automorphisms of some symplectic groups of dimension 4 and used this to construct two further families of simple groups called the ree groups in the lowest case the symplectic group b 2 s its exceptional automorphism fixes the subgroup sz 2 or b 2 of order 20 constructed the suzuki groups as the symmetries of a certain ovoid in 3 dimensional projective space over a field of characteristic 2 constructed the suzuki groups as the subgroup of the symplectic group in 4 dimensions preserving a certain product on pairs of orthogonal vectors let q 2 r 2 n a non negative integer the suzuki groups sz q or b q are simple for n 1 the group sz 2 is solvable and is the frobenius group of order 20 the suzuki groups sz q have orders q q 1 q 1 these groups have orders divisible by 5 not by 3 the schur multiplier is trivial for

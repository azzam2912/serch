in these models colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top the hsv representation models the way paints of different colors mix together with the saturation dimension resembling various tints of brightly colored paint and the value dimension resembling the mixture of those paints with varying amounts of black or white paint the hsl model attempts to resemble more perceptual color models such as the natural color system ncs or munsell color system placing fully saturated colors around a circle at a lightness value of where a lightness value of 0 or 1 is fully black or white respectively hsl and hsv are both cylindrical geometries with hue their angular dimension starting at the red primary at 0 passing through the green primary at 120 and the blue primary at 240 and then wrapping back to red at 360 in each geometry the central vertical axis comprises the neutral achromatic or gray colors ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0 the bottom to white at lightness 1 or value 1 the top in both geometries the additive

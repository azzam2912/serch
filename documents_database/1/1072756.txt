mukherjee has been the first to develop and implement a class of many body methods for electronic structure which are now standard works in the field these methods collectively called multireference coupled cluster formalisms are versatile and powerful methods for predicting with quantitative accuracy the energetics and cross sections of a vast range of molecular excitations and ionization a long standing problem of guaranteeing proper scaling of energy for many electron wave functions of arbitrary complexity has also been first resolved by him he has also been the first to develop a rigorously size extensive state specific multi reference coupled cluster formalism and its perturbative counterpart which is getting increasingly recognized as a very promising methodological advance the attractive aspects of mukherjee s formalisms are compactness and high accuracy these are now accepted as pioneering and standard works in the field which has attracted wide international attention he has also developed a rigorous finite temperature non perturbative field theory to study thermodynamics of strongly interacting many body systems which is now being applied extensively to study dynamics of vibronic coupling at finite temperature mukherjee has coauthored more than 200 papers on various aspects of theoretical chemistry and edited aspects of

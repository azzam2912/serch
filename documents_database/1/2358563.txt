it is designed for devices with small amounts of ram as low as 8kb espruino was created by gordon williams in 2012 as an attempt to make microcontroller development truly multiplatform though initially not open source the espruino firmware was offered as a free download for stm32 microcontrollers it was made open source in 2013 after a successful kickstarter campaign for a development board running the software since the original espruino board there have been a number of new official development boards including the small usb thumb drive sized espruino pico the wifi equipped espruino wifi the puck js with built in bluetooth and the pixl js with a built in lc display and arduino shield compatibility in addition to the official boards espruino runs on approximately 40 other types of development boards including the esp8266 there is a large body of reference material for espruino including over 100 tutorials as well as the book making things smart which contains a selection of hardware projects that can be created with espruino based microcontrollers the first official development board was the original espruino later boards are available in a variety of form factors the original espruino was followed by the espruino

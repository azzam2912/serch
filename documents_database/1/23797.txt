it is one of many forms of luminescence light emission and is initiated by photoexcitation i e photons that excite electrons to a higher energy level in an atom hence the prefix photo following excitation various relaxation processes typically occur in which other photons are re radiated time periods between absorption and emission may vary ranging from short femtosecond regime for emission involving free carrier plasma in inorganic semiconductors up to milliseconds for phosphorescence processes in molecular systems and under special circumstances delay of emission may even span to minutes or hours observation of photoluminescence at a certain energy can be viewed as an indication that an electron populated an excited state associated with this transition energy while this is generally true in atoms and similar systems correlations and other more complex phenomena also act as sources for photoluminescence in many body systems such as semiconductors a theoretical approach to handle this is given by the semiconductor luminescence equations photoluminescence processes can be classified by various parameters such as the energy of the exciting photon with respect to the emission resonant excitation describes a situation in which photons of a particular wavelength are absorbed and equivalent photons are very rapidly

electromagnetic coils are used in electrical engineering in applications where electric currents interact with magnetic fields in devices such as electric motors generators inductors electromagnets transformers and sensor coils either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field or conversely an external time varying magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an emf voltage in the conductor a current through any conductor creates a circular magnetic field around the conductor due to ampere s law the advantage of using the coil shape is that it increases the strength of magnetic field produced by a given current the magnetic fields generated by the separate turns of wire all pass through the center of the coil and add superpose to produce a strong field there the more turns of wire the stronger the field produced conversely a changing external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire due to faraday s law of induction the induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times the direction of the magnetic field produced by a coil can be

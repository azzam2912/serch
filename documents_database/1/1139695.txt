as a miro protein isoform the protein facilitates mitochondrial transport by attaching the mitochondria to the motor adaptor complex through its key role in mitochondrial transport rhot1 is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis as well as parkinson s disease pd and cancer in mammals rhot1 is one of two miro isoforms both isoforms share a structure consisting of two ef hand motifs linking two gtp binding domains and a c terminal transmembrane domain that attaches the protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane omm the ef hand motifs serve as binding sites for the adaptor protein milton and the kinesin heavy chain these domains can also bind calcium ions and the binding results in a conformational change that dissociates the mitochondrial surface from kinesin rhot1 is a member of the rho gtpase family and one of two isoforms of the protein miro rhot1 miro1 and rhot2 miro2 compared to the rest of the rho gtpase family the miro isoforms are considered atypical due to their different regulation moreover the miro isoforms are only expressed in the mitochondria miro associates with milton trak1 2 and the motor proteins kinesin and dynein to form the mitochondrial motor adaptor complex miro functions to

it may or may not be reciprocal and occurs in both endotherms and ectotherms its most common form is huddling huddling confers higher and more constant body temperatures than solitary resting some species of ectotherms including lizards and snakes such as boa constrictors and tiger snakes increase their effective mass by clustering tightly together it is also widespread amongst gregarious endotherms such as bats and birds such as the mousebird and emperor penguin where it allows the sharing of body heat particularly among juveniles in at least one case this is not reciprocal and might be accurately described as heat stealing some male canadian red sided garter snakes engage in female mimicry by producing fake pheromones after emerging from hibernation this causes rival males to cover them in a mistaken attempt to mate and so transfer heat to them this allows those males that mimic females to become more quickly revitalized after hibernation which depends upon raising their body temperature giving them an advantage in their own attempts to mate many ectotherms exploit the heat produced by endotherms by sharing their nests and burrows for example mammal burrows are used by geckos and seabird burrows by australian tiger snakes and

this is achieved by writing brief information metadata representing the empty blocks to disk instead of the actual empty space which makes up the block using less disk space the full block size is written to disk as the actual size only when the block contains real non empty data when reading sparse files the file system transparently converts metadata representing empty blocks into real blocks filled with null bytes at runtime the application is unaware of this conversion most modern file systems support sparse files including most unix variants and ntfs apple s hfs does not provide for sparse files but in os x the virtual file system layer supports storing them in any supported file system including hfs apple file system apfs announced in june 2016 at wwdc also supports them sparse files are commonly used for disk images database snapshots log files and in scientific applications the advantage of sparse files is that storage is only allocated when actually needed disk space is saved and large files can be created even if there is insufficient free space on the file system this also reduces the time of the first write as the system doesn t have to

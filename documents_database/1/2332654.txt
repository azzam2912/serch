jerome in the desert is a 1505 oil on canvas painting by giovanni bellini now in the national gallery of art in washington little remains of the signature on the first rock in the left foreground but it has been confirmed as genuine during restoration and can be reconstructed as johannes bellinu s 1505 this is problematic since the work s general style is linked to fashions no later than 1490 whereas bellini s style of figures and landscapes had already begun to be influenced by giorgione by 1500 with the backgrounds more fused and unified in terms of atmosphere the composition makes it more analogous to his earlier works such as the c 1480 st jerome in the desert the washington work may have been a collaboration a work completed by a pupil in bellini s studio or left incomplete and only finished by bellini himself much later saint jerome is shown reading in the desert referring to his life as a hermit and as the producer of the vulgate bible a lizard a squirrel and hare appear among the rocks whilst in the distance are a ruined roman bridge and series of arches along with a walled city

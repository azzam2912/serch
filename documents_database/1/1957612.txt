araguaiaensis as a distinct species is still debated it was originally distinguished from the amazon river dolphin inia geoffrensis in january 2014 on the basis of nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial dna data as well as differences in skull morphology it generally has a wider skull it also differs from the amazon and bolivian river dolphins in the number of teeth per hemimandible 24 28 versus 25 29 and 31 35 respectively however i araguaiaensis is still not recognized as a separate species by the committee on taxonomy of the society for marine mammalogy the largest international association of marine mammal scientists in the world the committee made these comments regarding the decision to not include i araguaiaensis as an independent species inia araguaiaensis was described by hrbek et al 2014 however this study only examined samples from two extremes of the distribution of inia so is it unclear if the molecular differences observed represented real species level separation or were due to sampling from two locations separated by a large distance diagnostic osteological differences were also reported however because this was based on the examination of very few specimens only 2 for the new species and only 9 for i

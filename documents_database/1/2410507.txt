for synthetic biology consortia take the ability to engineer novel cell behaviors to a population level consortia are more common than not in nature and generally prove to be more robust than monocultures just over 7 000 species of bacteria have been cultured and identified to date many of the estimated 1 2 million bacteria species that remain have yet to be cultured and identified in part due to inabilities to be cultured axenically evidence for symbiosis between microbes strongly suggests it to have been a necessary precursor of the evolution of land plants and for their transition from algal communities in the sea to land when designing synthetic consortia or editing naturally occurring consortia synthetic biologists keep track of ph temperature initial metabolic profiles incubation times growth rate and other pertinent variables one of the more salient applications of engineering behaviors and interactions between microbes in a community is the ability to combine or even switch metabolisms the combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes allows the unique possibility of a self sufficient community that may produce desired biofuels to be collected co culture dyads of autotrophic synechococcus elongatus and heterotrophic escherichia coli were found to be able to grow

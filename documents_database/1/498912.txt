26 andromedae is the flamsteed designation it has a combined apparent visual magnitude of 6 10 which is near the lower limit of visibility to the naked eye the distance to this system can be estimated from its annual parallax shift of which yields a range of 610 light years at that distance the visual magnitude of the stars is diminished from an extinction of 0 04 due to interstellar dust the system is moving further from the earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of 3 3 km s the magnitude 6 11 primary component a is a b type main sequence star with a stellar classification of b8 v the star has 3 54 times the mass of the sun and 3 76 times the sun s radius it is around 95 million years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 18 km s 26 and is radiating 219 times the sun s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 11 939 k it displays an infrared excess that suggests a circumstellar debris disk orbiting at a distance of from the star with a temperature of 75 k the fainter secondary component b is

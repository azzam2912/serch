the alternative hypothesis is different depending on which version of the test is used but is usually stationarity or trend stationarity it is named after the statisticians david dickey and wayne fuller who developed the test in 1979 a simple ar 1 model is where formula 2 is the variable of interest formula 3 is the time index formula 4 is a coefficient and formula 5 is the error term a unit root is present if formula 6 the model would be non stationary in this case the regression model can be written as where formula 8 is the first difference operator this model can be estimated and testing for a unit root is equivalent to testing formula 9 where formula 10 since the test is done over the residual term rather than raw data it is not possible to use standard t distribution to provide critical values therefore this statistic formula 3 has a specific distribution simply known as the dickey fuller table there are three main versions of the test 1 test for a unit root 2 test for a unit root with drift 3 test for a unit root with drift and deterministic time trend each version

it provides a common interface for submission of computational tasks to different distributed computing systems and thus can enable grid infrastructures of varying size and complexity the set of services and utilities providing the interface is known as arc computing element arc ce arc ce functionality includes data staging and caching developed in order to support data intensive distributed computing arc is an open source software distributed under the apache license 2 0 arc appeared and is still often referred to as the nordugrid middleware originally proposed as an architecture on top of the globus toolkit optimized for the needs of high energy physics computing for the large hadron collider experiments first deployment of arc at the nordugrid testbed took place in summer 2002 and by 2003 it was used to support complex computations the first stable release of arc version 0 4 came out in april 2004 under the gnu general public license the name advanced resource connector was introduced for this release to distinguish the middleware from the infrastructure in the same year the swedish national grid project swegrid became the first large cross discipline infrastructure to be based on arc in 2005 nordugrid was formally established as

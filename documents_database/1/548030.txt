the objective of these technologies is to render an image more usable by fourier or other filtering techniques these technologies were most actively advanced in the 1960s and early 1970s in the fields of strategic reconnaissance and medical electronics the term digital ice initially applied specifically to a proprietary technology developed by kodak s austin development center formerly applied science fiction asf that automatically removes surface defects such as dust and scratches from scanned images the ice technology works from within the scanner so unlike the software only solutions it does not alter any underlying details of the image subsequent to the original digital ice technology circa 1989 which used infrared cleaning additional image enhancement technologies were marketed by applied science fiction and kodak under similar and related names often as part of a suite of compatible technologies the ice technology uses a scanner with a pair of light sources a normal rgb lamp and an infrared ir lamp and scans twice once with each lamp the ir lamp detects the dust locations with its unique detection method and then inpainting is applied based on this data afterwards the general concept is locate scratches and dust on the rgb image

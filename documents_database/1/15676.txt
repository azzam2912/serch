the other two layers are the ectoderm outside layer and endoderm inside layer with the mesoderm as the middle layer between them the mesoderm forms mesenchyme mesothelium non epithelial blood cells and coelomocytes mesothelium lines coeloms mesoderm forms the muscles in a process known as myogenesis septa cross wise partitions and mesenteries length wise partitions and forms part of the gonads the rest being the gametes myogenesis is specifically a function of mesenchyme the mesoderm differentiates from the rest of the embryo through intercellular signaling after which the mesoderm is polarized by an organizing center the position of the organizing center is in turn determined by the regions in which beta catenin is protected from degradation by gsk 3 beta catenin acts as a co factor that alters the activity of the transcription factor tcf 3 from repressing to activating which initiates the synthesis of gene products critical for mesoderm differentiation and gastrulation furthermore mesoderm has the capability to induce the growth of other structures such as the neural plate the precursor to the nervous system the mesoderm is one of the three germinal layers that appears in the third week of embryonic development it is formed through a process

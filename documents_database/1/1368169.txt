for vector bundles the total segre class is inverse to the total chern class and thus provides equivalent information the advantage of the segre class is that it generalizes to more general cones while the chern class does not the segre class was introduced in the non singular case by suppose formula 1 is a cone over formula 2 formula 3 is the projection from the projective completion formula 4 of formula 1 to formula 6 and formula 7 is the anti tautological line bundle on formula 4 viewing the chern class formula 9 as a group endomorphism of the chow group of formula 4 the total segre class of formula 1 is given by the formula 13th segre class formula 14 is simply the formula 13th graded piece of formula 16 if formula 1 is of pure dimension formula 18 over formula 6 then this is given by the reason for using formula 4 rather than formula 22 is that this makes the total segre class stable under addition of the trivial bundle formula 23 if z is a closed subscheme of an algebraic scheme x then formula 24 denote the segre class of the normal cone to formula

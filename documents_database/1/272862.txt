superbit dvds aimed to improve picture quality over a standard dvd edition of a feature by increasing the bit rate of the encoded video audio quality was also improved by the mandatory inclusion of both dolby digital and dts 5 1 surround audio tracks superbit discs can be read by all regular dvd video players but their film files were encoded at a bit rate that is according to sony approximately 1 5 times as high 6 7 mbit s vs 4 5 mbit s as that of standard dvds which helps minimize artifacts caused by video compression and allow the image to be pre filtered less prior to compression which results in more detail superbit should not be confused with either blu ray or hd dvd discs both of which are different media formats of much higher bit rate and resolution and are incompatible with standard dvd video players to maximize space for the main feature static menus are used and commentary tracks are removed to further improve the size and therefore quality of the film on the disc superbit discs contained a reduced amount and usually are completely devoid of so called added value and bonus material such

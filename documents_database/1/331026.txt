the method described by aes47 is also published by the international electrotechnical commission as iec 62365 many professional audio systems are now combined with telecommunication and it technologies to provide new functionality flexibility and connectivity over both local and wide area networks aes47 was developed to provide a standardised method of transporting the standard digital audio per aes3 over telecommunications networks that provide a quality of service required by many professional low latency live audio uses aes47 may be used directly between specialist audio devices or in combination with telecommunication and computer equipment with suitable network interfaces in both cases aes47 the same physical structured cable used as standard by the telecommunications networks common network protocols like ethernet use large packet sizes which produce a larger minimum latency asynchronous transfer mode divides data into 48 byte cells which provide lower latency the original work was carried out at the british broadcasting corporation s r d department and published as white paper 074 which established that this approach provides the necessary performance for professional media production aes47 was originally published in 2002 and was republished with minor revisions in february 2006 amendment 1 to aes47 was published in february 2009 adding

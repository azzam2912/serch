this toltec maya connection is widely considered powerful unprecedented and unique in mesoamerica unlike most maya sites some of chichen itza s buildings have the traits of the toltecs a historically powerful indigenous group from modern day mexico the explanation of these similarities is a point of controversy among the scholars of the toltec and maya fields certain historical records caused many early scholars of the region to assume that a toltec invasion from tula hidalgo usually placed in the ninth or tenth centuries was responsible for a new wave of mexican style maya buildings after the rest of the buildings in chichen itza were built other historical accounts imply a migration from tula to chichen itza an account of the tula records a ruler of the toltecs travelling east which paired with another account of chichen that records a ruler from the west coming and teaching the maya of that city many things supported a direct influence of the toltecs on the maya around 900 1000 a d however recent radiocarbon dating suggests that chichen itza s mexicanized and pure maya constructions were built at the same time and that both were built previous to any recorded toltec invasion

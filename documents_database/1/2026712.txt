department of energy funding the project started as a class project taught by professor thomas jarboe after the end of the class the design was continued by jarboe and phd student derek sutherland who had worked on reactor design at mit as of 2014 plasma densities reached 5x10 m temperatures of 60 ev and maximum operation time of 1 5 ms no confinement time results were available at those temperatures no fusion alpha heating or neutron production were expected dynomak incorporates an iter developed cryogenic pumping system spheromak use an oblate spheroid instead of a tokamak configuration without a central core and without iter s large complex superconducting magnets the magnetic fields are produced by putting electrical fields into the center of the plasma using superconducting tapes wrapped around the vessel such that the plasma contains itself dynomak is smaller simpler and cheaper to build than iter while producing more power the fusion reaction is self sustaining as excess heat is drawn off by a molten salt blanket to power a steam turbine the prototype was about one tenth the scale of a commercial project is able to sustain plasma efficiently higher output would require increased scale and higher plasma

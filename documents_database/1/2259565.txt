it is intended as a comprehensive list of tactical approaches to software quality assurance more widely colloquially known as quality assurance traditionally called by the acronym qa and general application of the test method usually just called testing or sometimes developer testing an installation test assures that the system is installed correctly and working at actual customer s hardware software testing methods are traditionally divided into white and black box testing these two approaches are used to describe the point of view that a test engineer takes when designing test cases white box testing also known as clear box testing glass box testing transparent box testing and structural testing by seeing the source code tests internal structures or workings of a program as opposed to the functionality exposed to the end user in white box testing an internal perspective of the system as well as programming skills are used to design test cases the tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs this is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit e g in circuit testing ict while white box testing can be applied at the unit integration and system levels of the software

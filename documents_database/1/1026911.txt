it is a tunneling protocol that encapsulates ipv6 packets on specially configured ipv4 links according to the specifications of the ip protocol number for 6in4 is 41 per iana reservation the 6in4 packet format consists of the ipv6 packet preceded by an ipv4 packet header thus the encapsulation overhead is the size of the ipv4 header of 20 bytes on ethernet with a maximum transmission unit mtu of 1500 bytes ipv6 packets of 1480 bytes may therefore be transmitted without fragmentation 6in4 tunneling is also referred to as proto 41 static because the endpoints are configured statically although 6in4 tunnels are generally manually configured for example the utility aiccu can configure tunnel parameters automatically after retrieving information from a tunnel information and control protocol tic server the similarly named methods 6to4 or 6over4 describe a different mechanism the 6to4 method makes use of proto 41 too but instead of static configuration of the endpoints the endpoint ipv4 address information is derived from the ipv6 addresses within the ipv6 packet header when an endpoint of a 6in4 tunnel is inside a network that uses network address translation to external networks the dmz feature of a nat router may be used to

it provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and it is a universal reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications products and solutions software frameworks may include support programs compilers code libraries tool sets and application programming interfaces apis that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system frameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries the designers of software frameworks aim to facilitate software developments by allowing designers and programmers to devote their time to meeting software requirements rather than dealing with the more standard low level details of providing a working system thereby reducing overall development time for example a team using a web framework to develop a banking website can focus on writing code particular to banking rather than the mechanics of request handling and state management frameworks often add to the size of programs a phenomenon termed code bloat due to customer demand driven applications needs both competing and complementary frameworks sometimes end up in a product further due to the complexity of their apis the intended reduction in overall development time

several species are under threat in the wild mainly from habitat destruction they are small tortoises ranging in length from 7 0 to 35 cm and in weight from 0 7 to 7 0 kg the systematics and taxonomy of testudo is notoriously problematic highfield and martin commented synonymies on testudo are notoriously difficult to compile with any degree of accuracy the status of species referred has undergone a great many changes each change introducing an additional level of complexity and making bibliographic research on the taxa extremely difficult most early and not a few later checklists contain a very high proportion of entirely spurious entries and a considerable number of described species are now considered invalid either because they are homonyms non binomial or for some other reason since then dna sequence data have increasingly been used in systematics but in testudines turtles and tortoises its usefulness is limited in some of these at least mtdna is known to evolve more slowly in these than in most other animals paleobiogeographical considerations suggest the rate of evolution of the mitochondrial 12s rrna gene is 1 0 1 6 per million years for the last dozen million years or so in

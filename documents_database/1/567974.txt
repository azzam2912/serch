as with other cell cycle proteins or genes such as cdc2 and cdc4 the cdc in its name refers to cell division cycle dual specificity phosphatases are considered a sub class of protein tyrosine phosphatases by removing inhibitory phosphate residues from target cyclin dependent kinases cdks cdc25 proteins control entry into and progression through various phases of the cell cycle including mitosis and s synthesis phase cdc25 activates cyclin dependent kinases by removing phosphate from residues in the cdk active site in turn the phosphorylation by m cdk a complex of cdk1 and cyclin b activates cdc25 together with wee1 m cdk activation is switch like the switch like behavior forces entry into mitosis to be quick and irreversible cdk activity can be reactivated after dephosphorylation by cdc25 the cdc25 enzymes cdc25a c are known to control the transitions from g1 to s phase and g2 to m phase the structure of cdc25 proteins can be divided into two main regions the n terminal region which is highly divergent and contains sites for its phosphorylation and ubiquitination which regulate the phosphatase activity and the c terminal region which is highly homologous and contains the catalytic site cdc25 enzymes are well

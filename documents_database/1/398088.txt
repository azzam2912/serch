importantly the world line of a particle free from all external non gravitational forces is a particular type of geodesic in other words a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic in general relativity gravity can be regarded as not a force but a consequence of a curved spacetime geometry where the source of curvature is the stress energy tensor representing matter for instance thus for example the path of a planet orbiting a star is the projection of a geodesic of the curved 4 d spacetime geometry around the star onto 3 d space the full geodesic equation is where s is a scalar parameter of motion e g the proper time and formula 2 are christoffel symbols sometimes called the affine connection coefficients or levi civita connection coefficients which is symmetric in the two lower indices greek indices may take the values 0 1 2 3 and the summation convention is used for repeated indices formula 3 and formula 4 the quantity on the left hand side of this equation is the acceleration of a particle and so this equation is analogous to newton s laws of motion which likewise provide formulae for the acceleration

this phenomenon was first discovered by scientists from the max planck institute for metals research in stuttgart markus j buehler and huajian gao and ibm almaden research center in san jose california farid f abraham the issues of intersonic and supersonic fracture become the frontier of dynamic fracture mechanics the work of burridge initiated the exploration for intersonic crack growth when the crack tip velocity v is between the shear in wave speed c 8 and the longitudinal wave speed c 1 supersonic fracture was a phenomenon totally unexplained by the classical theories of fracture molecular dynamics simulations by the group around abraham and gao have shown the existence of intersonic mode i and supersonic mode ii cracks this motivated a continuum mechanics analysis of supersonic mode iii cracks by yang recent progress in the theoretical understanding of hyperelasticity in dynamic fracture has shown that supersonic crack propagation can only be understood by introducing a new length scale called which governs the process of energy transport near a crack tip the crack dynamics is completely dominated by material properties inside a zone surrounding the crack tip with characteristic size equal to when the material inside this characteristic zone is stiffened

dvtosu is a diallyl acetal and the precursor for the isomeric ketene acetal monomer 3 9 diethylidene 2 4 8 10 tetraoxaspiro 5 5 undecane detosu which is a building block for polyorthoesters according to the nomenclature proposed by adolf von baeyer the spiro compound is a spiro 5 5 undecane or due to its four oxygen atoms a 2 4 8 10 tetraoxaspiro 5 5 undecane which carries one allyl group in each of the 3 and 9 positions condensation products from propenal and pentaerythritol were first described in 1950 the synthesis is carried using a general synthesis method for acetals at acid ph ph 3 5 by reacting an alcohol with an excess of aldehyde which is stabilized with hydroquinone in the case of propenal which tends to polymerize at elevated temperature after 19 hours of heating under reflux neutralization of the oxalic acid removal of excess aldehyde and the reaction water the residue is fractionated under vacuum and diallylidene pentaerythritol is obtained in 87 yield after recrystallization from 60 methanol pure dvtosu is obtained in 79 yield with a boiling point of 108 110 c at 2 torr and a melting point of 42 42 c the

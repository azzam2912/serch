the engine has a spinning disk with curved blades once fuel and air enter the engine the rotation of the disk creates shockwaves that compress the mixture when ignited the burning mixture expands pushing against the blades causing them to spin the spinning of the disk itself opens and closes intake and exhaust ports the proposed concept was called a radial internal combustion wave rotor wave rotors utilize shock waves to transfer energy between a high energy fluid to a low energy fluid thereby increasing both temperature and pressure of the low energy fluid also called pressure wave machines or pressure exchangers as with all heat engines the efficiency of a wave disk engine is governed by the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides see carnot s theorem compared to a conventional piston engine reciprocating engine a wave disk engine works at higher peak temperature which theoretically makes it more efficient the design also works without a cooling system saving weight compared to turbine based systems the rotational speed and the rotor blade temperature of the wave disk engine is lower which creates lower stress on materials and consequently less demanding requirements for materials leading to cheaper manufacturing

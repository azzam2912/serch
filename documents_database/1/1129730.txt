this protein is an alpha chain of type vi collagen that aids in microfibril formation as part of type vi collagen this protein has been implicated in bethlem myopathy ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy ucmd and other diseases related to muscle and connective tissue this gene encodes the alpha 3 chain one of the three alpha chains of type vi collagen a beaded filament collagen found in most connective tissues the alpha 3 chain of type vi collagen is much larger than the alpha 1 and 2 chains this difference in size is largely due to an increase in the number of subdomains similar to von willebrand factor type a domains found in the amino terminal globular domain of all the alpha chains in addition to the full length transcript four transcript variants have been identified that encode proteins with n terminal globular domains of varying sizes the alpha 3 type vi chain has been shown to bind extracellular matrix proteins an interaction that explains the importance of this collagen in organizing matrix components microfibril formation has been traced to interactions between its n terminal subdomain n5 and its c terminal c5 domain in adjacent type vi collagen monomers mutations in

geotechnical engineering is important in civil engineering but also has applications in military mining petroleum and other engineering disciplines that are concerned with construction occurring on the surface or within the ground geotechnical engineering uses principles of soil mechanics and rock mechanics to investigate subsurface conditions and materials determine the relevant physical mechanical and chemical properties of these materials evaluate stability of natural slopes and man made soil deposits assess risks posed by site conditions design earthworks and structure foundations and monitor site conditions earthwork and foundation construction a typical geotechnical engineering project begins with a review of project needs to define the required material properties then follows a site investigation of soil rock fault distribution and bedrock properties on and below an area of interest to determine their engineering properties including how they will interact with on or in a proposed construction site investigations are needed to gain an understanding of the area in or on which the engineering will take place investigations can include the assessment of the risk to humans property and the environment from natural hazards such as earthquakes landslides sinkholes soil liquefaction debris flows and rockfalls a geotechnical engineer then determines and designs the type

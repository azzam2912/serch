examples of such phenomena include a molecule changing quantum states the event horizon of a black hole or anything that otherwise might be impossible or too dangerous to observe under normal laboratory conditions this term may also refer to a lab that uses primarily electronic equipment for example a robotics lab a dry lab can also refer to a laboratory space for the storage of dry materials the term dry lab is also used in the photo printing industry to refer to photo printing systems that do not employ the use of wet photographic chemicals dry labbing can also refer to supplying fictional yet plausible results in lieu of performing an assigned experiment as computing power has grown exponentially this approach to research often referred to as in silico as opposed to in vitro has amassed more attention especially in the area of bioinformatics more specifically within bioinformatics is the study of proteins or proteomics which is the elucidation of their unknown structures and folding patterns the general approach in the elucidation of protein structure has been to first purify a protein crystallize it and then send x rays through such a purified protein crystal to observe how these x

normal coordinates decouple the classical vibrational motions of the molecule and thus give an easy route to obtaining vibrational amplitudes of the atoms as a function of time in wilson s gf method it is assumed that the molecular kinetic energy consists only of harmonic vibrations of the atoms i e overall rotational and translational energy is ignored normal coordinates appear also in a quantum mechanical description of the vibrational motions of the molecule and the coriolis coupling between rotations and vibrations it follows from application of the eckart conditions that the matrix g gives the kinetic energy in terms of arbitrary linear internal coordinates while f represents the harmonic potential energy in terms of these coordinates the gf method gives the linear transformation from general internal coordinates to the special set of normal coordinates a non linear molecule consisting of n atoms has 3 n 6 internal degrees of freedom because positioning a molecule in three dimensional space requires three degrees of freedom and the description of its orientation in space requires another three degree of freedom these degrees of freedom must be subtracted from the 3 n degrees of freedom of a system of n particles the interaction

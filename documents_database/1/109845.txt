it provides basic classes such as wrapper classes and data structure classes this framework uses the prefix ns for nextstep or next sun microsystems this class is the most common base class for objective c hierarchies and provides standard methods for working with objects by managing the memory associated with them and querying them a class used for string manipulation representing a unicode string most typically using utf 16 as its internal format nsstring is immutable and thus can only be initialized but not modified nsmutablestring is a modifiable version nsvalue is a wrapper class for c data types and nsnumber is a wrapper class for c number data types such as int double and float the data structures in foundation kit can only hold objects not primitive types so wrappers such as nsvalue and nsnumber are used in those data structures a dynamic array of objects supporting constant time indexing nsarray is an immutable version that can only be initialized with objects but not modified nsmutablearray may be modified by adding and removing objects an associative data container of key value pairs with unique keys searching and element addition and removal in the case of nsmutabledictionary is faster than

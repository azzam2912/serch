the implementation of a number of basic mathematical concepts is carried out in parallel in zfc the dominant set theory and in nfu the version of quine s new foundations shown to be consistent by r b jensen in 1969 here understood to include at least axioms of infinity and choice what is said here applies also to two families of set theories on the one hand a range of theories including zermelo set theory near the lower end of the scale and going up to zfc extended with large cardinal hypotheses such as there is a measurable cardinal and on the other hand a hierarchy of extensions of nfu which is surveyed in the new foundations article these correspond to different general views of what the set theoretical universe is like and it is the approaches to implementation of mathematical concepts under these two general views that are being compared and contrasted it is not the primary aim of this article to say anything about the relative merits of these theories as foundations for mathematics the reason for the use of two different set theories is to illustrate that multiple approaches to the implementation of mathematics are feasible precisely

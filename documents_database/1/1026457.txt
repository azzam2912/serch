there are three forms of ror ror and and each is encoded by a separate gene rora rorb and rorc respectively the rors are somewhat unusual in that they appear to bind as monomers to hormone response elements as opposed to the majority of other nuclear receptors which bind as dimers while the identity of natural ligands for the rors remains controversial similar to the liver x receptors lxrs it appears that the rors are activated by oxysterols furthermore the rors appear to be constitutively active absence of ligand and that activity may be due to continuously bound natural ligands side chain oxygenated sterols e g 20 hydroxycholesterol 22r hydroxycholesterol and 25 hydroxycholesterol are high affinity ror agonists while sterols oxygenated at the 7 position e g 7 hydroxycholesterol and 7 ketocholesterol function as inverse agonists for both rora and ror a number of other natural substances have also been reported to bind to the rors these include all trans retinoic acid binds with high affinity to ror and but not ror finally the rors may function as lipid sensors and hence may play a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism melatonin has been claimed to be an endogenous

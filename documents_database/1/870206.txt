it has an apparent visual magnitude of 3 01 making it readily visible with the naked eye parallax measurements give it a distance of about from the earth the spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of b5 iii which indicates it is a giant star that has evolved away from the main sequence after exhausting the hydrogen at its core it has about seven times the sun s mass and has an estimated age of 6 8 million years the effective temperature of the outer envelope is 14 890 k with the energy being emitted at this temperature giving it the blue white hue that is a characteristic of a b type star it is rotating rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 190 km s which gives a lower bound for the actual azimuthal velocity along the star s equator this is most probably a binary star and may be a triple star system it has an optical companion with an apparent magnitude of 6 17 at an angular separation of 0 330 arcseconds and a position angle of 221 but it is uncertain whether this is an optical double star or a gravitationally bound companion the

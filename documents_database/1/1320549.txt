radioactive waste contains a mixture of short lived and long lived nuclides as well as non radioactive nuclides there was reported some 47 000 tonnes of high level nuclear waste stored in the usa in 2002 the most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are neptunium 237 half life two million years and plutonium 239 half life 24 000 years consequently high level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the biosphere this usually necessitates treatment followed by a long term management strategy involving permanent storage disposal or transformation of the waste into a non toxic form radioactive decay follows the half life rule which means that the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay in other words the radiation from a long lived isotope like iodine 129 will be much less intense than that of short lived isotope like iodine 131 governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options usually involving deep geologic placement although there has been limited progress toward implementing long term waste management solutions this is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10 000

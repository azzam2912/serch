it is typified by the classic rallying style of rear wheel drive cars where a car travels around a bend with a large drift angle the terms opposite lock and counter steering refer to the position of the steering wheel during the maneuver which is turned in the opposite direction to that of the bend the technique works best on loose or wet surfaces where the friction between the tires and the road is not too high but can also be used on asphalt or other surfaces with high friction if the vehicle has enough power to maintain speed before entry to the bend the car is turned towards the bend slightly but quickly so as to cause a rotating motion that induces the rear of the car to slide outwards power is applied which applies further sideways movement at the same time opposite lock steering is applied to keep the car on the desired course as the car reaches the bend it will have already turned through most of the needed angle traveling sideways and losing some speed as a result a smooth application of power at this point will accelerate the car into the bend and then through

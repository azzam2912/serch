it is ultimately the interaction between circadian rhythms and the environment a central example is the entrainment of circadian rhythms to the daily light dark cycle which ultimately is determined by the earth s rotation exposure to certain environmental stimuli will cue a phase shift and abrupt change in the timing of the rhythm entrainment helps organisms maintain an adaptive phase relationship with the environment as well as prevent drifting of a free running rhythm this stable phase relationship achieved is thought to be the main function of entrainment there are two general modes of entrainment phasic and continuous the phasic mode is when there is limited interaction with the environment to reset the clock every day by the amount equal to the error which is the difference between the environmental cycle and the organism s circadian rhythm the continuous mode is when the circadian rhythm is continuously adjusted by the environment usually by constant light two properties the free running period of an organism and the phase response curve are the main pieces of information needed to investigate individual entrainment there are also limits to entrainment although there may be individual differences in this limit most organisms have a

exit times and return times are also examples of hitting times let t be an ordered index set such as the natural numbers n the non negative real numbers 0 or a subset of these elements t t can be thought of as times given a probability space pr and a measurable state space s let x t s be a stochastic process and let a be a measurable subset of the state space s then the first hit time 0 is the random variable defined by the first exit time from a is defined to be the first hit time for s a the complement of a in s confusingly this is also often denoted by the first return time is defined to be the first hit time for the singleton set x which is usually a given deterministic element of the state space such as the origin of the coordinate system the hitting time of a set f is also known as the d but of f the d but theorem says that the hitting time of a measurable set f for a progressively measurable process is a stopping time progressively measurable processes include in particular all right

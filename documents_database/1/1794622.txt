there are two rumor models that are widely used i e dk model and mk model particularly we can view rumor spread as a stochastic process in social networks in the last few years there has been a growing interest in rumor propagation in online social networks problems where different approaches have been proposed to investigate it by carefully scrutinizing the existing literature we categorize the works into macroscopic and microscopic approaches the first category is mainly based on the epidemic models where the pioneering research engaging rumor propagation under these models started during the 1960s a standard model of rumor spreading was introduced by daley and kendall which is called dk model assume there are n people in total and those people in the network are categorized into three groups ignorants spreaders and stiflers which are denoted as s i and r respectively hereinafter the rumor is propagated through the population by pair wise contacts between spreaders and others in the population any spreader involved in a pair wise meeting attempts to infect the other individual with the rumor in the case this other individual is an ignorant he or she becomes a spreader in the other two cases

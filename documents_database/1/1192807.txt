these neutrons then to state it simply either react with the fuel in the reactor or escape from the reactor these two processes are referred to as neutron absorption and neutron leakage and their sum is the neutron loss when the rate of neutron production is equal to the rate of neutron loss the reactor is able to sustain a chain reaction of nuclear fissions and is considered a critical reactor geometric buckling is a measure of neutron leakage and material buckling is a measure of the difference between neutron production and neutron absorption in the case of a bare homogenous steady state reactor that is a reactor that has only one region a homogenous mixture of fuel and coolant no blanket nor reflector and does not change over time the geometric and material buckling are equal to each other both buckling terms are derived from the diffusion equation formula 1 where k is the criticality eigenvalue formula 2 is the neutrons per fission formula 3 is the macroscopic cross section for fission and from diffusion theory the diffusion coefficient is defined as formula 4 in addition the diffusion length is defined as formula 5 rearranging the terms the diffusion

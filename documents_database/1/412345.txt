it is actively imported into the endoplasmic reticulum of cells via glucose transporters it is trapped therein by reduction back to ascorbate by glutathione and other thiols the free chemical radical semidehydroascorbic acid sda also belongs to the group of oxidized ascorbic acids although a sodium dependent transporter for vitamin c exists it is present mainly in specialized cells whereas the glucose transporters the most notable being glut1 transport vitamin c in its oxidized form dha in most cells where recycling back to ascorbate generates the necessary enzyme cofactor and intracellular antioxidant see transport to mitochondria the structure shown here for dha is the commonly shown textbook structure this 1 2 3 tricarbonyl is too electrophilic to survive more than a few milliseconds in aqueous solution however the actual structure shown by spectroscopic studies is the result of rapid hemiacetal formation between the 6 oh and the 3 carbonyl groups hydration of the 2 carbonyl is also observed the lifetime of the stabilized species is commonly said to be about 6 minutes under biological conditions destruction results from irreversible hydrolysis of the ester bond with additional degradation reactions following crystallization of solutions of dha gives a pentacyclic dimer structure of

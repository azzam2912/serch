since locally compact abelian groups have a well understood theory pontryagin duality which includes the basic structures of fourier series and fourier transforms the major business of non commutative harmonic analysis is usually taken to be the extension of the theory to all groups g that are locally compact the case of compact groups is understood qualitatively and after the peter weyl theorem from the 1920s as being generally analogous to that of finite groups and their character theory the main task is therefore the case of g that is locally compact not compact and not commutative the interesting examples include many lie groups and also algebraic groups over p adic fields these examples are of interest and frequently applied in mathematical physics and contemporary number theory particularly automorphic representations what to expect is known as the result of basic work of john von neumann he showed that if the von neumann group algebra of g is of type i then l g as a unitary representation of g is a direct integral of irreducible representations it is parametrized therefore by the unitary dual the set of isomorphism classes of such representations which is given the hull kernel topology the

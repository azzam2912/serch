it was developed as part of research by the pair into computer science and machine learning turochamp is capable of playing an entire chess game against a human player at a low level of play by calculating all potential moves and all of the potential player moves in response assigning point values to each game state and selecting the move with the highest average possible point value turochamp is the earliest known computer game to enter development but was never completed by turing and champernowne as its algorithm was too complex to be run by the early computers of the time such as the automatic computing engine turing attempted to convert the program into executable code for the 1951 ferranti mark 1 computer in manchester but was unable to do so turing played a match against computer scientist alick glennie using the program in the summer of 1952 executing it manually step by step but by his death in 1954 had still been unable to run the program on an actual computer champernowne did not continue the project and the original program design was not preserved despite never being run on a computer the program is a candidate for the

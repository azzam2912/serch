faber and robert earl jackson in 1976 their relation can be expressed mathematically as with the index formula 4 approximately equal to 4 in 1962 rudolph minkowski had discovered and wrote that a correlation between velocity dispersion and luminosity exists but it is poor and that it seems important to extend the observations to more objects especially at low and medium absolute magnitudes this was important because the value of formula 4 depends on the range of galaxy luminosities that is fitted with a value of 2 for low luminosity elliptical galaxies discovered by a team led by roger davies and a value of 5 reported by paul l schechter for luminous elliptical galaxies the faber jackson relation is understood as a projection of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies one of its main uses is as a tool for determining distances to external galaxies the gravitational potential of a mass distribution of radius formula 6 and mass formula 7 is given by the expression where is a constant depending e g on the density profile of the system and g is the gravitational constant for a constant density formula 9 the kinetic energy is recall formula 2 is the

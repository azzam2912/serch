causes may include component aging changes in temperature that alter the piezoelectric effect in a crystal oscillator or problems with a voltage regulator which controls the bias voltage to the oscillator frequency drift is traditionally measured in hz s frequency stability can be regarded as the absence or a very low level of frequency drift on a radio transmitter frequency drift can cause a radio station to drift into an adjacent channel causing illegal interference because of this frequency allocation regulations specify the allowed tolerance for such oscillators in a type accepted device a temperature compensated voltage controlled crystal oscillator tcvcxo is normally used for frequency modulation on the receiver side frequency drift was mainly a problem in early tuners particularly for analog dial tuning and especially on fm which exhibits a capture effect however the use of a phase locked loop pll essentially eliminates the drift issue for transmitters a numerically controlled oscillator nco also does not have problems with drift drift differs from doppler shift which is a perceived difference in frequency due to motion of the source or receiver even though the source is still producing the same wavelength it also differs from frequency deviation which is

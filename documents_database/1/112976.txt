this is due to a 41000 year cycle in which the tilt of the earth changes between 22 and 24 5 at present 2000 ad we are in a dry period but it is expected that the sahara will become green again in 15000 years 17000 ad during the last glacial period the sahara was much larger than it is today extending south beyond its current boundaries the end of the glacial period brought more rain to the sahara from about 8000 bc to 6000 bc perhaps because of low pressure areas over the collapsing ice sheets to the north once the ice sheets were gone the northern sahara dried out in the southern sahara the drying trend was initially counteracted by the monsoon which brought rain further north than it does today by around 4200 bc however the monsoon retreated south to approximately where it is today leading to the gradual desertification of the sahara the sahara is now as dry as it was about 13 000 years ago these conditions are responsible for what has been called the sahara pump theory during periods of a wet or green sahara the sahara becomes a savanna grassland and various flora

they are similar to recumbent bicycles and tricycles but with a full fairing aerodynamic shell a fairing may be added to a non faired cycle or the fairing may be an integral part of the structure monocoque like that of an airplane they are not to be confused with purpose built for racing or speed records fully fared vehicles with two wheels generally called streamliners streamliners have set many speed and distance records though fast in their own right velomobiles are considered much more streetable machines using three or more wheels can have advantages for everyday use including the ability to stop and start unaided better stability cross wind handling etc though there are arguments made that the multiple track machines three or more wheels have aerodynamic disadvantages due to the drag of the extra wheels and the surface contact points in practice though velomobiles continue to be close to their two wheel cousins in performance there are few velomobile manufacturers some are home built some models have the operator s head exposed this has the advantage of giving the operator unobstructed vision hearing and some cooling with the disadvantage of being potentially more exposed to weather and less aerodynamic

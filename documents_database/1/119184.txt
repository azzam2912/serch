the miniature aircraft and horizon bar mimic the relationship of the aircraft relative to the actual horizon it is a primary instrument for flight in instrument meteorological conditions attitude is always presented to users in the unit degrees however inner workings such as sensors data and calculations may use a mix of degrees and radians as scientists and engineers may prefer to work with radians the essential components of the ai include a symbolic miniature aircraft mounted so that it appears to be flying relative to the horizon an adjustment knob to account for the pilot s line of vision moves the aircraft up and down to align it against the horizon bar the top half of the instrument is blue to represent the sky while the bottom half is brown to represent the ground the bank index at the top shows the aircraft angle of bank reference lines in the middle indicate the degree of pitch up or down relative to the horizon most russian built aircraft have a somewhat different design the background display is colored as in a western instrument but moves up and down only to indicate pitch a symbol representing the aircraft which is fixed

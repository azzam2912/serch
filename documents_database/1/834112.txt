one speaks of the circuit complexity of a boolean circuit a related notion is the circuit complexity of a recursive language that is decided by a uniform family of circuits formula 1 see below complexity classes defined in terms of boolean circuits include ac ac tc and nc a boolean circuit with formula 2 input bits is a directed acyclic graph in which every node usually called gates in this context is either an input node of in degree 0 labelled by one of the formula 2 input bits an and gate an or gate or a not gate one of these gates is designated as the output gate such a circuit naturally computes a function of its formula 2 inputs the size of a circuit is the number of gates it contains and its depth is the maximal length of a path from an input gate to the output gate there are two major notions of circuit complexity these are outlined in sipser 1997 the circuit size complexity of a boolean function formula 5 is the minimal size of any circuit computing formula 5 the circuit depth complexity of a boolean function formula 5 is the minimal depth of

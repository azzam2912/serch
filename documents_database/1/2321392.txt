the disease is caused by the saprophytic fungus cladosporium herbarum and is characterized by black or dark green fungal growths that cause black streaks on kernels c herbarum s main host is maize although there is usually little structural damage caused to the ears the following symptoms are obvious during inspection plants that have poor husk coverage and weak seed coats allow for more frequent infection other factors that contribute to more infections are air currents that transport spores and an increase in vectors including humans c herbarum is also known to infect various genera of mosses and interact with fusarium species that cause fusarium ear rot and stalk rot some of these fusarium species produce mycotoxins that are harmful to humans and animals the color of the fungal growth can be used to tell the various ear rots apart for example cladosporium ear rot looks similar to trichoderma ear rot but trichoderma ear rot has a more intense green color microscopic examination is needed to tell the difference for sure environmental conditions that favor the infection and growth of cladosporium herbarum are typical for most fungi such as high moisture correct temperature low air flow and neutral ph moisture

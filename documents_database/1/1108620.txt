the gene product is a glycosylated transmembrane protein that functions in both the peripheral and central nervous system to modulate the release of various neurotransmitters multiple transcript variants encoding proteins with distinct c terminal sequences have been described but the full length nature of some transcript variants has not been determined the receptor is located in the alimentary tract urinary bladder heart and adrenal gland as well as the central nervous system cns in the cns the receptor appears in the putamen caudate nucleus nucleus accumbens globus pallidus and substantia nigra and to a lesser extent in the neocortex raphe pontine nuclei and some areas of the thalamus it has not been found in the cerebellum internalization is isoform specific several drugs that act as 5 ht selective agonists have recently been introduced into use in both scientific research and clinical medicine some drugs that act as 5 ht agonists are also active as 5 ht antagonists such as mosapride metoclopramide renzapride and zacopride and so these compounds cannot be considered highly selective research in this area is ongoing sb 207 145 radiolabeled with carbon 11 is used as a radioligand for 5 ht in positron emission tomography pig and

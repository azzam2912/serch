the large ones are known as maria seas and the small ones as lac s lakes the possibility that there were seas on titan was first suggested based on data from the voyager 1 and 2 space probes launched in august and september 1977 the data showed titan to have a thick atmosphere of approximately the correct temperature and composition to support them direct evidence was not obtained until 1995 when data from the hubble space telescope and other observations had already suggested the existence of liquid methane on titan either in disconnected pockets or on the scale of satellite wide oceans similar to water on earth the cassini mission affirmed the former hypothesis although not immediately when the probe arrived in the saturnian system in 2004 it was hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans might be detectable by reflected sunlight from the surface of any liquid bodies but no specular reflections were initially observed the possibility remained that liquid ethane and methane might be found on titan s polar regions where they were expected to be abundant and stable in titan s south polar region an enigmatic dark feature named ontario lacus was the first suspected lake identified possibly

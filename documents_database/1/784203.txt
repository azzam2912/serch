they are primarily used to separate emulsions into their components via various processes operating in reverse to an emulsifier there are two types of coalescers mechanical coalescers use filters or baffles to make droplets coalesce while electrostatic coalescers use dc or ac electric fields or combinations a coalescer which operates by method of physical alteration or involvement of a droplet is influenced by mechanical or physical means a more common type of coalescer mechanical coalescers are applied in oil and gas industries worldwide for removal of water or hydrocarbon condensate while coalescers by definition function as a separation tool for liquids they are commonly used and mistakenly referred to as filters in the area of compressed air purification coalescing filters are used to separate liquid water and oil from compressed air using a coalescing effect coalescence physics shows how coalescing filters operating at lower temperatures and high pressures work better these filters additionally remove particles the most commonly used media in this case is borosilicate micro fiber in the oil and gas petrochemical and oil refining industries liquid gas coalescers are widely used to remove water and hydrocarbon liquids to btx benzene toluene and xylene as well as disposal issues

petrified wood typifies this process but all organisms from bacteria to vertebrates can become petrified although harder more durable matter such as bone beaks and shells survive the process better than softer remains such as muscle tissue feathers or skin petrifaction takes place through a combination of two similar processes permineralization and replacement these processes create replicas of the original specimen that are similar down to the microscopic level one of the processes involved in petrifaction is permineralization the fossils created through this process tend to contain a large amount of the original material of the specimen this process occurs when groundwater containing dissolved minerals most commonly quartz calcite pyrite siderite iron carbonate and apatite calcium phosphate fills pore spaces and cavities of specimens particularly bone shell or wood the pores of the organisms tissues are filled when these minerals precipitate out of the water two common types of permineralization are silicification and pyritization silicification is the process in which organic matter becomes saturated with silica a common source of silica is volcanic material studies have shown that in this process most of the original organic matter is destroyed silicification most often occurs in two environments either the specimen is

examples are nephroblastoma medulloblastoma and retinoblastoma the suffix blastoma is used to imply a tumor of primitive incompletely differentiated or precursor cells e g chondroblastoma is composed of cells resembling the precursor of chondrocytes many types of blastoma have been linked to a mutation in tumor suppressor genes for example pleuropulmonary blastomas have been linked to a mutation of the coding for p53 however the mutation which allows proliferation of incompletely differentiated cells can vary from patient to patient and a mutation can alter the prognosis in the case of retinoblastoma patients carry a visibly abnormal karyotype with a loss of function mutation on a specific band of chromosome 13 this recessive deletion on the rb gene is also associated with other cancer types and must be present on both alleles for a normal cell to progress towards malignancy thus in the case of common blastomas such as retinoblastomas a practitioner may go directly into treatment but in the case of rarer more genetically linked blastomas practitioners may karyotype the patient before proceeding with treatment some examples of blastomas are hepatoblastoma medulloblastoma nephroblastoma neuroblastoma pancreatoblastoma pleuropulmonary blastoma retinoblastoma glioblastoma multiforme and gonadoblastoma hepatoblastoma hbl is the first most common malignancy

the corresponding first order theory is the set of sentences that are actually true of the real numbers there are several different such theories with different expressive power depending on the primitive operations that are allowed to be used in the expression a fundamental question in the study of these theories is whether they are decidable that is is there an algorithm that can take a sentence as input and produce as output an answer yes or no to the question of whether the sentence is true in the theory the theory of real closed fields is the theory in which the primitives operations are multiplication and addition this implies that in this theory the only numbers that can be defined are the real algebraic numbers as proven by tarski it is decidable see tarski seidenberg theorem and quantifier elimination current implementations of decision procedures for the theory of real closed fields are often based on quantifier elimination by cylindrical algebraic decomposition tarski s exponential function problem concerns the extension of this theory to another primitive operation the exponential function it is an open problem whether it is decidable but if schanuel s conjecture holds then the decidability of this

it is a generalisation of the parallelogram law which in turn can be seen as generalisation of the pythagorean theorem because of the latter the restatement of the pythagorean theorem in terms of quadrilaterals is occasionally called the euler pythagoras theorem for a convex quadrilateral with sides formula 1 diagonals formula 2 and formula 3 and formula 4 being the line segment connecting the midpoints of the two diagonals the following equations holds if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram then the midpoints of the diagonals coincide so that the connecting line segment formula 4 has length 0 in addition the parallel sides are of equal length hence euler s theorem reduces to which is the parallelogram law if the quadrilateral is rectangle then equation simplifies further since now the two diagonals are of equal length as well dividing by 2 yields the euler pythagoras theorem in other words in the case of a rectangle the relation of the quadrilateral s sides and its diagonals is described by the pythagorean theorem euler originally derived the theorem above as corollary from slightly different theorem that on the one hand appears less elegant as it requires the introduction of an additional point but

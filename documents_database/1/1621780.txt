jigu suanjing was included as one of the requisite texts for imperial examination the amount of time required for the study of jigu suanjing was three years the same as for the nine chapters on the mathematical art and haidao suanjing the book began with presentations to the emperor followed by a pursuit problem similar to the one in jiu zhang suan shu followed by 13 three dimensional geometry problems based mostly on engineering construction of astronomic observation tower dike barn excavation of a canal bed etc and 6 problems in right angled triangle plane geometry apart from the first problem which was solved by arithmetic the problems deal with the solution of cubic equations the first known chinese work to deal with complete cubic equations as such it played important roles in the development for solution of high order polynomial equations in the history of chinese mathematics before his time the nine chapters on the mathematical art developed algorithm of solving simple cubic equation formula 1 numerically often referred to as the finding the root method wang xiaotong used an algebraic method to solve three dimensional geometry problems and his work is a major advance in algebra in the

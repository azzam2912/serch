it has applications to chemistry mechanical engineering and electrical engineering particularly in relation to semiconductor manufacturing solids are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface the surface which bounds the bulk material is called the surface phase it acts as an interface to the surrounding environment the bulk material in a solid is called the bulk phase the surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment this interaction can degrade the surface phase over time environmental degradation of the surface phase over time can be caused by wear corrosion fatigue and creep surface engineering involves altering the properties of the surface phase in order to reduce the degradation over time this is accomplished by making the surface robust to the environment in which it will be used it provides a cost effective material for robust design a spectrum of topics that represent the diverse nature of the field of surface engineering includes plating technologies nano and emerging technologies and surface engineering characterization and testing surface engineering techniques are being used in the automotive aerospace missile power electronic biomedical textile petroleum petrochemical chemical steel cement machine tools and construction industries including road surfacing surface engineering techniques can

gases behave in a similar way over a wide variety of conditions because they all have molecules which are widely spaced and the equation of state for an ideal gas is derived from kinetic theory the earlier gas laws are now considered as special cases of the ideal gas equation with one or more variables held constant in 1662 robert boyle studied the relationship between volume and pressure of a gas of fixed amount at constant temperature he observed that volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at a constant temperature boyle s law published in 1662 states that at constant temperature the product of the pressure and volume of a given mass of an ideal gas in a closed system is always constant it can be verified experimentally using a pressure gauge and a variable volume container it can also be derived from the kinetic theory of gases if a container with a fixed number of molecules inside is reduced in volume more molecules will strike a given area of the sides of the container per unit time causing a greater pressure a statement of boyle s law is as follows the

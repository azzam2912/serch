thus it can be considered a gravity adjusted height at an elevation of h the geopotential is defined as where formula 2 is the acceleration due to gravity formula 3 is latitude and z is the geometric elevation thus geopotential is the gravitational potential energy per unit mass at that elevation h the geopotential height is which normalizes the geopotential to g the standard gravity at mean sea level geophysical sciences such as meteorology often prefer to express the horizontal pressure gradient force as the gradient of geopotential along a constant pressure surface because then it has the properties of a conservative force for example the primitive equations which weather forecast models solve use hydrostatic pressure as a vertical coordinate and express the slopes of those pressure surfaces in terms of geopotential height a plot of geopotential height for a single pressure level in the atmosphere shows the troughs and ridges highs and lows which are typically seen on upper air charts the geopotential thickness between pressure levels difference of the 850 hpa and 1000 hpa geopotential heights for example is proportional to mean virtual temperature in that layer geopotential height contours can be used to calculate the geostrophic wind

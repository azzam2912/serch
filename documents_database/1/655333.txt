bodies without atmospheres including the moon mercury the asteroids comets and most of the moons of other planets take on many weathering processes space weathering is important because these processes affect the physical and optical properties of the surface of many planetary bodies therefore it is critical to understand the effects of space weathering in order to properly interpret remotely sensed data much of our knowledge of the space weathering process comes from studies of the lunar samples returned by the apollo program particularly the lunar soils or regolith the constant flux of high energy particles and micrometeorites along with larger meteorites act to comminute melt sputter and vaporize components of the lunar soil the first products of space weathering that were recognized in lunar soils were agglutinates these are created when micrometeorites melt a small amount of material which incorporates surrounding glass and mineral fragments into a glass welded aggregate ranging in size from a few micrometers to a few millimeters agglutinates are very common in lunar soil accounting for as much as 60 to 70 of mature soils these complex and irregularly shaped particles appear black to the human eye largely due to the presence of nanophase iron

it is a fundamental specification for combustion engines the dynamic compression ratio is a more advanced calculation which also takes into account gasses entering and exiting the cylinder during the compression phase most engines used a fixed compression ratio however a variable compression ratio engine is able to adjust the compression ratio while the engine is in operation the first production engine with a variable compression ratio was introduced in 2019 a high compression ratio is desirable because it allows an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of air fuel mixture due to its higher thermal efficiency this occurs because internal combustion engines are heat engines and higher compression ratios permit the same combustion temperature to be reached with less fuel while giving a longer expansion cycle creating more mechanical power output and lowering the exhaust temperature in production gasoline petrol engines from the past 20 years compression ratios are typically between 8 1 and 12 1 several production engines have used higher compression ratios including when forced induction e g a turbocharger or supercharger is used the compression ratio is often lower than naturally aspirated engines this is due to the turbocharger supercharger already having

with increasing voltage and current the electric field is trying to align the long molecular axis of the lc perpendicular to the field while the ion transport through the layer has the tendency to align the lc perpendicular to the substrate plates as a result a striped repetitive pattern is generated in the cell of which the building blocks are named williams domains upon further increase of the voltage this regular pattern is replaced by a turbulent state which is strongly scattering light this effect belongs to the class of electro hydrodynamic effects in lcs electro optic displays can be realized with that effect in the transmissive and reflective mode of operation the driving voltages required for light scattering are in the range of several ten volts and the non trivial current is depending on the area of the activated segments the dms effect was thus not suited for battery powered electronic devices

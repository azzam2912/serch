they are commonly used in binoculars and some telescopes for this purpose the prism is named after ernst abbe and albert koenig the prism is made from two glass prisms which are optically cemented together to form a symmetric shallow vee shaped assembly light enters one face at normal incidence is internally reflected from a 30 sloped face and then is reflected from a roof german dach section consisting of two faces meeting at a 90 angle at the bottom of the prism the light is then reflected from the opposite 30 face and exits again at normal incidence the net effect of the internal reflections is to flip the image both vertically and horizontally this produces a 180 image rotation without changing the image s handedness and allows use of the prism as an image erecting system unlike the more common double porro prism configuration the abbe koenig prism does not displace the output beam from the input beam making it advantageous in some instruments the prism is also less bulky than the double porro design the prism is sometimes simply called a roof prism although this is ambiguous because other roof prisms exist such as the amici and

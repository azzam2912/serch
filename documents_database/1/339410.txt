for example the venus flytrap closes its trap in about 100 milliseconds the dogwood bunchberry s flower opens its petals and fires pollen in less than 0 5 milliseconds the record is currently held by the white mulberry tree with flower movement taking 25 microseconds as pollen is catapulted from the stamens at velocities in excess of half the speed of sound near the theoretical physical limits for movements in plants these rapid plant movements differ from the more common but much slower growth movements of plants called tropisms tropisms encompass movements that lead to physical permanent alterations of the plant while rapid plant movements are usually reversible or occur at over a shorter span of time a variety of mechanisms are utilized by plants in order to achieve these fast movements extremely fast movements such as the explosive spore dispersal techniques of sphagnum mosses may involve increasing internal pressure via dehydration causing a sudden propulsion of spores up or through the rapid opening of the flower opening triggered by insect pollination fast movement can also be expressed in predatory plants where the mechanical stimulation of insect movement creates an electrical action potential and a release of elastic energy within

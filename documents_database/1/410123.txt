in other words if formula 3 is a prewellordering on a set formula 4 and if we define formula 5 by then formula 5 is an equivalence relation on formula 4 and formula 3 induces a wellordering on the quotient formula 10 the order type of this induced wellordering is an ordinal referred to as the length of the prewellordering a norm on a set formula 4 is a map from formula 4 into the ordinals every norm induces a prewellordering if formula 13 is a norm the associated prewellordering is given by conversely every prewellordering is induced by a unique regular norm a norm formula 13 is regular if for any formula 16 and any formula 17 there is formula 18 such that formula 19 if formula 20 is a pointclass of subsets of some collection formula 21 of polish spaces formula 21 closed under cartesian product and if formula 3 is a prewellordering of some subset formula 24 of some element formula 4 of formula 21 then formula 3 is said to be a formula 20 prewellordering of formula 24 if the relations formula 30 and formula 31 are elements of formula 20 where for formula 33 formula

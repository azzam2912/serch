the family includes the largest of all damselfly species they specialize in preying on web building spiders and breed in phytotelmata the small bodies of water held by plants such as bromeliads the species traditionally placed in pseudostigmatidae are all neotropical two range as far as northeastern mexico mecistogaster ornata occurs in tamaulipas and pseudostigma aberrans in both tamaulipas and nuevo le n in 2006 molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the african damselfly coryphagrion grandis previously often classified within megapodagrionidae or in a monotypic family coryphagrionidae belonged within family pseudostigmatidae close to genus mecistogaster as was proposed already ten years before this finding suggests that the family dates back to before the breakup of the supercontinent gondwana more recent studies using a denser taxon sampling have shown this family was paraphyletic and that c grandis and new world taxa have rather followed a fantastic ecomorphological convergent evolution as with other damselflies the young known as naiads nymphs or larvae have gills and live in fresh water the tropical forests where pseudostigmatids live typically have few ponds and lakes so the water that collects in or on plants is an important habitat water filled tree holes and bromeliad tanks are the

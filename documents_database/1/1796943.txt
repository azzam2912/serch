typically the thin layers to reflect high energy x rays are on the inside since low energy x rays are absorbed more readily one model used is a power law distribution of thicknesses with the thickness of the ith bilayer as a b i c for some optimised a b c an optimum multilayer design depends on the graze angle so ideally a different prescription would be used on each shell of a multi shell x ray wolter mirror in practice the same prescription is used for about ten shells characterising such coatings requires a synchrotron as a variable wavelength x ray source the danish space research institute in copenhagen is in 2012 the world centre of excellence for such coatings though a good deal of the earlier research and development was done in russia christensen fe craig ww windt dl jimenez garate ma hailey cj harrison fa mao ph chakan jm ziegler e honkimaki v measured reflectance of graded multilayer mirrors designed for astronomical hard x ray telescopes nuclear instruments methods in physics research section a accelerators spectrometers detectors and associated equipment volume 451 issue 3 pages 572 581 published sep 11 2000

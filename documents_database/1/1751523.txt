two nuclides that have the same mass number isobars can both be stable only if their atomic numbers differ by more than one in fact for currently observationally stable nuclides the difference can only be 2 or 4 and in theory two nuclides that have the same mass number cannot be both stable at least to beta decay or double beta decay but many such nuclides which are theoretically unstable to double beta decay have not been observed to decay e g xe however this rule cannot make predictions on the half lives of these radioisotopes a consequence of this rule is that technetium and promethium both have no stable isotopes as each of the neighboring elements on the periodic table molybdenum and ruthenium and neodymium and samarium respectively have a stable isotope for each mass number for the range in which the isotopes of the unstable elements usually would be stable to beta decay note that although sm is unstable it is stable to beta decay thus 147 is not a counterexample these ranges can be calculated using the liquid drop model for example the stability of technetium isotopes in which the isobar with the lowest mass excess or

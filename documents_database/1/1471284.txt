the concept was first discussed in science fiction notably in the book imperial earth by arthur c clarke and in the work of charles sheffield in which energy extracted from a kerr newman black hole is described as powering the rocket engines in the story killing vector 1978 in a more detailed analysis a proposal to create an artificial black hole and using a parabolic reflector to reflect its hawking radiation was discussed in 2009 by louis crane and shawn westmoreland their conclusion was that it was on the edge of possibility but that quantum gravity effects that are presently unknown will either make it easier or make it impossible similar concepts were also sketched out by bolonkin although beyond current technological capabilities a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods for example in nuclear fusion or fission only a small proportion of the mass is converted into energy so enormous quantities of material would be needed thus a nuclear starship would greatly deplete earth of fissile and fusile material one possibility is antimatter but the manufacturing of antimatter is hugely energy inefficient and antimatter is difficult to contain the crane and westmoreland paper states according

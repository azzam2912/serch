it has many practical open loop and closed loop control applications and is relevant to analyzing many fundamental steady state closed loop system properties such as stability and robustness given a linear time invariant lti system represented by a nonsingular matrix formula 1 the relative gain array rga is defined as where formula 3 is the elementwise hadamard product of the two matrices and the transpose operator no conjugate is necessary even for complex formula 1 each formula 5 element formula 6 gives a scale invariant unit invariant measure of the dependence of output formula 7 on input formula 8 the following are some of the linear algebra properties of the rga the second property says that the rga is invariant with respect to nonzero scalings of the rows and columns of formula 1 which is why the rga is invariant with respect to the choice of units on different input and output variables the third property says that the rga is consistent with respect to permutations of the rows or columns of formula 1 the rga is often generalized in practice to be used when formula 1 is singular e g non square by replacing the inverse of formula

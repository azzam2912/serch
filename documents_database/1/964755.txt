in java objects are manipulated through reference variables and there is no operator for copying an object the assignment operator duplicates the reference not the object the clone method provides this missing functionality classes that want copying functionality must implement some method to do so to a certain extent that function is provided by codice 2 codice 1 acts like a copy constructor typically it calls the codice 1 method of its superclass to obtain the copy etc until it eventually reaches codice 5 s codice 1 method the special codice 1 method in the base class codice 5 provides a standard mechanism for duplicating objects the class codice 5 s codice 1 method creates and returns a copy of the object with the same class and with all the fields having the same values however codice 2 throws a codice 12 unless the object is an instance of a class that implements the marker interface codice 13 the default implementation of codice 2 performs a shallow copy when a class desires a deep copy or some other custom behavior they must implement that in their own codice 1 method after they obtain the copy from the superclass the syntax

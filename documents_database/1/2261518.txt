one vegetation type is coniferous shrubbery characterised by the gymnosperm species microcachrys tetragona pherosphaera hookeriana podocarpus lawrencei and diselma archeri distribution of these species is relevant with abiotic factors including edaphic conditions and fire frequency and increasingly the threat of climate change towards species survival exists conservation and management of coniferous shrubbery are necessary considering that the paleoendemic species microcachrys pherosphaera and diselma have persisted in western tasmanian environments for millions of years these coniferous shrub species are restricted to subalpine and alpine heathlands in western tasmania with the exception of podocarpus lawrencei which lives on the mainland the alpine environments where these conifers occur have high levels of conifer endemism which is an ecologically habitat for coniferous shrub species coniferous shrub species can be observed in mount field national park in tasmania s south west along the tarn shelf all species can be observed in rocky environments with shallow soil above 1 000 meters both the alpine environment and the harsh maritime climate have the pressures and limitations of wind exposure and ice abrasion for the woody and shrub like habit of coniferous shrubbery the lack of protective snow cover on tasmanian mountains means that vegetation must be mechanically

olsr is a proactive link state routing protocol which uses hello and topology control tc messages to discover and then disseminate link state information throughout the mobile ad hoc network individual nodes use this topology information to compute next hop destinations for all nodes in the network using shortest hop forwarding paths link state routing protocols such as open shortest path first ospf and intermediate system to intermediate system is is elect a designated router on every link to perform flooding of topology information in wireless ad hoc networks there is different notion of a link packets can and do go out the same interface hence a different approach is needed in order to optimize the flooding process using hello messages the olsr protocol at each node discovers 2 hop neighbor information and performs a distributed election of a set of multipoint relays mprs nodes select mprs such that there exists a path to each of its 2 hop neighbors via a node selected as an mpr these mpr nodes then source and forward tc messages that contain the mpr selectors this functioning of mprs makes olsr unique from other link state routing protocols in a few different ways the

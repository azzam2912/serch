this can be expressed as where v is the normalization constant in volts and k is the scale factor the logarithm amplifier gives an output voltage which is proportional to the logarithm of applied input voltage to design a logarithm amplifier circuit high performance op amps like lm1458 lm771 lm714 are commonly used and a compensated logarithm amplifier may include more than one in some situations especially in rf domain monolithic logarithmic amplifiers are also used to reduce number of components and space used as well improve bandwidth and noise performance logarithmic amplifiers are used in many ways such as the reverse saturation current for the diode doubles for every ten degree celsius rise in temperature similarly the emitter saturation current varies significantly from one transistor to another and also with temperature hence it is very difficult to set the reference voltage for the circuit the relationship between the input voltage formula 2 and the output voltage formula 3 is given by where formula 5 and formula 6 are the saturation current and the thermal voltage of the diode respectively a necessary condition for successful operation of a log amplifier is that the input voltage v is always positive this

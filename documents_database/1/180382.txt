it can also serve as a reversing gear it is sometimes referred to as the motion in the simple case this can be a relatively simple task as in the internal combustion engine in which the valves always open and close at the same points this is not the ideal arrangement for a steam engine though because greatest power is achieved by keeping the inlet valve open throughout the power stroke thus having full boiler pressure minus transmission losses against the piston throughout the stroke while peak efficiency is achieved by only having the inlet valve open for a short time and then letting the steam expand in the cylinder expansive working the point at which steam stops being admitted to the cylinder is known as the cutoff and the optimal position for this varies depending on the work being done and the tradeoff desired between power and efficiency steam engines are fitted with regulators throttles in us parlance to vary the restriction on steam flow but controlling the power via the cutoff setting is generally preferable since it makes for more efficient use of boiler steam a further benefit may be obtained by admitting the steam to the cylinder

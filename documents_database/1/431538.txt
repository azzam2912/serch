in this cyclic compound the three bh units and three nh units alternate the compound is isoelectronic and isostructural with benzene for this reason borazine is sometimes referred to as inorganic benzene like benzene borazine is a colourless liquid the compound was reported in 1926 by the chemists alfred stock and erich pohland by a reaction of diborane with ammonia borazine is synthesized from diborane and ammonia in a 1 2 ratio at 250 300 c with a conversion of 50 an alternative more efficient route begins with lithium borohydride and ammonium chloride in a two step process to borazine boron trichloride is first converted to trichloroborazine the b cl bonds are subsequently converted to b h bonds borazine is a colourless liquid with an aromatic smell in water it hydrolyzes to boric acid ammonia and hydrogen borazine with a standard enthalpy change of formation h of 531 kj mol is thermally very stable borazine is isoelectronic with benzene and has similar connectivity so it is sometimes referred to as inorganic benzene this comparison is not rigorously valid due to the electronegativity difference between boron and nitrogen x ray crystallographic structural determinations show that the bond lengths within the borazine

then in 1996 macallister at st george s hospital medical school in london recognised that inhibiting the enzyme ddah increases intracellular concentrations of adma to describe the process of protein turnover the elimination of free methylated arginine derivatives and the catabolism of the two asymmetrically methylated arginine derivatives adma and l nmma the australian physician trevor tingate coined the term protein detoxification in 2010 protein arginine methylation occurs posttranslationally and is catalysed by protein arginine methyltransferase prmt no direct synthesis of methylated arginine derivatives occurs from the free amino acid the methylation of protein arginine plays an important role in the regulation of many cell processes including gene transcription cell signal transduction dna repair and rna processing during protein turnover three arginine methylated derivatives are released l nmma sdma and adma around 60 mg of adma is produced per day unlike sdma 80 of adma and nmma is catabolised by the enzyme ddah the activity of ddah is therefore an important determinant of adma and nmma levels and thus nos activity protein arginine methyltransferase s prmts are activated by shear stress and ldl cholesterol two types of pmrts have been characterised dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase ddah activity is inhibited by no reactive

the embodiment of the network is often physical or informational an entropy network is composed of entropy containers which are often called nodes elements features or regions and entropy transfer occurs between containers the transfer of entropy in networks was characterized by schreiber in his transfer entropy a discrete physical basis for entropy networks can be found in the observation and discussions of discrete observations appear briefly in the work of prokopenko lizier price more complete discussions of observations were offered by leo szil rd and l on brillouin network motifs have been proposed to be scale independent networks have been classified by total entropy the entropy content of graphs has been considered throughout fields of math and computer science design of entropy networks and in depth investigation has been publicized by wissner gross and freer who have proposed a time entropy relation where entropy is maximized of a lifespan through which predictions of the emergence of complexity can be shown the role of entropy networks in formation of structures is critical in engineering and its physical implications determine chirality organize biological molecules and quantify the topologies of condensed matter mass networks

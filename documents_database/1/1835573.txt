it was shot near bacchus marsh maldon in victoria cox called the movie minimal filmmaking it s the very first time i read a book that i wanted to film because i normally don t believe the film has much to do with the novel i wasn t at the screening at the melbourne film festival but i never want to screen a film at a festival again that screening actually killed the release it got bad reviews in a few places so roadshow wouldn t even release it i think that as an australian bush film it is a very very original film a highly original piece the forest the beauty of the land that s the altar and the sacrifice is the innocence and youth you have a sacrifice on an altar but it gave me enormous satisfaction because the finished film is very nicely tuned minimal when you look at the way it s crafted but that s not what the reviewers want a bush film like this that s not very australian is it

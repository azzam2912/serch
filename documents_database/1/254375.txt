this indigo blue mineral is commonly a secondary mineral in limited abundance and although it is not an important ore of copper itself it is well known to mineral collectors the mineral is generally found in zones of secondary enrichment supergene of copper sulfide deposits commonly found as coatings on chalcocite chalcopyrite bornite enargite pyrite and other sulfides it often occurs as pseudomorphic replacements of other minerals the first records are from mount vesuvius formally named in 1832 after n covelli research of its unique properties has only surged in past decade yet promising results suggest may be used widescale in certain specific applications in the future covellite belongs to the binary copper sulfides group which has the formula cus and can have a wide ranging copper sulfur ratio from 1 2 to 2 1 cu s however this series is by no means continuous and the homogeneity range of covellite cus is narrow materials rich in sulfur cus where x 1 1 1 2 do exist but they exhibit superstructures a modulation of the hexagonal ground plane of the structure spanning a number of adjacent unit cells this indicates that several of covellite s special properties are the result

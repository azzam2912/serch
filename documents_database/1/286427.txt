the complications are hepatic encephalopathy and impaired protein synthesis as measured by the levels of serum albumin and the prothrombin time in the blood the 1993 classification defines hyperacute as within 1 week acute as 8 28 days and subacute as 4 12 weeks it reflects the fact that the pace of disease evolution strongly influences prognosis underlying cause is the other significant determinant of outcome the main features of acute liver failure are rapid onset jaundice weakness and eventually changes in mental status that can begin as mild confusion but progress to coma in alf hepatic encephalopathy leads to cerebral edema coma brain herniation and eventually death detection of encephalopathy is central to the diagnosis of alf it may vary from subtle deficit in higher brain function e g mood concentration in grade i to deep coma grade iv patients presenting as acute and hyperacute liver failure are at greater risk of developing cerebral oedema and grade iv encephalopathy the pathogenesis remains unclear but is likely to be a consequence of several phenomena there is a buildup of toxic substances like ammonia mercaptan benzodiazepines serotonin and tryptophan in the brain this affects neurotransmitter level and neuroreceptor activation autoregulation of

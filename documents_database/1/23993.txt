a familiar example is the generation of light by an electron beam scanning the phosphor coated inner surface of the screen of a television that uses a cathode ray tube cathodoluminescence is the inverse of the photoelectric effect in which electron emission is induced by irradiation with photons luminescence in a semiconductor results when an electron in the conduction band recombines with a hole in the valence band the difference energy band gap of this transition can be emitted in form of a photon the energy color of the photon and the probability that a photon and not a phonon will be emitted depends on the material its purity and the presence of defects first the electron has to be excited from the valence band into the conduction band in cathodoluminescence this occurs as the result of an impinging high energy electron beam onto a semiconductor however these primary electrons carry far too much energy to directly excite electrons instead the inelastic scattering of the primary electrons in the crystal leads to the emission of secondary electrons auger electrons and x rays which in turn can scatter as well such a cascade of scattering events leads to up to 10

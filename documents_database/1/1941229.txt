there is evidence to suggest that the post copulatory guarding exhibited by gerris buenoi and other species of gerris is a form of a direct material benefit that females take advantage of to reduce superfluous matings male persistence is often detrimental to female fitness as male species of gerris harass females this is believed to be the result of males having a lower number of available mates and therefore have a reduced fitness females are at risk of predation during mating attempts as males mount the female in an attempt to mate and tap their legs on the surface of the water to attract predators females respond in turn creating a pre copulatory struggle in which they try to perform backwards somersault like movements to break free of the male grapple if unsuccessful female species of gerris will resort to mating with the male as the cost of rejecting the male advances death by predation outweighs the cost of mating out of convenience as a result of the tactics employed by both species there is evidence of rapid evolution between the sexes in a persistence resistance form of sexual conflict the sexes of species of genus gerris compete between each

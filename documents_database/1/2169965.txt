dirac s original motivation was to explain the mass of the muon as an excitation of the ground state corresponding to an electron anticipating the birth of string theory by almost a decade he was the first to introduce what is now called a type of nambu goto action for membranes in the dirac membrane model the repulsive electromagnetic forces on the membrane are balanced by the contracting ones coming from the positive tension in the case of the spherical membrane classical equations of motion imply that the balance is met for the radius formula 1 where formula 2 is the classical electron radius using bohr sommerfeld quantisation condition for the hamiltonian of the spherically symmetric membrane dirac finds the approximation of the mass corresponding to the first excitation as formula 3 where formula 4 is the mass of the electron which is about a quarter of the observed muon mass dirac chose a non standard way to formulate the action principle for the membrane because closed membranes in formula 5 provide a natural split of space into the interior and the exterior there exists a special curvilinear system of coordinates formula 6 in spacetime and a function formula 7

optical modules typically have an electrical interface on the side that connects to the inside of the system and an optical interface on the side that connects to the outside world through a fiber optic cable the form factor and electrical interface are often specified by an interested group using a multi source agreement msa optical modules can either plug into a front panel socket or an on board socket sometimes the optical module is replaced by an electrical interface module that implements either an active or passive electrical connection to the outside world a large industry supports the manufacturing and use of optical modules there have been multiple variants of the electrical interface of optical modules that have been used over the years the earliest forms of optical modules had an analog nrz electrical interface in the transmit direction the optical module would directly drive the laser or led with the analog signal coming from the front system card in the receive direction the module would directly drive the receive electrical interface with the output of the analog optical to electrical receiver circuit as speeds increased the electrical interface was changed to a retimed digital interface the common electrical

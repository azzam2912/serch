dna methylation was the first discovered epigenetic mark and remains the most studied in animals it predominantly involves the addition of a methyl group to the carbon 5 position of cytosine residues of the dinucleotide cpg and is implicated in repression of transcriptional activity treatment of dna with bisulfite converts cytosine residues to uracil but leaves 5 methylcytosine residues unaffected therefore dna that has been treated with bisulfite retains only methylated cytosines thus bisulfite treatment introduces specific changes in the dna sequence that depend on the methylation status of individual cytosine residues yielding single nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of dna various analyses can be performed on the altered sequence to retrieve this information the objective of this analysis is therefore reduced to differentiating between single nucleotide polymorphisms cytosines and thymidine resulting from bisulfite conversion figure 1 bisulfite sequencing applies routine sequencing methods on bisulfite treated genomic dna to determine methylation status at cpg dinucleotides other non sequencing strategies are also employed to interrogate the methylation at specific loci or at a genome wide level all strategies assume that bisulfite induced conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil is complete and this serves as the basis

the reconnection marks the beginning of the zanclean age according to this model water from the atlantic ocean refilled the dried up basin through the modern day strait of gibraltar the mediterranean basin flooded mostly during a period estimated to have been between several months and two years sea level rise in the basin may have reached rates at times greater than based on the erosion features preserved until modern times under the pliocene sediment garcia castellanos et al estimate that water rushed down a drop of more than with a discharge of up to about 1 000 times that of the present day amazon river studies of the underground structures at the gibraltar strait show that the flooding channel descended gradually toward the bottom of the basin rather than forming a steep waterfall not all scientific studies have agreed with the catastrophist interpretation of this event some researchers have estimated that the reinstallment of a normal mediterranean sea basin following the messinian lago mare episode took place much more slowly taking as long as 10 000 years the geologic history of the mediterranean is governed by plate tectonics involving the african plate the arabian plate and the eurasian plate

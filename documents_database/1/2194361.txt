it is considered a member of the stellar cygnus ob1 association and within it the open cluster berkeley 87 2 which would place at a distance of 1 500 parsecs 4 890 light years of the solar system however according to the measure of the parallax by the satellite hipparcos 1 20 milliarcseconds it is less than a degree north of another variable red supergiant bi cygni bc cygni was calculated to have an effective temperature of 2 858 to 3 614 k and to vary between the size at its brightest and coolest has been calculated to be compared to at the hottest and faintest it is one of largest stars known if it were in the place of the sun its photosphere would engulf the orbit of jupiter assuming the maximum radius of with a mass of about it is estimated that the stellar mass loss as dust as the atomic and molecular gas could not be evaluators is per year this mass is an indication that this star will end up exploding as a supernova the brightness of bc cyg varies from visual magnitude 9 0 and 10 8 with a period of 720 40 days between

such a reactor needs no neutron moderator but requires fuel that is relatively rich in fissile material when compared to that required for a thermal neutron reactor natural uranium consists mostly of three isotopes and trace quantities of a decay product of accounts for roughly 99 3 of natural uranium and undergoes fission only by fast neutrons about 0 7 of natural uranium is which undergoes fission by neutrons of any energy but particularly by lower energy neutrons when either of these isotopes undergoes fission it releases neutrons with an energy distribution peaking around 1 to 2 mev the flux of higher energy fission neutrons 2 mev is too low to create sufficient fission in and the flux of lower energy fission neutrons neutron moderator which interacts with the neutrons to slow them the most common moderator is water which acts by elastic scattering until the neutrons reach thermal equilibrium with the water the key to reactor design is to carefully lay out the fuel and water so the neutrons have time to slow enough to become highly reactive with the but not so far as to allow them to escape the reactor core although does not undergo fission by

can form a superlattice with gallium arsenide which results in its semiconductor properties because and have almost the same lattice constant the layers have very little induced strain which allows them to be grown almost arbitrarily thick this allows for extremely high performance high electron mobility hemt transistors and other quantum well devices it has the following properties aluminum arsenide is a iii v compound semiconductor material and is an advantageous material for the manufacture of optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes aluminum arsenide can be prepared using well known methods such as liquid and vapor phase epitaxy techniques or melt growth techniques however aluminum arsenide crystals prepared by these methods are generally unstable and generate arsine ash when exposed to moist air little work has been reported on the preparation of aluminum arsenide mainly because of the practical difficulties involved preparation from the melt is difficult because of the high melting point of the compound about 1 700 c and of the extreme reactivity of aluminum at this temperature a few workers have prepared small crystals from the melt and polycrystalline ingots have also been produced the best of this material has an impurity carrier density of the

it is given its name because several streets in cairo are paved in this design it is one of 15 known monohedral pentagon tilings it is also called macmahon s net after percy alexander macmahon and his 1921 publication new mathematical pastimes conway calls it a 4 fold pentille as a 2 dimensional crystal net it shares a special feature with the honeycomb net both nets are examples of standard realization the notion introduced by m kotani and t sunada for general crystal nets these are not regular pentagons their sides are not equal they have four long ones and one short one in the ratio 1 sqrt 3 1 and their angles in sequence are 120 120 90 120 90 it is represented by with face configuration v3 3 4 3 4 it is similar to the prismatic pentagonal tiling with face configuration v3 3 3 4 4 which has its right angles adjacent to each other the cairo pentagonal tiling has two lower symmetry forms given as monohedral pentagonal tilings types 4 and 8 it is the dual of the snub square tiling made of two squares and three equilateral triangles around each vertex this tiling can be

e g if a compound is so similar to one of the reactants that it can bind to the active site of a catalyst but does not undergo a catalytic reaction then that catalyst molecule cannot perform its job because the active site is occupied when the inhibitor is released the catalyst is again available for reaction inhibition should be distinguished from catalyst poisoning an inhibitor only hinders the working of a catalyst without changing it whilst in catalyst poisoning the catalyst undergoes a chemical reaction that is irreversible in the environment in question the active catalyst may only be regained by a separate process index inhibitors or simplified as inhibitor predictably inhibit metabolism via a given pathway and are commonly used in prospective clinical drug drug interaction studies inhibitors of cyp can be classified by their potency such as

the molecule is adsorbed onto a copper 111 single crystal piece by chemisorption the motor the world s smallest electric motor is just a nanometer billionth of a meter across 60 000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair it was developed by chemists at the tufts university school of arts and sciences and published online september 4 2011 single molecule motors have been demonstrated before these motors were either powered by chemical reactions or by light this is the first experimental demonstration of electrical energy successfully coupling to directed molecular rotation butyl methyl sulfide is an asymmetrical thioether which is achiral in the gas phase the molecule can adsorbed to the surface through either of the sulfur s two lone pair this gives rise to the surface bound chirality of the molecule the asymmetry of the molecular surface interface gives rise to an asymmetrical barrier to rotation the molecule rotates around this sulfur copper bond electrons quantum tunneling from the stm tip electrically excite molecular vibrations which couple to rotational modes the rotation of the motor can be controlled by adjusting the electron flux from the scanning tunneling microscope and the background temperature the tip of the

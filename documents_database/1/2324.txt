this formula holds true for monosaccharides some exceptions exist for example deoxyribose a sugar component of dna has the empirical formula cho the carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon structurally it is more accurate to view them as aldoses and ketoses the term is most common in biochemistry where it is a synonym of saccharide a group that includes sugars starch and cellulose the saccharides are divided into four chemical groups monosaccharides disaccharides oligosaccharides and polysaccharides monosaccharides and disaccharides the smallest lower molecular weight carbohydrates are commonly referred to as sugars the word saccharide comes from the greek word s kkharon meaning sugar while the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix ose as in the monosaccharides fructose fruit sugar and glucose starch sugar and the disaccharides sucrose cane or beet sugar and lactose milk sugar carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms polysaccharides serve for the storage of energy e g starch and glycogen and as structural components e g cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods the 5 carbon monosaccharide ribose is an important component of coenzymes e g atp fad and nad and the backbone

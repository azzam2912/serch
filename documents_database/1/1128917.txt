featuring hancock s arrangements for an unusual front line of alto flute bass trombone and flugelhorn the album was described by critic nat hentoff as an impressive further stage in the evolution of herbie hancock as writer and player characterised by a singular quality of incisive searching lyricism none of the wind players perform solos on any song the cover photograph was taken by david bythewood an acquaintance of hancock the photo depicts hancock in silhouette kissing his then girlfriend gigi meixner the pianist wanted to represent here a childlike but not childish philosophy he felt this music didn t reflect the social turmoil of the late 1960s in america that is riots and problematic economy hancock rather wanted to picture a more upbeat brighter future or as he says a forward look into what could be a bright future more so hancock wanted to go back and rediscover certain childhood qualities we lose and wish we could have back purity spontaneity when they do return to us we re at our best therefore speak like a child translates as think and feel in terms of hope and the possibilities of making our future less impure in the liner notes

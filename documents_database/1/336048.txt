this has led to substantial development of statistical theory related to the problem of optimal estimation while combining the constraint of unbiasedness with the desirability metric of least variance leads to good results in most practical settings making mvue a natural starting point for a broad range of analyses a targeted specification may perform better for a given problem thus mvue is not always the best stopping point consider estimation of formula 1 based on data formula 2 i i d from some member of a family of densities formula 3 where formula 4 is the parameter space an unbiased estimator formula 5 of formula 6 is umvue if formula 7 for any other unbiased estimator formula 9 if an unbiased estimator of formula 6 exists then one can prove there is an essentially unique mvue using the rao blackwell theorem one can also prove that determining the mvue is simply a matter of finding a complete sufficient statistic for the family formula 11 and conditioning any unbiased estimator on it further by the lehmann scheff theorem an unbiased estimator that is a function of a complete sufficient statistic is the umvue estimator put formally suppose formula 5 is unbiased

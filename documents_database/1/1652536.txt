the shear strength of a discontinuity is often considerably lower than the shear strength of the blocks of intact material in between the discontinuities and therefore influences for example tunnel foundation or slope engineering but also the stability of natural slopes many slopes natural and man made fail due to a low shear strength of discontinuities in the soil or rock mass in the slope the deformation characteristics of a soil or rock mass are also influenced by the shear strength of the discontinuities for example the modulus of deformation is reduced and the deformation becomes plastic i e non reversible deformation on reduction of stress rather than elastic i e reversible deformation this may cause for example larger settlement of foundations which is also permanent even if the load is only temporary furthermore the shear strength of discontinuities influences the stress distribution in a soil or rock mass the shear strength along a discontinuity in a soil or rock mass in geotechnical engineering is governed by the persistence of the discontinuity roughness of discontinuity surfaces infill material in the discontinuity presence and pressure of gasses and fluids e g water oil and possible solution e g karst and cementation

this contact is usually made with some form of mechanical probe a set of mechanical probes will often be arranged together on a probe card which is attached to the wafer prober the wafer is lifted by the wafer prober until metal pads on one or more ics on the wafer make physical contact with the probes a certain amount of over travel is required after the first probe makes contact with the wafer for two reasons there are numerous types of mechanical probes available commercially their shape can be in the form of a cantilever spring or membrane and they can be bent into shape stamped or made by microelectromechanical systems processing using mechanical probes has certain drawbacks alternatives to mechanical probing of ics have been explored by various groups slupsky moore scanimetrics kuroda these methods use tiny rf antennae similar to rfid tags but on a much smaller scale to replace both the mechanical probes and the metal probe pads if the antennae on the probe card and ic are properly aligned then a transmitter on the probe card can send data wirelessly to the receiver on the ic via rf communication this method has several advantages

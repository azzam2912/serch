the theorem establishes the existence of principal curvatures and associated principal directions which give the directions in which the surface curves the most and the least the theorem is named for leonhard euler who proved the theorem in more precisely let m be a surface in three dimensional euclidean space and p a point on m a normal plane through p is a plane passing through the point p containing the normal vector to m through each unit tangent vector to m at p there passes a normal plane p which cuts out a curve in m that curve has a certain curvature when regarded as a curve inside p provided not all are equal there is some unit vector x for which k is as large as possible and another unit vector x for which k is as small as possible euler s theorem asserts that x and x are perpendicular and that moreover if x is any vector making an angle with x then the quantities k and k are called the principal curvatures and x and x are the corresponding principal directions equation is sometimes called euler s equation

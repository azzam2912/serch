it preserves fossils dating back to the silurian period the sandstones and mudstones that form the outcrops along the coast from cowie to ruthery head were mostly laid down by braided rivers crossing a semi arid low relief landscape rare fossils contained in one particular layer near cowie harbour indicate that these rocks are over 428 million years old and belong to the mid silurian period one particularly exciting find was made here in 2003 when a fragment of a fossil millipede was identified as the earliest known air breathing animal in the world it is celebrated in a display board on the sea front at cowie one unusual feature of these layered sedimentary rocks is that they have been tilted to the south east at a very steep angle and therefore are seen edge on in the outcrops on the foreshore and is formally known as the strathmore syncline when these layers are followed south eastwards for several kilometres the degree of tilting towards the se is seen to decrease until the layers are near horizontal and then steepen again as they begin to tilt towards the nw thus defining a broad u shaped fold in the rock strata

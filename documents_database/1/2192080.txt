mtb s arduous treatment regimen and the recent emergence of increasingly drug resistant mtb strains have given rise to an urgent need for the development of new anti tubercular drugs the mycobacterial proteasome a large proteolytic complex is important for both mtb virulence and resistance to the host s antimicrobial nitric oxide response is a potential therapeutic target proteins can be targeted for proteasomal degradation in mtb by the pupylation pathway a process that is functionally analogous to eukaryotic ubiquitination pupylation centers around the small protein modifier pup prokaryotic ubiquitin like protein which is covalently ligated to a protein to target it for proteolysis despite advances in understanding of the pup proteasome system no group has yet recapitulated robust degradation of a native substrate by the mtb proteasome in vitro implying that additional unknown factors are necessary for proteasomal activity to search for such factors researchers used a catalytically in active proteasome trap that stabilizes proteasomal interactions to identify novel proteasome associated proteins in 2014 pafe copurified with the proteasome trap in high abundance and co occurs evolutionarily with the prokaryotic 20s core particle an m tuberculosis pafe mutant accumulates misfolded proteins and is unable to quickly degrade hspr resulting

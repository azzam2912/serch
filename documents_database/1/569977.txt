the perkow reaction in this respect is considered a side reaction the reaction mechanism of the perkow reaction consists of a nucleophilic addition of the phosphite at the carbonyl carbon forming a zwitterionic intermediate the zwitterionic intermediate rearranges to a cationic species while eliminating the halide the cationic species then dealkylates through a second nucleophilic displacement in which the halide anion attacks one of the phosphite alkoxide substituents forming an enol phosphate the perkow reaction has been applied in the synthesis of a novel insect repellent based on hexachloroacetone and triethylphosphite which is able to engage in a secondary 4 3 cycloaddition with furan through the action of the base sodium 2 2 2 trifluoroethoxide the authors report mediocre yields the perkow reaction is also used in the synthesis of novel quinolines when the substituent is n butyl the reaction product is the classical perkow adduct in this reaction the leaving group is an electron deficient acyl group owing to the presence of three fluorine groups when the substituent on the other hand is phenyl not shown the phosphite has a preference for reaction with the acyl group leading to an ethyl enol ether key in explaining the difference in

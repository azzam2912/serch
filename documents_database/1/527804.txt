it has a guyed mast tall bringing the antennas to a height of above sea level it was built by the independent television authority ita in 1957 and is now owned and operated by arqiva the present mast is the second to have been built at the site the first built in 1957 brought the independent television service to central scotland and opened for service on 31 august 1957 however complex anomalies in the behaviour of the antenna caused its performance to be less than predicted and the decision was taken in 1959 to replace the mast with a higher structure and a more conventional aerial on the outside of the mast rather than inside as had been the case with the first mast the original 750 foot mast was then dismantled and later used at the selkirk transmitting station in the borders where it still stands the transmitter was originally a b group but with the advent of digital two of the 6 muxes then went out of band and required an e group or wideband aerial if reception of these was required a k group or wideband aerial is now required to receive every multiplex in july 2007

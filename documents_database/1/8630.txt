the process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling mathematical models are used in the natural sciences such as physics biology earth science chemistry and engineering disciplines such as computer science electrical engineering as well as in the social sciences such as economics psychology sociology political science a model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components and to make predictions about behaviour mathematical models can take many forms including dynamical systems statistical models differential equations or game theoretic models these and other types of models can overlap with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures in general mathematical models may include logical models in many cases the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed in the physical sciences a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and variables relationships can be described by operators such as algebraic operators functions differential operators etc variables are

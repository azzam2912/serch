in stands of spruce trees of equal age that germinated in the permafrost active layer after a fire tilting begins when the trees are 50 to 100 years old suggesting that surface heaving from new permafrost aggradation can also create drunken forests permafrost which is soil or rock that remains below 0 c for at least two consecutive years forms a solid matrix in soil which can extend to a depth of hundreds of meters the permafrost prevents trees from developing deep root systems for example the black spruce that has adapted to permafrost soils has no significant taproot in areas where the permafrost temperature is near the melting point of water climate variations or loss of surface vegetation from fire flooding construction or deforestation can thaw the upper extents of the permafrost creating a thermokarst the scientific name for a ground slump caused by melting permafrost the thermokarst undermines the shallow root bed of these trees causing them to lean or fall thermokarst lakes are surrounded by a ring of drunken trees leaning toward the lake which makes these land features easily identifiable drunken trees may eventually die from their displacement and in ice rich permafrost the entire drunken

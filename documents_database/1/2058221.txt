it is sometimes said that animals create their own subjective social reality from their perception of the input in humans for example an optimistic or pessimistic bias might affect one s answer to the question is the glass half empty or half full to explore cognitive bias one might train an animal to expect that a positive event follows one stimulus and that a negative event follows another stimulus for example on many trials if the animal presses lever a after a 20 hz tone it gets a highly desired food but a press on lever b after a 10 hz tone yields bland food the animal is then offered both levers after an intermediate test stimulus e g a 15 hz tone the hypothesis is that the animal s mood will bias the choice of levers after the test stimulus if positive it will tend to choose lever a if negative it will tend to choose lever b the hypothesis is tested by manipulating factors that might affect mood for example the type of housing the animal is kept in cognitive biases have been shown in a wide range of species including rats dogs rhesus macaques sheep chicks starlings

non bonding orbitals are often designated by the letter n in molecular orbital diagrams and electron transition notations non bonding orbitals are the equivalent in molecular orbital theory of the lone pairs in lewis structures the energy level of a non bonding orbital is typically in between the lower energy of a valence shell bonding orbital and the higher energy of a corresponding antibonding orbital as such a non bonding orbital with electrons would commonly be a homo highest occupied molecular orbital according to molecular orbital theory molecular orbitals are often modeled by the linear combination of atomic orbitals in a simple diatomic molecule such as hydrogen fluoride chemical formula hf one atom may have many more electrons than the other a sigma bonding orbital is created between the atomic orbitals with like symmetry some orbitals e g p and p orbitals from the fluorine in hf may not have any other orbitals to combine with and become non bonding molecular orbitals in the hf example the p and p orbitals remain p and p orbitals in shape but when viewed as molecular orbitals are thought of as non bonding the energy of the orbital does not depend on the

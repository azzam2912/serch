the spiral arms of a grand design galaxy extend clearly around the galaxy through many radians and can be observed over a large fraction of the galaxy s radius as of 2002 approximately 10 percent of all currently known spiral galaxies are classified as grand design type spirals including m51 m74 m81 m83 and m101 density wave theory is the preferred explanation for the well defined structure of grand design spirals according to this theory the spiral arms are created inside density waves that turn around the galaxy at different speeds from the stars in the galaxy s disk stars and gas are clumped in these dense regions due to gravitational attraction towards the dense material though their location in the spiral arm may not be permanent when they come close to the spiral arm they are pulled toward the dense material by the force of gravity and as they travel through the arm they are slowed from exiting by the same gravitational pull this causes the gas in particular to clump in the dense regions which encourages gas clouds to collapse producing star formation

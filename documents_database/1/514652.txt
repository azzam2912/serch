writers broadly agree that the width of the pale ranges from about one fifth to about one third of the width of the shield but this width is not fixed a narrow pale is more likely if it is uncharged that is if it does not have other objects placed on it if charged the pale is typically wider to allow room for the objects drawn there the pale is one of the ordinaries in heraldry along with the bend chevron fess and chief there are several other ordinaries and sub ordinaries the word pale originally referred to a picket a piece of wood much taller than it is wide such as is used to build a picket fence and it is from the resemblance to this that the heraldic pale derives its name a pale may be couped cut off at either end and so not reaching the top or bottom of the shield however while other charges if couped at the top would just be blazoned as couped in chief the special term for this in the case of the pale is a pale retrait this also applies to pallets see below if couped at the bottom it

as in high dynamic range imaging hdri or just hdr the goal is to capture a scene with a higher dynamic range than the camera is capable of capturing with a single exposure by using different exposure parameters on the same scene a wider dynamic range can be represented and later merged into an image with better dynamic range after correcting for small shifts that may inadvently happen with hand held devices the full image can be fused in two ways the former method assumes a linear response from the camera which may be provided by dng or other raw formats some variants can take developed images but the process of reconstructing the intensities is complicated and noisy compromising the effective dynamic range the latter method mertens kautz van reeth mkvr only cares about aligning features and taking the best parts automatically by contrast saturation and well exposedness or manually so it is immune to this drawback however it cannot be considered a true hdr technique because no hdr image is ever created the image does look better on displays but the resulting bit depth of the image is equal to the input depth unlike on a true hdr image

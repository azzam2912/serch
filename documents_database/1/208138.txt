however as writes in his review of a book about combinatorial proofs these two simple techniques are enough to prove many theorems in combinatorics and number theory an archetypal double counting proof is for the well known formula for the number formula 1 of k combinations i e subsets of size k of an n element set here a direct bijective proof is not possible because the right hand side of the identity is a fraction there is no set obviously counted by it it even takes some thought to see that the denominator always evenly divides the numerator however its numerator counts the cartesian product of k finite sets of sizes n while its denominator counts the permutations of a k element set the set most obviously counted by the denominator would be another cartesian product k finite sets if desired one could map permutations to that set by an explicit bijection now take s to be the set of sequences of k elements selected from our n element set without repetition on one hand there is an easy bijection of s with the cartesian product corresponding to the numerator formula 3 and on the other hand there is

measurable quantities such as position momentum and energy are all derived from the wavefunction formula 1 where formula 2 is the reduced planck constant formula 3 is the mass of the particle formula 4 is the imaginary unit and formula 5 is time one peculiar potential that can be solved exactly is when the electric quadrupole moment is the dominant term of an infinitely long cylinder of charge it can be shown that the schr dinger equation is solvable for a cylindrically symmetric electric quadrupole thus indicating that the quadrupole term of an infinitely long cylinder can be quantized in the physics of classical electrodynamics it can be easily shown that the scalar potential and associated mechanical potential energy of a cylindrically symmetric quadrupole is as follows cylindrical symmetry should be used when solving the equation the time independent schr dinger equation becomes the following in cylindrical symmetry formula 8 using the technique separation of variables the above equation can be written as two ordinary differential equations in both the radial and azimuthal directions the radial equation is bessel s equation as can be seen below if one changes variables to formula 9 bessel s equation is exactly obtained formula

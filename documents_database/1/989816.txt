proved a similar theorem for semisimple p adic groups a distribution on a group g or its lie algebra is called invariant if it is invariant under conjugation by g a distribution on a group g or its lie algebra is called an eigendistribution if it is an eigenvector of the center of the universal enveloping algebra of g identified with the left and right invariant differential operators of g harish chandra s regularity theorem states that any invariant eigendistribution on a semisimple group or lie algebra is a locally integrable function the condition that it is an eigendistribution can be relaxed slightly to the condition that its image under the center of the universal enveloping algebra is finite dimensional the regularity theorem also implies that on each cartan subalgebra the distribution can be written as a finite sum of exponentials divided by a function that closely resembles the denominator of the weyl character formula harish chandra s original proof of the regularity theorem is given in a sequence of five papers most proofs can be broken up into several steps as follows

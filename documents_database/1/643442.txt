a 128 bit variant was submitted as an estream cipher candidate and has been selected as one of the four final contestants in the software profile the algorithm is designed by hongjun wu and was first published in 2004 it is not patented hc 256 has a 256 bit key and an initialization vector nonce of 256 bits internally it consists of two secret tables p and q each table contains 1024 32 bit words for each state update one 32 bit word in each table is updated using a non linear update function after 2048 steps all elements of the tables have been updated it generates one 32 bit word for each update step using a 32 bit to 32 bit mapping function similar to the output function of the blowfish cipher finally a linear bit masking function is applied to generate an output word it uses the two message schedule functions in the hash function sha 256 internally but with the tables p and q as s boxes hc 128 is similar in function and reduces each of key length nonce number of words in the tables p and q and number of table updating steps by half

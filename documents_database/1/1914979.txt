from early times and particularly in medieval europe the consumption of grains containing ergot has repeatedly lead to mass poisonings known as ergotism which was caused by toxic ergot alkaloids and mycotoxins such as the ergochromes due to contamination of flour by c purpurea a cluster of genes responsible for the synthesis of secalonic acids in c purpurea has been identified secalonic acid d the enantiomer of secalonic acid a is a major environmental toxin isolated from the fungus penicillium oxalicum and is a major microbial contaminant of freshly harvested corn which causes toxicity through contamination of foodstuffs in addition to the occurrence in c purpurea the secalonic acids a b d and ergoflavin have also been isolated from other fungi and the three secalonic acids have also been found in various lichens to date at least twenty two members of the ergochrome family have been isolated and structurally identified including secalonic acid e the enantiomer of secalonic acid a from the fungus phoma terrestris secalonic acid f from the fungus aspergillus aculeatus and secalonic acid g from the fungus pyrenochaeta terrestris in addition the monomeric units of the dimeric secalonic acids namely hemisecalonic acids b and e blennolides a

other advanced features included control surface trim tabs an autopilot and de icing boots for the wings and tailplane ordered off the drawing board the 247 first flew on february 8 1933 and entered service later that year subsequent development in airliner design saw engines and airframes becoming larger and four engined designs emerged but no significant changes to this basic formula appeared until cabin pressurization and high altitude cruise were introduced in 1940 with the boeing 307 stratoliner boeing had eclipsed other aviation manufacturers by introducing a host of aerodynamic and technical features into a commercial airliner this advanced design which was a progression from earlier monomail models 200 221 221a and b 9 bomber designs combined speed and safety the boeing 247 was faster than the u s premier fighter aircraft of its day the boeing p 12 which was an open cockpit biplane yet its flight envelope included a rather docile landing speed which precluded the need for flaps and pilots learned that at speeds as low as the 247 could be taxied tail high for ease of ground handling the 247 was the first twin engined passenger transport able to fly on one engine with controllable

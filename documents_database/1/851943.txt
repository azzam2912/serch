it has created a range of re programmable silicon based on xilinx virtex 4 fpga field programmable gate array and asics that offload and accelerate really complex algorithms such as xml parsing scanning for computer viruses email spam and intruders in intrusion prevention systems and unified threat management appliances as well as inspecting content its content processors can also transform content and they are used for xml transformation xslt compression encryption as well as hd video encoding for wmv and vc 1 formats in june 2006 tarari announced that its next generation chips that will support the amd torrenza initiative and it will incorporate hypertransport interfaces hypertransport based systems offer a dramatically reduced latency and increased throughput this is because a hypertransport connected system allows a co processor to have direct access to the system s hypertransport bus and thus as much access to system resources as other conventional cpus pci express and hypertransport buses both allow systems to communicate at 20 25 gbit s versus 4 8 gbit s for peripheral component interconnect pci pci x based systems just as the latest desktop machines are using pci express for their high performance graphic cards now servers will be able

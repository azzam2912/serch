a spiral configuration of the shell is found in of numerous gastropods but it is also found in shelled cephalopods including nautilus spirula and the large extinct subclass of cephalopods known as the ammonites a spiral shell can be visualized as consisting of a long conical tube the growth of which is coiled into an overall helical or planispiral shape for reasons of both strength and compactness the number of whorls which exist in an adult shell of a particular species depends on mathematical factors in the geometric growth as described in d arcy wentworth thompson s classic 1917 book on growth and form and by david raup the main factor is how rapidly the conical tube expands or flares out over time when the rate of expansion is low such that each subsequent whorl is not that much wider than the previous one then the adult shell has numerous whorls when the mathematical factors governing the pattern of growth are such that there is a very rapid expansion of the conical shape of the shell tube then the adult shell has very few whorls the number of whorls present in an adult shell differs greatly in various taxa the

the 98 kd nucleoporin is generated through a biogenesis pathway that involves synthesis and proteolytic cleavage of a 186 kd precursor protein this cleavage results in the 98 kd nucleoporin as well as a 96 kd nucleoporin both of which are localized to the nucleoplasmic side of the npc rat studies show that the 98 kd nucleoporin functions as one of several docking site nucleoporins of transport substrates the human gene has been shown to fuse to several genes following chromosome translocations in acute myelogenous leukemia aml and t cell acute lymphocytic leukemia t all this gene is one of several genes located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15 5 an important tumor suppressor gene region alterations in this region have been associated with the beckwith wiedemann syndrome wilms tumor rhabdomyosarcoma adrenocortical carcinoma and lung ovarian and breast cancer alternative splicing of this gene results in several transcript variants however not all variants have been fully described nup98 has been shown to interact with

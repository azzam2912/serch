it is primarily used to produce the ruby and sapphire varieties of corundum as well as the diamond simulants rutile and strontium titanate the principle of the process involves melting a finely powdered substance using an oxyhydrogen flame and crystallising the melted droplets into a boule the process is considered to be the founding step of modern industrial crystal growth technology and remains in wide use to this day since the study of alchemy began there have been attempts to synthetically produce precious stones and ruby being one of the prized cardinal gems has long been a prime candidate in the 19th century significant advances were achieved with the first ruby formed by melting two smaller rubies together in 1817 and the first microscopic crystals created from alumina aluminium oxide in a laboratory in 1837 by 1877 chemist edmond fr my had devised an effective method for commercial ruby manufacture by using molten baths of alumina yielding the first gemstone quality synthetic stones the parisian chemist auguste verneuil collaborated with fr my on developing the method but soon went on to independently develop the flame fusion process which would eventually come to bear his name one of verneuil s sources

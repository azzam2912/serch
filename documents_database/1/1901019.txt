the mine is located in the centre of the country in ontario the mine has estimated reserves of of gold musselwhite mine uses a gold cyanidation and cip carbon in pulp extraction process ore is extracted via a blast hole process and moved via a series of scoop trams and underground dump trucks to one of 2 rockbreakers either on the surface or at a 400 meter level the ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and through a series of conveyor belts and countinously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit when the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 m the slurry is then thickened exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution absorbed from the solution with activated carbon rinsed off the carbon passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars the leftover tailings are passed through an inco so cyanide destruction process the remaining tailings are sent though a final

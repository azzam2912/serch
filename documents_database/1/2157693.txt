the recname a8mya2 also refers to the protein coded by cxorf49 or cxorf49b cxorf49 is located on the x chromosome at xq13 1 it is 3912 base pairs long and the gene sequence has 6 exons cxorf49 has one protein coding transcript the protein has 514 amino acids and a molecular mass of 54 4 kda the isoelectric point is 9 3 compared to other human proteins cxorf49 is glycine and proline rich but the protein has lower levels of asparagine isoleucine tyrosine and threonine statistical analysis of protein sequences saps the domain of unknown function duf4641 is almost the entire protein it is 433 amino acids long from amino acid 80 until amino acid number 512 duf4641 is a part of pfam15483 the domain is proline and arginine rich but duf4641 has lower levels of isoleucine tyrosine and threonine compared to other proteins in human analysis of protein sequences saps duf4641 has an unusual spacing between lysine residues and positive charged amino acids analysis of protein sequences saps cxorf49 is predicted to have several post translational sites this include sites for n acetyltransferase netacet 1 glycation of amino groups of lysines netglycate 1 0 mucin type galnac o glycosylation

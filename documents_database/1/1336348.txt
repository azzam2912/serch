pr sm is integrated with all ibm system z machines similar facilities exist on the i and p versions of ibm power systems ibm introduced pr sm in 1988 with the ibm 3090 processors ibm developed the concept of hypervisors in their cp 40 and cp 67 and in 1972 provided it for the s 370 as virtual machine facility 370 ibm introduced the start interpretive execution sie instruction as part of 370 xa on the 3081 and vm xa versions of vm to exploit it pr sm is a type 1 hypervisor based on the cp component of vm xa that runs directly on the machine level and allocates system resources across lpars to share physical resources it is a standard feature on ibm z and ibm linuxone machines ibm introduced a related simplified optional feature called dynamic partition manager dpm on its ibm z13 and first generation ibm linuxone machines dpm provides web based user interfaces for many lpar related configuration and monitoring tasks

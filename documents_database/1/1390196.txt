such systems are offered as optional equipment on certain premium vehicles the technology was first introduced in the year 2000 on the cadillac deville this technology is based on the night vision devices nvd which generally denotes any electronically enhanced optical devices operate in three modes image enhancement thermal imaging and active illumination the automotive night vision system is a combination of nvds such as infrared cameras gps lidar and radar among others to sense and detect objects there are two types of systems either passive or active systems both have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other the passive system pertains to the technologies that detect thermal radiation emitted by humans animals and other objects in the road while the active systems illuminate objects as a significant distance ahead using infrared light sources active systems use an infrared light source built into the car to illuminate the road ahead with light that is invisible to humans there are two kinds of active systems gated and non gated the gated system uses a pulsed light source and a synchronized camera that enable long ranges 250m and high performance in rain and snow near infrared wavelength is 0 75 1

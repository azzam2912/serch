it has the appearance of reddish brown crystals with melting point 199 c and maximum absorption at 520 357 nm sudan iv is one of the dyes used for sudan staining similar dyes include oil red o sudan iii and sudan black b staining is an important biochemical technique offering the ability to visually qualify the presence of the fatty compound of interest without isolating it for staining purposes sudan iv can be made up in propylene glycol alternatively authors have reported using the dye saturated in isopropyl alcohol 95 ethanol or 0 05 by weight in acetone ethanol water 50 35 15 the idea is to use a moderately apolar solvent to solubilize the dye allowing it to partition into the highly apolar fat without the solvent solubilizing the fat to be stained sudan i sudan iii and sudan iv have been classified as category 3 carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer in its purified form it is called biebrich scarlet r which should not be confused with the water soluble biebrich scarlet in industry it is used to color nonpolar substances like oils fats waxes greases various hydrocarbon products and acrylic emulsions sudan iv is

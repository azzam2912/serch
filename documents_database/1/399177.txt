in liquids it usually decreases with temperature whereas in gases it increases this article discusses several models of this dependence ranging from rigorous first principles calculations for monatomic gases to empirical correlations for liquids understanding the temperature dependence of viscosity is important in many applications for instance engineering lubricants that perform well under varying temperature conditions such as in a car engine since the performance of a lubricant depends in part on its viscosity engineering problems of this type fall under the purview of tribology here dynamic viscosity is denoted by formula 1 and kinematic viscosity by formula 2 the formulas given are valid only for an absolute temperature scale therefore unless stated otherwise temperatures are in kelvins viscosity in gases arises from molecules traversing layers of flow and transferring momentum between layers this transfer of momentum can be thought of as a frictional force between layers of flow since the momentum transfer is caused by free motion of gas molecules between collisions increasing thermal agitation of the molecules results in a larger viscosity hence gaseous viscosity increases with temperature in liquids viscous forces are caused by molecules exerting attractive forces on each other across layers of flow increasing temperature

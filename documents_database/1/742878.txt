members of camarophyllopsis are distinguished from members of the family hygrophoraceae mainly by their hymenoderm pileipellis the arrangement of lamellar trama is highly variable between species coloration of the fruit body is dull tending toward browns and grays many members of this genus were formerly classified in the genus hygrotrama but the two genera were subsequently put in synonymy camarophyllopsis was circumscribed by czech mycologist josef herink in 1958 with hygrophorus schulzeri as the type and only species roger heim had the year previously treated this group of species under the name hodophilus but this was invalid because he did not include a latin diagnosis for the genus as was required by the rules of botanical nomenclature at the time rolf singer published hygrotrama in march 1959 with type species hygrotrama dennisianum and heim later 1966 published the name hodophilus validly type species h foetens since camarophyllopsis was published earlier than either of these competing names it has priority eef arnolds proposed an infrageneric classification of camarophyllopsis consisting of two subgenera differentiated by the structure of the cap cuticle pileipellis subgenus camarophyllis contained species with a trichodermium pileipellis with hyphae arranged perpendicularly to the cap surface while species in subgenus

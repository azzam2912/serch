the turbine design begun in 1938 was a high performance machine which showed jakob s influence but was rather simpler to construct it was a mid wing cantilever monoplane with gull wings of strongly straight tapered elliptically tipped plan the inner panels extended over rather more than one third span and were mounted with about 10 of dihedral there was no dihedral outboard but the trailing edges of these outer panels was completely occupied with ailerons there were spoilers on the inner panels at about mid chord its fuselage was ovoid in cross section and plywood skinned tapering markedly towards the tail the long multi framed canopy glazing extended forward to form the nose profile and provide a clear view forward the horizontal tail like the wing was straight tapered and round tipped the cantilever tailplane was mounted over the fuselage on a short pedestal its elevators having a cut out between them for rudder movement there was no fin but the aerodynamically balanced rudder was broad and roughly d shaped extending down to the keel where its underside was protected by a long tail bumper the turbine landed not on a skid but a small semi recessed monowheel located

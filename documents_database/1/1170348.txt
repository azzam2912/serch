functional il 17r is a heteromeric complex consisting of at least il17ra and il17rc a number of additional variants exist including il17rb which binds preferentially il17b and il17e a total of five members of the family have been identified the first identified member il 17ra is located on human chromosome 22 there are two il17rs il17ra and il17rd in the genome of the basal chordate amphioxus after two rounds of whole genome duplications these two il17r genes expanded into five early vertebrate il17r genes il17ra to il17re two il17ra and il17rd are found in most vertebrates whereas the other three il17rb ilr17rc and il17re have undergone some losses in vertebrates during evolution il 17ra is the founding member of a new il 17r a e subfamily of cytokine receptors il 17ra is by far the largest member of the family and has the largest cytoplasmic tail of the family this cytoplasmic tail provides docking sites for numerous signaling intermediates il 17ra is composed of both alpha helices and beta sheets and has fibronectin domains beta sandwich domains and ectodomains il 17 ra has been observed at high levels in certain tissues such as haematopoietic bone marrow thymus and spleen tissue

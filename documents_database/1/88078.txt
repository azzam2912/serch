based on available observational evidence deciding the fate and evolution of the universe have now become valid cosmological questions being beyond the mostly untestable constraints of mythological or theological beliefs many possible futures have been predicted by different scientific hypotheses including that the universe might have existed for a finite and infinite duration or towards explaining the manner and circumstances of its beginning observations made by edwin hubble during the 1920s 1950s found that galaxies appeared to be moving away from each other leading to the currently accepted big bang theory this suggests that the universe began very small and very dense about 13 8 billion years ago and it has expanded and on average become less dense ever since confirmation of the big bang mostly depends on knowing the rate of expansion average density of matter and the physical properties of the mass energy in the universe there is a strong consensus among cosmologists that the universe is considered flat see shape of the universe and will continue to expand forever factors that need to be considered in determining the universe s origin and ultimate fate include the average motions of galaxies the shape and structure of the universe

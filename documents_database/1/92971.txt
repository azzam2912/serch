they are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement some joints such as the knee elbow and shoulder are self lubricating almost frictionless and are able to withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement only during birth in order to protect the brain and the sense organs the connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint and is described as a fibrous joint known as a gomphosis joints are classified both structurally and functionally joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones in practice there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications structural classification names and divides joints according to the type of binding tissue that connects the bones to each other there are four structural classifications of joints joints can also be classified functionally according to the type and degree of movement they allow joint movements are described with reference to the basic anatomical

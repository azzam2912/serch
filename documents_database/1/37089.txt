the set of all algebraic integers is closed under addition subtraction and multiplication and therefore is a commutative subring of the complex numbers the ring is the integral closure of regular integers in complex numbers the ring of integers of a number field denoted by is the intersection of and it can also be characterised as the maximal order of the field each algebraic integer belongs to the ring of integers of some number field a number is an algebraic integer if and only if the ring is finitely generated as an abelian group which is to say as a module the following are equivalent definitions of an algebraic integer let be a number field i e a finite extension of the set of rational numbers in other words for some algebraic number by the primitive element theorem algebraic integers are a special case of integral elements of a ring extension in particular an algebraic integer is an integral element of a finite extension

one was built 6200 delivered in september 1944 the s2 was the sole example of the 6 8 6 wheel arrangement in the whyte notation with a six wheel leading truck eight driving wheels and a six wheel trailing truck the s2 used a direct drive steam turbine provided by the westinghouse electric manufacturing company geared to the center pair of axles with the outer two axles connected by side rods the fixed gear ratio was 18 5 1 such design was to prevent energy loss and s2 achieved a mechanical efficiency of 97 which means only 3 of steam energy was lost within the propulsion equipment the disadvantage of direct drive steam turbine was that the turbine could not operate at optimal speeds over the locomotive s entire speed range the s2 was the largest heaviest and fastest direct drive turbine locomotive design ever built the locomotive was to be a 4 8 4 but wartime restrictions on light steel alloys increased weight until six wheel leading and trailing trucks were needed its construction was also delayed by world war ii construction of the locomotive took place at the baldwin plant in eddystone two turbines were fitted one for

although they are often found in insects peritrophic matrixes are found in seven different phyla the peritrophic matrix serves several functions including improvement of digestion protection against mechanical and chemical damage and serving as a barrier to infection by pathogens the peritrophic matrix is composed of regularly arranged chitin microfibrils 3 13 of matrix mass and species specific proteins 20 55 embedded in a proteoglycan matrix the peritrophic matrix also includes very small pores which allow for passage of small molecules into and out of the matrix thus due to size limitations pores reach a maximum size of 10 nm larger unwanted materials taken in while feeding are trapped and excreted along with the matrix type i formation of a peritrophic matrix is thought to be the ancestral method and is found in the majority of organisms that produce a peritrophic matrix in type i formation the peritrophic matrix is secreted by the entire midgut and is formed simply by delamination from the surface of the midgut epithelium type i formation usually occurs as a response to feeding but can also be produced continually when formed in response to feeding a single matrix is secreted by the midgut epithelium this

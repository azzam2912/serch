the concept was introduced by deligne let x be a complex manifold d x a divisor and a holomorphic p form on x d if and d have a pole of order at most one along d then is said to have a logarithmic pole along d is also known as a logarithmic p form the logarithmic p forms make up a subsheaf of the meromorphic p forms on x with a pole along d denoted in the theory of riemann surfaces one encounters logarithmic one forms which have the local expression for some meromorphic function resp rational function formula 3 where g is holomorphic and non vanishing at 0 and m is the order of f at 0 that is for some open covering there are local representations of this differential form as a logarithmic derivative modified slightly with the exterior derivative d in place of the usual differential operator d dz observe that has only simple poles with integer residues on higher dimensional complex manifolds the poincar residue is used to describe the distinctive behavior of logarithmic forms along poles by definition of formula 4 and the fact that exterior differentiation d satisfies d 0 one has this

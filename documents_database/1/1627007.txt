and formerly jointly with roy spencer satellites do not measure temperature directly they measure radiances in various wavelength bands from which temperature may be inferred the resulting temperature profiles depend on details of the methods that are used to obtain temperatures from radiances as a result different groups that have analyzed the satellite data have obtained different temperature data among these groups are remote sensing systems rss and the university of alabama in huntsville uah the satellite series is not fully homogeneous it is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical instrumentation the sensors deteriorate over time and corrections are necessary for satellite drift and orbital decay particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites making intercalibration difficult uah provide data on three broad levels of the atmosphere data are provided as temperature anomalies against the seasonal average over a past basis period as well as in absolute temperature values all the data products can be downloaded from the uah server data are available as global hemispheric zonal and gridded averages the global average covers 97 98 of the earth s surface excluding

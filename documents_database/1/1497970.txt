consequently every decision tree algorithm that represents the function has at worst case a running time of n the following is a boolean function on the three variables x y z where formula 1 is the bitwise and formula 2 is the bitwise or and formula 3 is the bitwise not this function is not evasive because there is a decision tree that solves it by checking exactly two variables the algorithm first checks the value of x if x is true the algorithm checks the value of y and returns it if x is false the algorithm checks the value of z and returns it consider this simple and function on three variables a worst case input for every algorithm is 1 1 1 in every order we choose to check the variables we have to check all of them note that in general there could be a different worst case input for every decision tree algorithm hence the functions and or on n variables are evasive for the case of binary zero sum games every evaluation function is evasive in every zero sum game the value of the game is achieved by the minimax algorithm player 1 tries

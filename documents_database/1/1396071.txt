although originally described by philippi in 1858 it has long remained buried in other taxa principally hippeastrum and more recently rhodophiala only in recent years has it been rehabilitated restoring the genus was first proposed by naranjo poggio 2000 and accepted by ravenna in 2003 although he used the name rhodolirion originally used by baker 1878 in his very broad construction of hippeastrum including both rhodophiala and rhodolirion he also renamed rhodolirium andinum as hippeastrum rhodolirion later he elevated rhodolirion to the status of subgenus with h rhodolirion subsequently rhodophiala rhodolirion as the type species subsequently the genus has been treated as part of rhodophiala flowers single or pluriflor perigone infundibular funnel shaped with elongated floral tube paraperigonium if present has free segments stigma capitate for early treatment of rhodolirium see taxonomy of hippeastrum the rehabilitation has yet as of february 2016 to be recognised by the world checklist of selected plant families but is by the missouri botanical gardens with six species the ability to resolve phylogenetic relationships based solely on morphological data is limited in the amaryllidaceae necessitating the use of molecular methods in addition in their study of the american amaryllidaceae meerow et al 2000 noted that

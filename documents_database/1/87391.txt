the class of normal operators is well understood examples of normal operators are a normal matrix is the matrix expression of a normal operator on the hilbert space c normal operators are characterized by the spectral theorem a compact normal operator in particular a normal operator on a finite dimensional linear space is unitarily diagonalizable let t be a bounded operator the following are equivalent if n is a normal operator then n and n have the same kernel and the same range consequently the range of n is dense if and only if n is injective put in another way the kernel of a normal operator is the orthogonal complement of its range it follows that the kernel of the operator n coincides with that of n for any k every generalized eigenvalue of a normal operator is thus genuine is an eigenvalue of a normal operator n if and only if its complex conjugate formula 6 is an eigenvalue of n eigenvectors of a normal operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal and a normal operator stabilizes the orthogonal complement of each of its eigenspaces this implies the usual spectral theorem every normal operator on a finite dimensional

spontaneous corona discharges occur naturally in high voltage systems unless care is taken to limit the electric field strength a corona will occur when the strength of the electric field potential gradient around a conductor is high enough to form a conductive region but not high enough to cause electrical breakdown or arcing to nearby objects it is often seen as a bluish or another color glow in the air adjacent to pointed metal conductors carrying high voltages and emits light by the same property as a gas discharge lamp in many high voltage applications corona is an unwanted side effect corona discharge from high voltage electric power transmission lines constitutes an economically significant waste of energy for utilities in high voltage equipment like cathode ray tube televisions radio transmitters x ray machines and particle accelerators the current leakage caused by coronas can constitute an unwanted load on the circuit in the air coronas generate gases such as ozone o and nitric oxide no and in turn nitrogen dioxide no and thus nitric acid hno if water vapor is present these gases are corrosive and can degrade and embrittle nearby materials and are also toxic to humans and the environment

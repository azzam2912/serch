this large family of compounds can be divided into ionic and covalent peroxide the first class mostly contains the peroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth metals whereas the covalent peroxides are represented by such compounds as hydrogen peroxide and peroxymonosulfuric acid hso in contrast to the purely ionic character of alkali metal peroxides peroxides of transition metals have a more covalent character the peroxide ion is composed of two oxygen atoms that are linked by a single bond the molecular orbital diagram of the peroxide dianion predicts a doubly occupied antibonding orbital and a bond order of one the bond length is 149 pm which is larger than in the ground state triplet oxygen of the oxygen molecule o 121 pm this translates into the smaller force constant of the bond 2 8 n cm vs 11 4 n cm for o and the lower frequency of the molecular vibration 770 cm vs 1555 cm for o the peroxide ion can be compared with superoxide which is a radical and dioxygen a diradical most alkali metal peroxides can be synthesized directly by oxygenation of the elements lithium peroxide is formed upon treating lithium hydroxide with hydrogen peroxide barium peroxide

it is the problem of optimizing minimizing or maximizing a function of two vector variables subject to certain requirements constraints which include that the inner product of the two vectors must equal zero i e they are orthogonal in particular for finite dimensional real vector spaces this means that if one has vectors x and y with all nonnegative components x 0 and y 0 for all formula 1 in the first quadrant if 2 dimensional in the first octant if 3 dimensional then for each pair of components x and y one of the pair must be zero hence the name complementarity e g x 1 0 and y 0 2 are complementary but x 1 1 and y 2 0 are not a complementarity problem is a special case of a variational inequality complementarity problems were originally studied because the karush kuhn tucker conditions in linear programming and quadratic programming constitute a linear complementarity problem lcp or a mixed complementarity problem mcp in 1963 lemke and howson showed that for two person games computing a nash equilibrium point is equivalent to an lcp in 1968 cottle and dantzig unified linear and quadratic programming and bimatrix games since then

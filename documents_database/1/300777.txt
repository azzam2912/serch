together with the rest of the steering mechanism it forms part of the helm it is connected to a mechanical electric servo or hydraulic system which alters the vertical angle of the vessel s rudder relative to its hull in some modern ships the wheel is replaced with a simple toggle that remotely controls an electro mechanical or electro hydraulic drive for the rudder with a rudder position indicator presenting feedback to the helmsman prior to the invention of the ship s wheel the helmsman relied on a tiller a horizontal bar fitted directly to the top of the rudder post or a whipstaff a vertical stick acting on the arm of the ship s tiller near the start of the 18th century a large number of vessels appeared using the ship s wheel design but historians are unclear when the approach was first used some modern ships have replaced the wheel with a simple toggle that remotely controls an electro mechanical or electro hydraulic drive for the rudder with a rudder position indicator presenting feedback to the helmsman a typical ship s wheel is composed of eight cylindrical wooden spokes though sometimes as few as six or as many

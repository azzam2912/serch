recently a special type of uncornered polygonal rifling with rounded valleys dubbed multi radial rifling has also been introduced by the italian firearm manufacturer sabatti s p a polygons with a larger number of edges provide a better gas seal in relatively large diameter polygonally rifled bores in the pre gen 5 glock pistol for instance octagonal rifling is used in the large diameter 45 acp bore which has an 11 23 mm 0 442 in diameter since it resembles a circle more closely than the hexagonal rifling used in smaller diameter bores while polygonal rifling has been around since the earliest days of rifled barrels it had faded out of use by the time of the early cordite cartridges the principle of the polygonal barrel was proposed in 1853 by sir joseph whitworth a prominent british engineer and entrepreneur whitworth experimented with cannons using twisted hexagonal barrels instead of traditional round rifled barrels which was patented in 1854 in 1856 this concept was demonstrated in a series of experiments using brass howitzers the british military however rejected whitworth s polygonal rifled designs whitworth believed that polygonal rifling could be used to create a more accurate rifled musket to replace

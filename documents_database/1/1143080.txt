thus signal flow graph theory builds on that of directed graphs also called digraphs which includes as well that of oriented graphs this mathematical theory of digraphs exists of course quite apart from its applications sfgs are most commonly used to represent signal flow in a physical system and its controller s forming a cyber physical system among their other uses are the representation of signal flow in various electronic networks and amplifiers digital filters state variable filters and some other types of analog filters in nearly all literature a signal flow graph is associated with a set of linear equations wai kai chen wrote the concept of a signal flow graph was originally worked out by shannon 1942 in dealing with analog computers the greatest credit for the formulation of signal flow graphs is normally extended to mason 1953 1956 he showed how to use the signal flow graph technique to solve some difficult electronic problems in a relatively simple manner the term signal flow graph was used because of its original application to electronic problems and the association with electronic signals and flowcharts of the systems under study lorens wrote previous to mason s work c e shannon

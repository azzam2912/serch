the culmination of twelve years of research robobee solved two key technical challenges of micro robotics engineers invented a process inspired by pop up books that allowed them to build on a sub millimeter scale precisely and efficiently to achieve flight they created artificial muscles capable of beating the wings 120 times per second the goal of the robobee project is to make a fully autonomous swarm of flying robots for applications such as search and rescue surveillance and artificial pollination to make this feasible researchers need to figure out how to get power supply and decision making functions which are currently supplied to the robot via a tiny tether which is integrated with the main body the wingspan of robobee makes it the smallest man made device modeled on an insect to achieve flight for more than a decade researchers at harvard university have been working on developing tiny flying robots the united states defense advanced research projects agency funded early research in the hopes that it would lead to stealth surveillance solutions for the battlefield and urban situations inspired by the biology of a fly early efforts focused on getting the robot airborne flight was achieved in 2007

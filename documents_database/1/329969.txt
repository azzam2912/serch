they are thus significantly smaller than those used in ten pin bowling but are slightly larger and heavier than those used in candlepin bowling duckpins though arranged in a triangle identical to that used in ten pin bowling are shorter slightly thinner and lighter than their ten pin equivalents which makes it more difficult for the smaller ball to achieve a strike for this reason similar to candlepin bowling the bowler is allowed three rolls per frame duckpin bowling has rules similar to ten pin bowling in a 10 frame game bowlers try to knock down pins in the fewest rolls per frame bowlers have three balls per frame instead of two as in ten pin bowling to knock over a set of 10 pins if a bowler knocks down all 10 pins with their first roll in a frame it is scored as a strike if all the pins are knocked down in two rolls the bowler has made a spare if all the pins are knocked down in three rolls it is scored as a ten as in candlepins with no bonus if pins are still standing after the third ball the bowler gets one point for each

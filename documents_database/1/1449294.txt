this man was killed on the job due to the negligence of mr denham s co workers the dead man was at all times paid by the company and the company alone had the power to dismiss him the question was whether mr denham s insurer or the insurer of the company should pay the damages to the deceased man s widow denning lj held that a contract of service cannot be transferred from one employer to another without the servant s consent and it must be real consent at 444 these results are achieved in law by holding that clegg became for the time being the temporary servant for le grands there is no harm in thus describing him so long as it is remembered that it is a device designed to cast liability on the temporary employer the real basis of the liability is however simply this if a temporary employer has the right to control the manner in which a labourer does his work so as to be able to tell him the right way or the wrong way to do it then he should be responsible when he does it in the wrong way as well

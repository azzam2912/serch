the zygentoma include the so called silverfish or fishmoths and the firebrats a conspicuous feature of the order is that the members all have three long caudal filaments the two lateral filaments are cerci and the medial one is an epiproct or appendix dorsalis in this they resemble the archaeognatha though unlike in the latter order the cerci of zygentoma are nearly as long as the epiproct until the late twentieth century the zygentoma were regarded as a suborder of the thysanura until it was recognized that the order thysanura was paraphyletic thus the two suborders were each raised to the status of an independent monophyletic order with archaeognatha sister taxon to the dicondylia including the zygentoma the name zygentoma is derived from the greek in context meaning yoke or bridge and insects literally cut into because of the anatomy of typical insects the idea behind the name was that the taxon formed a notional link between the pterygota and the apterygota this view is now totally obsolete but the phylogeny of the insecta was in its infancy in the late 19th and early 20th century and the name was firmly established by the time that more sophisticated views were

it was proven by leslie valiant and vijay vazirani in their paper titled np is as easy as detecting unique solutions published in 1986 the proof is based on the mulmuley vazirani vazirani isolation lemma which was subsequently used for a number of important applications in theoretical computer science the valiant vazirani theorem implies that the boolean satisfiability problem which is np complete remains a computationally hard problem even if the input instances are promised to have at most one satisfying assignment unambiguous sat is the promise problem of deciding whether a given boolean formula that has at most one satisfying assignment is unsatisfiable or has exactly one satisfying assignment in the first case an algorithm for unambiguous sat should reject and in the second it should accept the formula if the formula has more than one satisfying assignment then there is no condition on the behavior of the algorithm the promise problem unambiguous sat can be decided by a nondeterministic turing machine that has at most one accepting computation path in this sense this promise problem belongs to the complexity class up which is usually only defined for languages the proof of the valiant vazirani theorem consists of a

mwr is a multi wavelength microwave radiometer for making observations of jupiter s deep atmosphere mwr can observe radiation from 1 37 to 50 cm in wavelength from 600 mhz to 22 ghz in frequencies this supports its goal of observing the previously unseen atmospheric features and chemical abundances hundreds of miles km into jupiter s atmosphere mwr is designed to detect six different frequencies in that range using separate antennas mwr views jupiter s microwave radiation so it can see up to hundreds of miles deep into the planet in august 2016 as juno swung closely by the planet mwr achieved a penetration of 200 to 250 miles 350 to 400 kilometers below the surface cloud layer mwr is designed to make observations below the cloud tops especially detecting the abundances of certain chemicals and determine dynamic features the region has not been observed like this previously mwr was launched aboard the juno spacecraft on august 5 2011 utc from cape canaveral usa as part of the new frontiers program and after an interplanetary journey that including a swingby of earth entered a polar orbit of jupiter on july 5 2016 utc the electronics for mwr are located inside

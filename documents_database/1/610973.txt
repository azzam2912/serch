tangles are formed by hyperphosphorylation of a microtubule associated protein known as tau causing the protein to dissociate from microtubules and form aggregates in an insoluble form these aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are also referred to as paired helical filaments the precise mechanism of tangle formation is not completely understood and it is still controversial as to whether tangles are a primary causative factor in the disease or play a more peripheral role neurofibrillary tangles were first described by alois alzheimer in one of his patients suffering from alzheimer s disease ad which is considered a secondary tauopathy ad is also classified as an amyloidosis because of the presence of senile plaques when tau becomes hyperphosphorylated the protein dissociates from the microtubules in axons then tau becomes misfolded and the protein begins to aggregate which eventually forms the neurofibrillary tangles seen in alzheimer s patients microtubules also destabilize when tau is dissociated the combination of the neurofibrillary tangles and destabilized microtubules result in disruption of processes such as axonal transport and neural communication the degree of nft involvement in ad is defined by braak stages braak stages i and ii are used when nft involvement is confined mainly to

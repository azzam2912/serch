this type of modifying rna is usually located in the nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell which is a major site of snrna biogenesis it is known as a small nucleolar rna snorna and also often referred to as a guide rna u15 belongs to the c d box class of snornas which contain the conserved sequence motifs known as the c box ugauga and the d box cuga most of the members of the box c d family function in directing site specific 2 o methylation of substrate rnas u15 is predicted to guide the 2 o ribose methylation of 28s ribosomal rna rrna residue a3764 in humans there are two closely related copies of the u15 snorna called snord15a and snord15b they are both encoded in the introns of the ribosomal protein s3 in xenopus laevis it is located within the introns of ribosomal protein s1 snor75 from arabidopsis thaliana and homologues in rice oryza sativa and other plants are alternatively known as u15 and despite a significantly shorter sequence length appear to be related

a furthering of the theory of quadratic forms he stated the problem as follows as stated by kaplansky the 11th problem is simply this classify quadratic forms over algebraic number fields this is exactly what minkowski did for quadratic form with fractional coefficients a quadratic form not quadratic equation is any polynomial in which each term has variables appearing exactly twice the general form of such an equation is ax 2 bxy cy 2 all coefficients must be whole numbers a given quadratic form is said to represent a natural number if substituting specific numbers for the variables gives the number gauss and those who followed found that if we change variables in certain ways the new quadratic form represented the same natural numbers as the old but in a different more easily interpreted form he used this theory of equivalent quadratic forms to prove whole number theory results lagrange for example had shown that any natural number can be expressed as the sum of four squares gauss proved this using his theory of equivalence relations by showing that the quadratic formula 1 represents all natural numbers as mentioned earlier minkowski created and proved a similar theory for quadratic forms

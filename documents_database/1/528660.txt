a spectator ion can therefore be observed in the reaction of aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate and copper ii sulfate but does not affect the equilibrium the na and so ions are spectator ions since they remain unchanged on both sides of the equation they simply watch the other ions react hence the name they are present in total ionic equations to balance the charges of the ions whereas the cu and co ions combine to form a precipitate of solid cuco in reaction stoichiometry spectator ions are removed from a complete ionic equation to form a net ionic equation for the above example this yields so 2na co cu so 2na so cuco where x spectator ion spectator ion concentration only affects the debye length in contrast potential determining ions whose concentrations affect surface potential by surface chemical reactions as well the debye length a net ionic equation ignores the spectator ions that were part of the original equation therefore the total ionic reaction is different from the net reaction

it is a white crystalline solid that is insoluble in water and petroleum ether but well soluble in ethanol diethyl ether and benzene in strongly acidic solutions it produces an intensely yellow color due to the formation of a stable trityl carbocation many derivatives of triphenylmethanol are important dyes after the german chemist august kekul and his belgian student antoine paul nicolas franchimont 1844 1919 first synthesized triphenylmethane in 1872 the russian doctoral student walerius hemilian 1851 1914 first synthesized triphenylmethanol in 1874 by reacting triphenylmethyl bromide with water as well as by oxidizing triphenylmethane triphenylmethanol contains three phenyl rings and an alcohol group bound to a central tetrahedral carbon atom all three c ph bonds are typical of sp sp carbon carbon bonds with lengths of approximately 1 47 while the c o bond length is approximately 1 42 the presence of three adjacent phenyl groups confers special properties manifested in the reactivity of the alcohol for example it reacts with acetyl chloride not to give the ester but triphenylmethyl chloride the three phenyl groups also offer steric protection reaction with hydrogen peroxide gives an unusually stable hydroperoxide phcooh as a derivative of methanol triphenylmethanol is expected to have

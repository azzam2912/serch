the fourth axiom implies associativity there are other possible axiom systems for example the two also suffice in a boolean algebra or more generally a distributive lattice the median function formula 8 satisfies these axioms so that every boolean algebra and every distributive lattice forms a median algebra birkhoff and kiss showed that a median algebra with elements formula 9 and formula 10 satisfying formula 11 is a distributive lattice a median graph is an undirected graph in which for every three vertices formula 12 formula 13 and formula 14 there is a unique vertex formula 1 that belongs to shortest paths between any two of formula 12 formula 13 and formula 14 if this is the case then the operation formula 1 defines a median algebra having the vertices of the graph as its elements conversely in any median algebra one may define an interval formula 20 to be the set of elements formula 13 such that formula 22 one may define a graph from a median algebra by creating a vertex for each algebra element and an edge for each pair formula 23 such that the interval formula 20 contains no other elements if the algebra has the

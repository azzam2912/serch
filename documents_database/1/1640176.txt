enamel is composed mostly of mineral that is formed and regulated by the proteins in it amelogenesis imperfecta is due to the malfunction of the proteins in the enamel ameloblastin enamelin tuftelin and amelogenin as a result of abnormal enamel formation via amelogenesis people afflicted with amelogenesis imperfecta may have teeth with abnormal color yellow brown or grey this disorder can afflict any number of teeth of both dentitions enamel hypoplasia manifests in a variety of ways depending on the type of ai an individual has see below with pitting and plane form defects common the teeth have a higher risk for dental cavities and are hypersensitive to temperature changes as well as rapid attrition excessive calculus deposition and gingival hyperplasia the earliest known case of ai is in an extinct hominid species called paranthropus robustus with over a third of individuals displaying this condition several gene expression is needed for enamel formation where the relevant matrix proteins proteinases are transcribed for regular crystal growth enamel mineralization mutations in the amelx enam mmp20 klk 4 fam83h wdr72 c4orf26 slc24a4 lamb3 and itgb6 genes have been found to cause amelogenesis imperfecta non syndromic form amelx and enam encode extracellular matrix proteins

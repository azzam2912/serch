the class of fourier integral operators contains differential operators as well as classical integral operators as special cases a fourier integral operator formula 1 is given by where formula 3 denotes the fourier transform of formula 4 formula 5 is a standard symbol which is compactly supported in formula 6 and formula 7 is real valued and homogeneous of degree formula 8 in formula 9 it is also necessary to require that formula 10 on the support of a under these conditions if a is of order zero it is possible to show that formula 1 defines a bounded operator from formula 12 to formula 12 one motivation for the study of fourier integral operators is the solution operator for the initial value problem for the wave operator indeed consider the following problem and the solution to this problem is given by formula 16 these need to be interpreted as oscillatory integrals since they do not in general converge this formally looks like a sum of two fourier integral operators however the coefficients in each of the integrals are not smooth at the origin and so not standard symbols if we cut out this singularity with a cutoff function then

this theory is applicable to massive particles propagating at all velocities up to those comparable to the speed of light c and can accommodate massless particles the theory has application in high energy physics particle physics and accelerator physics as well as atomic physics chemistry and condensed matter physics non relativistic quantum mechanics refers to the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics applied in the context of galilean relativity more specifically quantizing the equations of classical mechanics by replacing dynamical variables by operators relativistic quantum mechanics rqm is quantum mechanics applied with special relativity although the earlier formulations like the schr dinger picture and heisenberg picture were originally formulated in a non relativistic background a few of them e g the heisenberg formulism also works with special relativity key features common to all rqms include the prediction of antimatter electron spin spin magnetic moments of elementary spin fermions fine structure and quantum dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields the key result is the dirac equation from which these predictions emerge automatically by contrast in non relativistic quantum mechanics terms have to be introduced artificially into the hamiltonian operator to achieve agreement with experimental observations the most successful and most widely

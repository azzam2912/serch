remineralisation can contribute towards restoring strength and function within tooth structure demineralization is the removal of minerals mainly calcium from any of the hard tissues enamel dentine and cementum it begins at the surface and may progress into cavitation unless arrested or reversed by remineralisation when food or drinks containing fermentable sugars enter the mouth the bacteria in dental plaque rapidly feed on the sugars and produce organic acids as by products the glucose produced from starch by salivary amylase is also digested by the bacteria when enough acid is produced so that the ph goes below 5 5 the acid dissolves carbonated hydroxyapatite the main component of tooth enamel the plaque can hold the acids in contact with the tooth for up to two hours before it is neutralised by saliva once the plaque acid has been neutralised the minerals can return from the plaque and saliva to the enamel surface however the capacity for remineralisation is limited and if sugars enter the mouth too frequently a net loss of mineral from enamel produces a cavity through which bacteria can infect the inner tooth and destroy the latticework this process requires many months or years although a key feature

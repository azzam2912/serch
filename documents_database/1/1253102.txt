the reason was because cameo parkway s collection of songs was not able to be licensed for release on cd at that time rhino therefore could not include the original recording it is a rare instance that rhino would substitute an original recording for a newer recording three versions of this volume in the billboard top hits series were released the original version was released in 1988 and included two appearances by elvis presley it s now or never and stuck on you in 1993 the album was re released and replaced the two elvis songs with joe jones you talk too much and brenda lee s sweet nothin s the album was again reissued in 1997 and the presley songs were replaced with another two songs mister custer and poetry in motion the track lineup on the original 1988 release includes eight songs that reached the top of the billboard hot 100 chart the two exceptions were handy man and walk don t run the substitution of the elvis presley tracks on the re release brings that number down to six for the 1993 reissue and seven for the 1997 reissue as mister custer was the only chart topper

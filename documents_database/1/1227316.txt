it was built in 1966 to allow the evaluation of magnetic movement in manned and unmanned spacecraft and for the precision calibration of magnetometers used in space flight the building is constructed of non magnetic materials and contains a magnetic coil system that allows the cancellation of the earth s magnetic field this unique building was designated a national historic landmark in 1985 the facility is currently managed by the goddard mechanical systems division the spacecraft magnetic test facility is located about east of the main campus of the goddard space flight center in building 310 20 on the north side of good luck road the building is a single story structure square and is built entirely out of nonmagnetic materials the building contains a diameter 3 axis braunbek coil with four loops on each axis the coil cancels the earth s magnetic field within a central spherical volume fluctuations in the ambient field are removed by a servo control producing stability to half a nanotesla an artificial magnetic vector can be produced and rotated at a variable rate helmholtz coils are used for perm deperm operations a monorail hoist is provided to move equipment in and out of the

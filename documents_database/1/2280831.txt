175 composition no 126 trillium dialogues m is a live album by composer and pianist anthony braxton with the creative jazz orchestra performing two extended compositions recorded at the london jazz festival in 1994 and released on the leo label the allmusic review by arwulf arwulf stated both works are outgrowths of the composer s trillium opera project which was first defined a full decade before this recording was made structurally and texturally the music at times seems closely aligned with what braxton refers to as the post webern continuum in the selection and configuration of tones and the use of silence as a structural element the keyboard improvisations of roy powell are especially intriguing as is the interplay among the instrumentalists behind the declamatory vocals composition 175 which occupies the first disc in the set and features two vocalists rather than four illustrates a later stage in the trillium development the opportunity to experience anthony braxton s approach to opera is most auspicious on all about jazz john eyles noted despite the orchestra s name this music is most definitely not jazz it is avant garde opera the voices dominate and the orchestra rarely does more than accompany them

on its apical surface lumen side cells of the dct have a thiazide sensitive na cl cotransporter and are permeable to ca via the trpv5 channel on the basolateral surface peritubular capillary side there is an atp dependent na k antiporter pump a secondary active na ca transporter and an atp dependent ca transporter the basolateral atp dependent na k pump produces the gradient for na to be absorbed from the apical surface via the na cl symporter and for ca to be reclaimed into the blood by the na ca basolateral antiporter thiazide diuretics inhibit na cl reabsorption from the dct by blocking the thiazide sensitive na cl cotransporter by inhibiting the transporter thiazide diuretics increase the gradient potential for na this increases the activity of the basolateral na ca antiport and causes the increase in calcium reclamation associated with thiazide diuretics the dct is lined with simple cuboidal cells that are shorter than those of the proximal convoluted tubule pct the lumen appears larger in dct than the pct lumen because the pct has a brush border microvilli dct can be recognized by its numerous mitochondria basal infoldings and lateral membrane interdigitations with neighboring cells the point where

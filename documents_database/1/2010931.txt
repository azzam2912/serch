developmental haemostasis is a term that represents the maturation of the haemostatic system from birth to adulthood there are differences in the concentration structure and activity of many proteins involved in blood clotting these changes play an important role in physiological development and are important in providing appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bleeding and clotting disorders e g thrombosis the age specific differences in the blood clotting system may contribute to the fact that children are less prone to developing thrombosis compared to adults studies have shown that there are structural differences in some of the major blood clotting proteins in newborns and children when compared to adults these structural differences can lead to differences in the activity of haemostatic proteins within the blood clotting system as well as other physiological systems e g immune system some examples of age specific differences in the structure of blood clotting proteins are reference ranges demonstrate the normal test values for a healthy population diseases and disorders are diagnosed when a test value is outside the reference range many laboratories compare paediatric results to adult reference ranges or to published paediatric reference ranges that may not be specific for the test used this

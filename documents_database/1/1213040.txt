the generation and visualization of co occurrence networks has become practical with the advent of electronically stored text compliant to text mining by way of definition co occurrence networks are the collective interconnection of terms based on their paired presence within a specified unit of text networks are generated by connecting pairs of terms using a set of criteria defining co occurrence for example terms a and b may be said to co occur if they both appear in a particular article another article may contain terms b and c linking a to b and b to c creates a co occurrence network of these three terms rules to define co occurrence within a text corpus can be set according to desired criteria for example a more stringent criteria for co occurrence may require a pair of terms to appear in the same sentence co occurrence networks can be created for any given list of terms any dictionary in relation to any collection of texts any text corpus co occurring pairs of terms can be called neighbors and these often group into neighborhoods based on their interconnections individual terms may have several neighbors neighborhoods may connect to one another through

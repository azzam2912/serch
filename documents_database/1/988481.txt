they are components of the ro60 ribonucleoprotein particle which is a target of autoimmune antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus they are also necessary for dna replication through interactions with chromatin and initiation proteins these small rnas are predicted to fold into a conserved stem formed by the rna s 3 and 5 ends and characterized by a single bulged cytosine which are the known requirements for ro binding two functions have been described for y rnas in the literature as a repressor of ro60 and as an initiation factor for dna replication mutant human y rnas lacking the conserved binding site for ro60 protein still support dna replication indicating that binding to ro protein and promoting dna replication are two separable functions of y rnas although y rna derived small rnas are similar in size to micrornas it has been shown that these y rna fragments are not involved in the microrna pathway in its free state ro binds to a variety of misfolded rnas including misfolded 5s rrnas and is thought to act as some sort of quality control mechanism crystal structures of ro complexed either with y rna or another rna showed that ro binds single

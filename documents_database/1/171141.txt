it is the source of the heat resistant enzyme taq dna polymerase one of the most important enzymes in molecular biology because of its use in the polymerase chain reaction pcr dna amplification technique when studies of biological organisms in hot springs began in the 1960s scientists thought that the life of thermophilic bacteria could not be sustained in temperatures above about soon however it was discovered that many bacteria in different springs not only survived but also thrived in higher temperatures in 1969 thomas d brock and hudson freeze of indiana university reported a new species of thermophilic bacteria which they named thermus aquaticus the bacterium was first isolated from mushroom spring in the lower geyser basin of yellowstone national park which is near the major great fountain geyser and white dome geyser and has since been found in similar thermal habitats around the world it thrives at 70 c 158 f but can survive at temperatures of 50 c to 80 c 122 f to 176 f this bacterium is a chemotroph it performs chemosynthesis to obtain food however since its range of temperature overlaps somewhat with that of the photosynthetic cyanobacteria that share its ideal environment it

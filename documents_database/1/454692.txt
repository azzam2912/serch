some smaller kitplanes have flaperons for reasons of simplicity of manufacture while some large commercial aircraft may have a flaperon between the flaps and aileron in addition to controlling the roll or bank of an aircraft as do conventional ailerons both flaperons can be lowered together to function similarly to a set of flaps on a plane with flaperons the pilot still has the standard separate controls for ailerons and flaps but the flap control also varies the flaperon s range of movement a mechanical device called a mixer is used to combine the pilot s input into the flaperons while the use of flaperons rather than ailerons and flaps might seem to be a simplification some complexity remains through the intricacies of the mixer some aircraft such as the denney kitfox suspend the flaperons below the wing rather in the manner of slotted flaps to provide undisturbed airflow at high angles of attack or low airspeeds when the flaperon surface is hinged below the trailing edge of a wing they are sometimes named junker flaperons from the doppelfl gel lit double wing type of trailing edge surfaces used on a number of junkers aircraft of the 1930s such as

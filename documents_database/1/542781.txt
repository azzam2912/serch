in the case of fields the ibn property becomes the statement that finite dimensional vector spaces have a unique dimension a ring r has invariant basis number ibn if for all positive integers m and n r isomorphic to r as left r modules implies that equivalently this means there do not exist distinct positive integers m and n such that r is isomorphic to r rephrasing the definition of invariant basis number in terms of matrices it says that whenever a is an m by n matrix over r and b is an n by m matrix over r such that and then this form reveals that the definition is left right symmetric so it makes no difference whether we define ibn in terms of left or right modules the two definitions are equivalent note that the isomorphisms in the definitions are not ring isomorphisms they are module isomorphisms the main purpose of the invariant basis number condition is that free modules over an ibn ring satisfy an analogue of the dimension theorem for vector spaces any two bases for a free module over an ibn ring have the same cardinality assuming the ultrafilter lemma a strictly weaker form

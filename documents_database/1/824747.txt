knowledge of the redox conditions or equivalently oxygen fugacities at which a rock forms and evolves can be important for interpreting the rock history iron sulfur and manganese are three of the relatively abundant elements in the earth s crust that occur in more than one oxidation state for instance iron the fourth most abundant element in the crust exists as native iron ferrous iron fe and ferric iron fe the redox state of a rock affects the relative proportions of the oxidation states of these elements and hence may determine both the minerals present and their compositions if a rock contains pure minerals that constitute a redox buffer then the oxygen fugacity of equilibration is defined by one of the curves in the accompanying fugacity temperature diagram for other rocks with suitable minerals oxygen fugacities can be calculated and the redox conditions can be obtained by comparison to the fugacity temperature diagram common redox buffers redox buffers were developed in part to control oxygen fugacities in laboratory experiments to investigate mineral stabilities and rock histories each of the curves plotted in the fugacity temperature diagram is for an oxidation reaction occurring in a buffer these redox buffers are listed

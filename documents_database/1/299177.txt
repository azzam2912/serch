this theory proposed by t a witten jr and l m sander in 1981 is applicable to aggregation in any system where diffusion is the primary means of transport in the system dla can be observed in many systems such as electrodeposition hele shaw flow mineral deposits and dielectric breakdown the clusters formed in dla processes are referred to as brownian trees these clusters are an example of a fractal in 2d these fractals exhibit a dimension of approximately 1 71 for free particles that are unrestricted by a lattice however computer simulation of dla on a lattice will change the fractal dimension slightly for a dla in the same embedding dimension some variations are also observed depending on the geometry of the growth whether it be from a single point radially outward or from a plane or line for example two examples of aggregates generated using a microcomputer by allowing random walkers to adhere to an aggregate originally i a straight line consisting of 1300 particles and ii one particle at center are shown on the right computer simulation of dla is one of the primary means of studying this model several methods are available to accomplish this simulations

the device is situated in a drift mine shaft in the old kamiokande cavity in the japanese alps the site is surrounded by 53 japanese commercial nuclear reactors nuclear reactors produce electron antineutrinos formula 1 during the decay of radioactive fission products in the nuclear fuel like the intensity of light from a light bulb or a distant star the isotropically emitted formula 1 flux decreases at 1 r per increasing distance r from the reactor the device is sensitive up to an estimated 25 of antineutrinos from nuclear reactors that exceed the threshold energy of 1 8 megaelectronvolts mev and thus produces a signal in the detector if neutrinos have mass they may oscillate into flavors that an experiment may not detect leading to a further dimming or disappearance of the electron antineutrinos kamland is located at an average flux weighted distance of approximately 180 kilometers from the reactors which makes it sensitive to the mixing of neutrinos associated with large mixing angle lma solutions to the solar neutrino problem the kamland detector s outer layer consists of an 18 meter diameter stainless steel containment vessel with an inner lining of 1 879 photo multiplier tubes 1325 17 and

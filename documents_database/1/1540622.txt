it is generated by the friction of the water moving over the surface of the substrate the thickness of this zone is determined by many factors including the coriolis force the zone is of interest to biologist geologists sedimentologists oceanographers physicists and engineers as well as many other scientific disciplines it is the area of interaction between the two environments and as such is important in many species reproductive strategies particularly larvae dispersal the benthic boundary layer also contains nutrients important in fisheries a wide array of microscopic life a variety of suspended materials and sharp energy gradients it is also the sink for many anthropogenic substances released into the environment the benthic boundary layer bbl represents a few tens of meters of the water column directly above the sea floor and constitutes an important zone of biological activity in the ocean it plays a vital role in the cycling of matter and has been called the endpoint for sedimenting material which fuels high metabolic rates for microbial populations after passing through the bbl this degraded material is either returned to the water column or mobilized into the sediment where it may eventually become immobilized with growing concern over the

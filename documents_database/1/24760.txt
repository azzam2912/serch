it combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed wing aircraft for vertical flight the rotors are angled so the plane of rotation is horizontal lifting the way a helicopter rotor does as the aircraft gains speed the rotors are progressively tilted forward with the plane of rotation eventually becoming vertical in this mode the wing provides the lift and the rotor provides thrust as a propeller since the rotors can be configured to be more efficient for propulsion e g with root tip twist and it avoids a helicopter s issues of retreating blade stall the tiltrotor can achieve higher speeds than helicopters a tiltrotor aircraft differs from a tiltwing in that only the rotor pivots rather than the entire wing this method trades off efficiency in vertical flight for efficiency in stol stovl operations the idea of constructing vertical take off and landing vtol aircraft using helicopter like rotors at the wingtips originated in the 1930s the first design resembling modern tiltrotors was patented by george lehberger in may 1930 but he did not further develop the concept in world war ii a german prototype the focke achgelis fa

the mathematician srinivasa ramanujan discovered the congruences this means that in his 1919 paper he proved the first two congruences using the following identities using q pochhammer symbol notation he then stated that it appears there are no equally simple properties for any moduli involving primes other than these after ramanujan died in 1920 g h hardy extracted proofs of all three congruences from an unpublished manuscript of ramanujan on p n ramanujan 1921 the proof in this manuscript employs the eisenstein series in 1944 freeman dyson defined the rank function and conjectured the existence of a crank function for partitions that would provide a combinatorial proof of ramanujan s congruences modulo 11 forty years later george andrews and frank garvan successfully found such a function and proved the celebrated result that the crank simultaneously explains the three ramanujan congruences modulo 5 7 and 11 in the 1960s a o l atkin of the university of illinois at chicago discovered additional congruences for small prime moduli for example extending the results of a atkin ken ono in 2000 proved that there are such ramanujan congruences modulo every integer coprime to 6 for example his results give later ken ono conjectured

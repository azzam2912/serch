this process includes the understanding of its use previous experience with the object and how it relates to others regardless of an object s position or illumination humans possess the ability to effectively identify and label an object humans are one of the few species that possess the ability of invariant visual object recognition both front end knowledge goal driven and back end sensory driven processing are required for a species to be able to recognize objects at varying distances angles lighting etc one model of object recognition based on neuropsychological evidence provides information that allows us to divide the process into four different stages within these stages there are more specific processes that take place to complete the different processing components in addition other existing models propose integrative hierarchies top down and bottom up as well as parallel processing as opposed to this general bottom up hierarchy visual recognition processing has been typically viewed as a bottom up hierarchy in which information is processed sequentially with increasing complexities where lower level cortical processors such as the primary visual cortex are at the bottom of the processing hierarchy and higher level cortical processors such as the inferotemporal cortex it are

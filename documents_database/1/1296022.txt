the growth type of the dehn function is a quasi isometry invariant of a finitely presented group the dehn function of a finitely presented group is also closely connected with non deterministic algorithmic complexity of the word problem in groups in particular a finitely presented group has solvable word problem if and only if the dehn function for a finite presentation of this group is recursive see theorem 2 1 in the notion of a dehn function is motivated by isoperimetric problems in geometry such as the classic isoperimetric inequality for the euclidean plane and more generally the notion of a filling area function that estimates the area of a minimal surface in a riemannian manifold in terms of the length of the boundary curve of that surface the idea of an isoperimetric function for a finitely presented group goes back to the work of max dehn in 1910s dehn proved that the word problem for the standard presentation of the fundamental group of a closed oriented surface of genus at least two is solvable by what is now called dehn s algorithm a direct consequence of this fact is that for this presentation the dehn function satisfies dehn n

as they keep drifting they produce long narrow furrows most often called gouges or scours this phenomenon is common in offshore environments where ice is known to exist although it also occurs in rivers and lakes it appears to be better documented from oceans and sea expanses seabed scours produced via this mechanism should not be confused with strudel scours these result from spring run off water flowing onto the surface of a given sea ice expanse which eventually drains away through cracks seal breathing holes etc the resulting turbulence is strong enough to carve a depression into the seabed seabed scouring by ice should also be distinguished from another scouring mechanism the erosion of the sediments around a structure due to water currents a well known issue in ocean engineering and river hydraulics see bridge scour it appears charles darwin speculated in 1855 about the possibility that icebergs could gouge the seabed as they drifted across isobaths some discussion on the involvement of sea ice was brought up in the 1920s but overall this phenomenon remained poorly studied by the scientific community up to the 1970s at that time ship borne sidescan sonar surveys in the canadian beaufort sea

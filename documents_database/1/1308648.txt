he invented various methods to improve the rifled gun particularly ball grooves not to be confused with the mini ball captain tamisier obtained a patent in 1841 for a method to improve the accuracy of cylindro conical shot by cutting three sharp grooves french cannelures on the cylindrical part of the shot compared to round shots which offered a rather inefficient but symmetric and stable aerodynamic round profile the aerodynamic stability of the cylindro conical shot had been an issue in early rifled weapons of the type developed by delvigne through tamisier s method the resistance of the air behind the center of gravity of the shot was increased thereby increasing its stability the tamisier grooves greatly improved the efficiency of the cylindro conical bullet however they rendered the forcing of the bullet against the grooves of the rifle bore in the delvigne system rather difficult to accommodate this difficulty the stem rifle was developed by thouvenin these principles were later incorporated in the design of the mini ball tamisier also developed a method for making rifle grooves which was original in that the grooves were deeper at the breech and progressively shallower towards the muzzle this provided for a

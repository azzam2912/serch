there is therefore considerable potential for further hydro development hydroelectric plants in china have a relatively low productivity with an average capacity factor of 31 a possible consequence of rushed construction and the seasonal variability of rainfall moreover a significant amount of energy is lost due to the need for long transmission lines to connect the remote plants to where demand is most concentrated although hydroelectricity represents the largest renewable and low greenhouse gas emissions energy source in the country the social and environmental impact of dam construction in china has been large with millions of people forced to relocate and large scale damage to the environment the first hydroelectric power plant in china was built in yunnan province in 1912 with a capacity of 240 kw due to the subsequent period of political and social instability little additional progress was made in power infrastructure in the country at that time the total installed capacity before the japanese occupation was only about 10 mw during the japanese occupation several large scale hydroelectric projects were built and total capacity reached 900 mw energy infrastructure however suffered heavy damage during the second world war and the operational capacity after the war was

for a prospective real estate investor a lower grm represents a better opportunity the grm is useful for comparing and selecting investment properties where depreciation effects periodic costs such as property taxes and insurance and costs to the investor incurred by a potential renter such as utilities and repairs can be expected to be uniform across the properties either as uniform values or uniform fractions of the gross rental income or insignificant in comparison to gross rental income as these costs are also often more difficult to predict than market rental return the grm serves as an alternative to a measure of net investment return where such a measure would be difficult to determine example 200 000 sale price 750 per month rent 12 months 22 22 today it is quite common for grm to be quoted by real estate professionals using annual rents rather than monthly rents a 100 grm monthly rents 8 33 grm annual rents an 8 33 grm calculated on annual rents suggests the gross rent will pay for the property in 8 33 years the common measure of rental real estate value based on net return rather than gross rental income is the capitalization rate

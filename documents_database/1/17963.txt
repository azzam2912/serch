the goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators decision making process examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems hand tools heavy machinery operator controls and process controls the design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology generally the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface which makes it easy efficient and enjoyable user friendly to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result this generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the human user interfaces are composed of one or more layers including a human machine interface hmi interfaces machines with physical input hardware such a keyboards mice game pads and output hardware such as computer monitors speakers and printers a device that implements a hmi is called a human interface device hid other terms for human machine interfaces are man machine interface mmi and

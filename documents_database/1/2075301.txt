it is the earliest true map of london as opposed to panoramic views such as those of anton van den wyngaerde the original map was probably designed for hanging on a wall and is believed to have measured approximately high by wide no copies of the printed map itself are known to have survived but between 1962 and 1997 three of the original engraved copper printing plates from a probable total of 15 were identified although only a fragmentary portion of the map is known the three plates cover the greater part of the built up heart of the city of london the map takes the form of a bird s flight view that is to say the street layout and other ground features are shown in plan as if viewed directly from above while buildings people and other standing features are shown as if viewed from a great height to the south of the city but without the foreshortening of more distant features that would be necessary for a true perspective view the map is clearly the source for the slightly smaller scale and cruder woodcut map formerly attributed to ralph agas which dates from shortly after 1561 and

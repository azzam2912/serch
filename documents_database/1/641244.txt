it was widely used to diagnose infections particularly with microbes that are not easily detected by culture methods and in rheumatic diseases however in clinical diagnostics labs it has been largely superseded by other serological methods such as elisa and by dna based methods of pathogen detection particularly pcr the complement system is a system of serum proteins that react with antigen antibody complexes if this reaction occurs on a cell surface it will result in the formation of trans membrane pores and therefore destruction of the cell the basic steps of a complement fixation test are as follows if the patient s serum contains antibodies against the antigen of interest they will bind to the antigen in step 3 to form antigen antibody complexes the complement proteins will react with these complexes and be depleted thus when the srbc antibody complexes are added in step 4 there will be no complement left in the serum however if no antibodies against the antigen of interest are present the complement will not be depleted and it will react with the srbc antibody complexes added in step 4 lysing the srbcs and spilling their contents into the solution thereby turning the solution

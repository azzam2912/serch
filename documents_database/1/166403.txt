the chromed layer can be decorative provide corrosion resistance ease cleaning procedures or increase surface hardness sometimes a less expensive imitator of chrome may be used for aesthetic purposes chrome plating a component typically includes these stages there are many variations to this process depending on the type of substrate being plated different substrates need different etching solutions such as hydrochloric hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids ferric chloride is also popular for the etching of nimonic alloys sometimes the component enters the chrome plating vat while electrically live sometimes the component has a conforming anode made from lead tin or platinized titanium a typical hard chrome vat plates at about per hour various finishing and buffing processes are used in preparing components for decorative chrome plating the chrome plating chemicals are very toxic disposal of chemicals is regulated in most countries some common industry specifications governing the chrome plating process are ams 2460 ams 2406 and mil std 1501 hexavalent chromium plating also known as hex chrome cr and chrome vi plating uses chromium trioxide also known as chromic anhydride as the main ingredient hexavalent chromium plating solution is used for decorative and hard plating along with bright dipping of copper

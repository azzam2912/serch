mils are used in adjustment of firearm sights by adjusting the angle of the sight compared to the barrel up down left or right mils are also used for comparing shot groupings or to compare the difficulty of hitting different sized shooting targets at different distances when using a scope with both mil adjustment and a reticle with mil markings called a mil mil scope the shooter can use the reticle as a ruler to count the number of mils a shot was off target which directly translates to the sight adjustment needed to hit the target with a follow up shot optics with mil markings in the reticle can also be used to make a range estimation of a known size target or vice versa to determine a target size if the distance is known a practice called milling milliradians are generally used for very small angles which allows for precise mathematical simplifications to more easily calculate back and forth between the angular separation observed in an optic linear subtension on target and range in such applications it is useful to use a unit for target size that is a thousandth of the unit for range for instance by

optimum pulse shape depends on the application these can be found in pulse waves square waves boxcar functions and rectangular functions in digital signals the up and down transitions between high and low levels are called the rising edge and the falling edge in digital systems the detection of these sides or action taken in response is termed edge triggered rising or falling depending on which side of rectangular pulse a digital timing diagram is an example of a well ordered collection of rectangular pulses a nyquist pulse is one which meets the nyquist isi criterion and is important in data transmission an example of a pulse which meets this condition is the sinc function the sinc pulse is of some significance in signal processing theory but cannot be produced by a real generator for reasons of causality in 2013 nyquist pulses were produced in an effort to reduce the size of pulses in optical fibers which enables them to be packed 10x more closely together yielding a corresponding 10x increase in bandwidth the pulses were more than 99 percent perfect and were produced using a simple laser and modulator a gaussian pulse is shaped as a gaussian function and

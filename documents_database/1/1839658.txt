the promoter and first nine exons of srgap2 duplicated from 1q23 1 srgap2a to 1q21 1 srgap2b 3 4 million years ago mya two larger duplications later copied srgap2b to chromosome 1p12 srgap2c and to proximal 1q21 1 srgap2d 2 4 and 1 mya respectively ancestral srgap2a and the derived srgap2c copy are fixed at diploid copy number two in contrast the srgap2b and srgap2d are highly copy number polymorphic with normal individuals identified that completely lack these paralogscopies srgap2c is the most likely duplicate to encode a functional protein and is among the most fixed human specific duplicate genes incomplete duplication created a novel gene function antagonizing parental srgap2 function immediately at birth 2 3 mya which is a time corresponding to the transition from australopithecus to homo and the beginning of neocortex expansion srgap2c is expressed in the human brain and dimerizes with ancestral srgap2 to antagonize it in the mouse neocortex srgap2 promotes spine maturation and limits spine density srgap2c phenocopies srgap2 deficiency and underlies sustained radial migration and results in the emergence of human specific features including neoteny during spine maturation and increased density of longer spines it appears that the srgap2c ultimately assumed the antagonistic

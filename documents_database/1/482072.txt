the majority of the na ayb ks live in the nagaybaksky and chebarkulsky districts of the chelyabinsk oblast they speak a sub dialect of the tatar language s middle dialect russian and tatar historians usually treat the na ayb ks as an integral part of volga tatars a minority considers na ayb ks a separate ethnicity in their own right in the 1989 russian census 11 200 people identified themselves as na ayb ks falling to 9 600 in 2002 the origins of the na ayb ks are unclear one theory places the na ayb ks as an offshoot of the nogais other accounts claim that they are volga tatars baptized after the fall of kazan khanate the most plausible theory according to the 1994 russian encyclopedia says that the ancestors of the na ayb ks traditionally lived in central districts of the khanate east of kazan and most likely descended from nogay and kipchak people in the 18th century they also assimilated a small group of christians from iran and central asia the most popular theory in tatarstan is that they were serving tatars from kazan khanate that were forcibly baptized by ivan iv and relocated to the border

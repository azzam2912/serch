mathematically it is a demonstration of the theorem that su 2 which double covers so 3 is simply connected to say that su 2 double covers so 3 essentially means that the unit quaternions represent the group of rotations twice over resting a small plate flat on the palm it is possible to perform two rotations of one s hand while keeping the plate upright after the first rotation of the hand the arm will be twisted but after the second rotation it will end in the original position to do this the hand makes one rotation passing over its shoulder twisting the arm and then another rotation passing under that untwists it there is a balinese candle dance where an open cup of liquid is held instead of a plate since the feet can remain fixed during the manoeuvre but the hand rotates twice and all the arm and shoulder and other body segments smoothly connect the feet to the hand and undergo the intermediate rotations then the rotation loops that each segment undergoes are progressively collapsed as one progresses from the hand along the arm to the shoulder torso legs and finally the feet which represent the collapse

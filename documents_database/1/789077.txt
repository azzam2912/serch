this bright red ammonium salt is an important reagent in the chemistry of molybdenum and has been used as a building block in bioinorganic chemistry the thiometallate anion has the distinctive property of undergoing oxidation at the sulfur centers concomitant with reduction of the metal from mo vi to mo iv the salt contains the tetrahedral mos anion the compound is prepared by treating solutions of molybdate moo with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of ammonia the anion is also an excellent ligand for example with ni ii sources it forms ni mos much of the chemistry of the thiomolybdate results from studies on salts of quaternised organic cations such as net mos and pph mos et ch ph ch these organic salts are soluble in polar organic solvents such as acetonitrile and dmf the thermal decomposition of nh mos leads to molybdenum trisulfide mos ammonia nh and hydrogen sulfide hs beginning at 155 c till 280 c mos then decomposes again to molybdenum disulfide mos in a broad temperature range from 300 c to 820 c perfect decomposition to mos under inert gas requires at least 800 c according to the following reaction but it can also be achieved

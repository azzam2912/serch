zifs are composed of tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal ions e g fe co cu zn connected by imidazolate linkers since the metal imidazole metal angle is similar to the 145 si o si angle in zeolites zifs have zeolite like topologies as of 2010 105 zif topologies have been reported in the literature due to their robust porosity resistance to thermal changes and chemical stability zif s are being investigated for applications such as carbon capture zifs are prepared by solvothermal or hydrothermal techniques crystals slowly grow from a heated solution of a hydrated metal salt an imh imidazole with acidic proton a solvent and base functionalized imh linkers allow for control of zif structure this process is ideal for generating monocrystalline materials for single crystal x ray diffraction a wide range of solvents bases and conditions have been explored with an eye towards improving crystal functionality morphology and dispersity prototypically an amide solvent such as n n dimethylformamide dmf is used the heat applied decomposes the amide solvent to generate amines which in turn generate the imidazolate from the imidazole species methanol ethanol isopropanol and water have also been explored as alternative solvents for zif formation but require bases

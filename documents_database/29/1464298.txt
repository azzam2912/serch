with applications ranging from the design of submarine hulls to the mechanical properties of cell wall the equations are notoriously difficult to solve and take the following form where is the young s modulus of the plate material assumed homogeneous and isotropic is the poisson s ratio is the thickness of the plate is the out of plane deflection of the plate is the external normal force per unit area of the plate is the cauchy stress tensor and are indices that take values of 1 and 2 the two orthogonal in plane directions the 2 dimensional biharmonic operator is defined as equation 1 above can be derived from kinematic assumptions and the constitutive relations for the plate equations 2 are the two equations for the conservation of linear momentum in two dimensions where it is assumed that the out of plane stresses are zero while the f ppl von k rm n equations are of interest from a purely mathematical point of view the physical validity of these equations is questionable ciarlet states the two dimensional von karman equations for plates originally proposed by von karman 1910 play a mythical role in applied mathematics while they have been abundantly

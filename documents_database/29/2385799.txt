mullin is an american chemist and professor at the university of maryland she is a fellow of the american physical society the american association for the advancement of science and the optical society of america her research focuses on molecular dynamics amy s mullin has a b a in chemistry from university of california santa cruz 1985 and a ph d in physical chemistry from the university of colorado boulder in 1991 with w carl lineberger she was an aauw american postdoctoral fellow at columbia university working with george w flynn 1992 1994 mullin uses time resolved laser spectroscopy to investigate how energy is used in chemical processes and molecular collisions this includes transient spectroscopy of collisions where molecules are excited to very high energy states with pulsed lasers and studied with time resolved high resolution optical absorption in order to investigate the relationship between molecular structure and collision dynamics driving chemical reactions with vibrational energy where high resolution optical probing is used to investigate how chemical reactions are affected by large amounts of vibrational energy of the reacting molecules at a quantum state resolved level and spinning molecules into reactive states using ultrafast lasers to investigate molecules in the

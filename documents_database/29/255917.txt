to the north northeast is the comparably sized crater sharp northwest of mairan is the heavily eroded louville the outer rim of mairan has not been significantly eroded or impacted and retains a sharp edge the surface around mairan is rough and irregular with a multitude of many tiny craters particularly to the south and west the inner walls display some terracing and flow down to a relatively flat interior floor in the mare due west of mairan is a small lunar dome designated mairan t with tiny crater at the summit in official iau nomenclature this name refers only to the crater its width is about 7 km and height is about 800 m it is one of unusually steep and bright domes which are thought to be formed by very viscous high si lava there is a sinuous rille along the southwest edge of the highland peninsula containing mairan it is designated rima mairan and follows a north south course for a length of about 100 kilometers by convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to mairan

implemented as part of the quartzcore framework of mac os x 10 4 and later core image provides a plugin based architecture for applying filters and effects within the quartz graphics rendering layer the framework was later added to ios in ios 5 core image abstracts the pixel level manipulation process required when applying a filter to an image making it simple for applications to implement image transformation capabilities without extensive coding in a simple implementation core image applies a single image filter to the pixel data of a given source to produce the transformed image each image filter specifies a single transform or effect either built into core image or loaded from a plugin called an image unit combined with preset or user defined input parameters the filter can be applied to the original pixel data without modifying it thereby providing non destructive image editing like photoshop core image can apply multiple filters to the same image source instead of applying a series of filters individually core image assembles a dynamic instruction pipeline so that only one calculation needs to be applied to the pixel data to achieve a cumulative effect applying the pixel operations associated with multiple filters

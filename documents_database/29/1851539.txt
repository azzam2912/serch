it is the opposite of speciation and is much more rare it is similar to extinction in that there is a loss of a unique species but without the associated loss of a biological lineage despeciation has been noted in species of butterflies sunflowers mosquitoes fish wolves and even humans a prime example of despeciation is convergent evolution due to the fact that it causes two species that live in same environment to become the same due to the similar functions and behaviors that it must partake in to survive in that habitat common examples of convergent evolution are mullerian and batesian mimicry batesian mimicry is when one species that is harmless mimics a more threatening or intimidating species as to prevent it from being killed mullerian mimicry is when two organisms mimic each other as to prevent either species from being killed by predators despeciation also occurs when two diverged species begin to interact in the same region as in the case of holarctic and californian ravens in north america holarctic ravens and californian ravens had been two separate species for 1 5 million years until tens of thousands of years ago when their regions overlapped and they began

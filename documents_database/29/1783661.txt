the equation was derived independently by both the british mathematician sydney chapman and the russian mathematician andrey kolmogorov suppose that f is an indexed collection of random variables that is a stochastic process let be the joint probability density function of the values of the random variables f to f then the chapman kolmogorov equation is i e a straightforward marginalization over the nuisance variable when the stochastic process under consideration is markovian the chapman kolmogorov equation is equivalent to an identity on transition densities in the markov chain setting one assumes that i markov property where the conditional probability formula 4 is the transition probability between the times formula 5 so the chapman kolmogorov equation takes the form informally this says that the probability of going from state 1 to state 3 can be found from the probabilities of going from 1 to an intermediate state 2 and then from 2 to 3 by adding up over all the possible intermediate states 2 when the probability distribution on the state space of a markov chain is discrete and the markov chain is homogeneous the chapman kolmogorov equations can be expressed in terms of possibly infinite dimensional matrix multiplication thus

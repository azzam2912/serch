it covers the history of domestic commercial and administrative architecture there is little evidence for domestic architecture in wales which predates the 14th century the earliest domestic buildings are the stone tower houses which may date back to about 1400 and various partially fortified first floor hall houses such as candleston castle and eastington at rhoscrowther in pembrokeshire most of the welsh examples are in the southern coastal border area of wales and particularly in pembrokeshire so far no welsh timber framed houses can be securely dated to before 1400 but the description by the poet iolo goch of owain glynd r s house at sycharth shows that houses with timber cruck framing were being built well before this date it has been suggested that the devastation caused following owain glynd r s revolt may have caused the destruction of many earlier timber framed houses in the welsh marches see also welsh tower houses the distribution of tower houses in wales has been discussed by both hilling and smith welsh tower houses most of them built between the early 14th and 15th centuries were rectangular structures consisting of two or more storeys and are closely related to those in ireland

however a recent molecular study has found that the batillariidae as traditionally conceived are not monophyletic the neotropical genera lampanella and rhinocoryne are sister to the planaxidae the monophyletic batillariidae sensu stricto are restricted to the northwestern pacific and australasia a revised generic classification has been suggested that is consistent with a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis accordingly within the batillariidae four genera batillaria pyrazus velacumantus and zeacumantus have been recognized this delimitation of taxa is consistent with a revised definition of the family based on shell characters batillarids are abundant on sandy mudflats and sometimes on rocky shores on continental margins in the warm temperate to tropical regions of the northwestern pacific ocean australasia and the americas batillariids appeared in the late cretaceous or palaeocene and the extinct genera pyrazopsis vicinocerithium and granulolabium became diverse in the tethyan realm before the group disappeared from europe at the end of the miocene the batillariidae s s reached australia and new zealand by the late oligocene and the genera pyrazus velacumantus and zeacumantus still survive in this refugium of tethyan fauna two lineages batillaria and the extinct tateiwaia migrated north to china and japan in the early miocene to establish the present disjunct

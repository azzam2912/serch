the sulfate group so can be substituted by other tetrahedral anions with a double negative charge such as tetrafluoroberyllate bef selenate seo chromate cro molybdate mo or tungstates although monofluorophosphates are predicted they have not been described by redistributing charges other anions with the same shape such as phosphate also form langbeinite structures in these the m atom must have a greater charge to balance the extra three negative charges at higher temperatures the crystal structure is cubic p23 however the crystal structure may change to lower symmetries at lower temperatures for example p2 p1 or p222 usually this temperature is well below room temperature but in a few cases the substance must be heated to acquire the cubic structure the crystal structures of langbeinites consist of a network of oxygen vertex connected tetrahedral polyanions such as sulfate and distorted metal ion oxygen octahedra the unit cell contains four formula units in the cubic form the tetrahedral anions are slightly rotated from the main crystal axes when cooled this rotation disappears and the tetrahedra align resulting in lower energy as well as lower crystal symmetry sulfates include dithallium dicadmium sulfate dirubidium dicadmium sulfate dipotassium dicadmium sulfate dithallium manganese sulfate dirubidium

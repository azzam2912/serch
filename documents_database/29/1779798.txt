bacteria such as deinococcus radiodurans are particularly resistant to radiation but are not pathogenic active microbes such as corynebacterium aquaticum pseudomonas putida comamonas acidovorans gluconobacter cerinus micrococcus diversus and rhodococcus rhodochrous have been retrieved from spent nuclear fuel storage pools at the idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory ineel these microbes were again exposed to controlled doses of radiation all the species survived weaker radiation doses with little damage while only the gram positive species survived much larger doses the spores of gram positive bacteria contain storage proteins that bind tightly to dna possibly acting as a protective barrier to radiation damage ionising radiation kills cells indirectly by creating reactive free radicals these free radicals can chemically alter sensitive macromolecules in the cell leading to their inactivation most of the cell s macromolecules are affected by ionising radiation but damage to the dna macromolecule is most often the cause of cell death since dna often contains only a single copy of its genes proteins on the other hand often have several copies so that damage of one will not lead to cell death and in any case may always be re synthesized provided the dna has remained intact ultraviolet radiation

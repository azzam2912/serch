it provides a rigorous justification that were previously considered merely heuristic nonrigourous calculations with infinitesimals were widely used before karl weierstrass sought to replace them with the definition of limit starting in the 1870s see history of calculus for almost one hundred years thereafter mathematicians like richard courant viewed infinitesimals as being naive and vague or meaningless contrary to such views abraham robinson showed in 1960 that infinitesimals are precise clear and meaningful building upon work by edwin hewitt and jerzy o according to howard keisler robinson solved a three hundred year old problem by giving a precise treatment of infinitesimals robinson s achievement will probably rank as one of the major mathematical advances of the twentieth century the history of non standard calculus began with the use of infinitely small quantities called infinitesimals in calculus the use of infinitesimals can be found the foundations of calculus independently developed by gottfried leibniz and isaac newton starting in the 1660s john wallis refined earlier techniques of indivisibles of cavalieri and others by exploiting an infinitesimal quantity he denoted formula 1 in area calculations preparing the ground for integral calculus they drew on the work of such mathematicians as pierre de fermat

the technique is applicable to proteins and enzymes that engage in electron transfer reactions and it is part of the methods available to study enzyme kinetics provided that it makes suitable contact with the electrode surface electron transfer between the electrode and the protein is direct and provided that it is not denatured the protein can be fruitfully interrogated by monitoring current as a function of electrode potential and other experimental parameters various electrode materials can be used special electrode designs are required to address membrane bound proteins small redox proteins such as cytochromes and ferredoxins can be investigated on condition that their electroactive coverage the amount of protein undergoing direct electron transfer is large enough in practice greater than a fraction of pmol cm electrochemical data obtained with small proteins can be used to measure the redox potentials of the protein s redox sites the rate of electron transfer between the protein and the electrode or the rates of chemical reactions such as protonations that are coupled to electron transfer in a cyclic voltammetry experiment carried out with an adsorbed redox protein the oxidation and reduction of each redox site shows as a pair of positive and negative peaks

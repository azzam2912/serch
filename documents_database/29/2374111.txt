coastal plains account for the remaining ten percent most rocks in suriname date to the precambrian these crystalline basement rocks consists of granitoid and acid volcanic rocks with enclaves of predominantly low grade metamorphic geosynclinal rocks in the marowijne area and of probably considerably older rocks in the falawatra group of the bakhuisgebirge and the coronie area there are also small scattered bodies of gabbro and ultramafitite these are about the same age as the granite and volcanics it has been found that the construction of the basement was largely created during the final phase of the trans amazonian orogeny cycle about 1 9 billion years ago this cycle has had a significant influence on the geology of suriname characterized by sedimentation metamorphosis corrugation and magmatism young sediments cover the northern 20 of the country they exist from south to north and from old to young from the coesewine coropina and demarara formations the older onverdacht formation is only accessible at moengo in the coastal area the three first mentioned formations are accessible in the savannah belt the old coastal plain and the marshy young coastal plain they show a slight northward slope the late pleistocene coropina formation and the

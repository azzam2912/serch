the common name comes from the saw like appearance of the ovipositor which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs the name is associated especially with the tenthredinoidea by far the largest superfamily with about 7 000 known species in the entire suborder there are 8 000 described species in more than 800 genera the suborder symphyta is paraphyletic consisting of several basal groups within the order hymenoptera the primary distinction between sawflies and their relatives the apocrita the ants bees and wasps is that the adults lack a wasp waist and instead have a broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax some sawflies are batesian mimics of wasps and bees and the ovipositor can be mistaken for a stinger sawflies vary in length most measuring to the largest known sawfly measured the larvae are caterpillar like but can be distinguished by the number of prolegs and the absence of crochets in sawfly larvae the great majority of sawflies are plant eating though the members of the superfamily orussoidea are parasitic predators include birds insects and small animals the larvae of some species have anti predator adaptations such as regurgitating irritating liquid and

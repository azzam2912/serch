the type and only species is chilesaurus diegosuarezi chilesaurus lived about 145 million years ago mya in the late jurassic period of chile showing a combination of traits from theropods ornithischians and sauropodomorphs this genus has far reaching implications for the evolution of dinosaurs such as whether the traditional saurischian ornithischian split is superior or inferior to the newly proposed group ornithoscelida chilesaurus measured roughly from nose to tail the holotype is a smaller individual of half that length the most unusual feature of chilesaurus is its spatula shaped elongated teeth obliquely pointing forwards such dentition would be unique in the theropoda where it has sometimes been recovered and is typical for a herbivore indicating chilesaurus was a plant eater another adaptation for eating plants is the backward pointing pubic bone in the pelvis making room for a large gut such a pelvic arrangement is typical for the ornithischia which some other studies have allied it with although is also found in some groups of theropoda the hind limb of chilesaurus had become less adapted to running as shown by a small cnemial crest on the front top of the shinbone and a broad foot with a weight bearing first

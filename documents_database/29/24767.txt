it contains an amine group and a carboxylic acid group both attached to the central carbon atom which also carries a methyl group side chain consequently its iupac systematic name is 2 aminopropanoic acid and it is classified as a nonpolar aliphatic amino acid under biological conditions it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated as nh and its carboxyl group deprotonated as co it is non essential to humans as it can be synthesised metabolically and does not need to be present in the diet it is encoded by all codons starting with gc gcu gcc gca and gcg the isomer of alanine left handed is the one that is incorporated into proteins alanine is second only to leucine in rate of occurrence accounting for 7 8 of the primary structure in a sample of 1 150 proteins the right handed form alanine occurs in polypeptides in some bacterial cell walls and in some peptide antibiotics and occurs in the tissues of many crustaceans and molluscs as an osmolyte alanine was first synthesized in 1850 when adolph strecker combined acetaldehyde and ammonia with hydrogen cyanide the amino acid was named alanin in german in reference to

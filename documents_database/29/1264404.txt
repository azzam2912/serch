transportation engineering and maintenance personnel must maintain around the clock service to millions of people each year while maintaining millions of cubic meters of concrete distributed throughout their facilities this infrastructure includes bridges presently only a limited number of accurate and economical techniques exist to test these structures for integrity and safety as well as insure that they meet original design specifications no single technology can locate all physical anomalies in and below the concrete these techniques along with data fusion can assist in the following investigations to name a few infrared thermography and ground penetrating radar have been developed to locate voids and delaminations in concrete structures such as bridge decks highways and airport pavements being able to locate voids and delaminations means the structural maintenance engineer can measure the actual cracking and weakening of concrete pavements before catastrophic failures can occur concrete objects such as bridges emit energy based upon the absolute temperature of its surfaces and the surface temperatures are dependent upon the internal conditions of the concrete these internal conditions can include physical conditions like infrared thermographic radiometer or ir imager locates these anomalous thermal conditions this device can measure hundreds of thousand of individual temperature

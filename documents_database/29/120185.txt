within saprolite spheroidal weathering often creates rounded boulders known as corestones or woolsack of relatively unweathered rock spheroidal weathering is also called onion skin weathering concentric weathering spherical weathering or woolsack weathering spheroidal weathering is the result of chemical weathering of systematically jointed massive rocks including granite dolerite basalt and sedimentary rocks such as silicified sandstone it occurs as the result of the chemical alteration of such rocks along intersecting joints the chemical alteration of the rock results in the formation of abundant secondary minerals such as kaolinite sericite serpentine montmorillonite and chlorite and a corresponding increase in the volume of the altered rock when the joints within bedrock form a 3 dimensional network they subdivided it into separated blocks often in the form of cubes or rectangles that are bounded by these joints because water can penetrate the bedrock along these joints the near surface bedrock will be altered by weathering progressively inward along the faces of these blocks the alteration by weathering of the bedrock will be greatest along the corners of each block followed by the edges and finally the faces of the cube the differences in weathering rates between the corners edges and faces of a

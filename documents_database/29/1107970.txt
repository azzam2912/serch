it is part of a larger family of rgs proteins that control signalling through g protein coupled receptors gpcr rgs2 is thought to have protective effects against myocardial hypertrophy as well as atrial arrhythmias increased stimulation of gs coupled 1 adrenergic receptors and gq coupled 1 adrenergic receptors in the heart can result in cardiac hypertrophy in the case of gq protein coupled receptor gqpcr mediated hypertrophy g q will activate the intracellular affectors phospholipase c and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor to stimulate cell processes which lead to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy rgs2 functions as a gtpase activating protein gap which acts to increase the natural gtpase activity of the g subunit by increasing the gtpase activity of the g subunit rgs2 promotes gtp hydrolysis back to gdp thus converting the g subunit back to its inactive state and reducing its signalling ability both gspcr and gqpcr activation can contribute to cardiac hypertrophy via activation of map kinases as well rgs2 has been shown to decrease phosphorylation of those map kinases and therefore decrease their activation in response to g s signalling in the case of gspcr mediated hypertrophy the main mechanism by which signalling contributes to hypertrophy is through the

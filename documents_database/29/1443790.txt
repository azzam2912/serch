some of these sequence of bytes correspond to instructions the calculator is able to execute but these cannot be entered in the program memory using conventional program entry methods i e using the calculator as described in the user s manual synthetic programming uses a bug in the calculator firmware to enter those byte sequences as a sequence of other instructions then partially skipping halfway through the first instruction so that the calculator believes the end of the first instruction is actually the beginning of a new one it is not clear if the creators behind the hp 41 were aware of all these black holes hp did not officially support these techniques but probably was intrigued by the strange operations and in some cases allowed enthusiasts to practice in their offices and helped to improve it among a whole sense of curiosity it was kept as a kind of wonder even secret in technical schools

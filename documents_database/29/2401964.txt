it is known only from the western central pacific ocean in the southern south china sea only three specimens of this species are known found in borneo vietnam and thailand all of which are over 80 years old the specimens were originally tentatively assigned as belonging to the smalltail shark c porosus but a number of subtle morphometric differences revealed that they belonged to a new carcharinus species referred to as carcharinus sp a it differs from other carcharinus species by the relative position of the second dorsal and anal fins as well as its low vertebral count as no individuals have been identified for over 80 years c obsolerus may be extinct like other members of the c porosus subgroup c obsolerus likely had limited fecundity and lived in shallow waters that are easily accessed by fishermen both of which put it at heavy risk of extinction from overfishing however the rediscovery of the borneo shark c borneensis in 2004 after a long period of no sightings has kept hopes for its possible survival

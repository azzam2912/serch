it is equivalent to the theorem about ratios in similar triangles traditionally it is attributed to greek mathematician thales suppose s is the intersection point of two lines and a b are the intersections of the first line with the two parallels such that b is further away from s than a and similarly c d are the intersections of the second line with the two parallels such that d is further away from s than c the first intercept theorem shows the ratios of the sections from the lines the second the ratios of the sections from the lines as well as the sections from the parallels finally the third shows the ratios of the sections from the parallels the intercept theorem is closely related to similarity it is equivalent to the concept of similar triangles i e it can be used to prove the properties of similar triangles and similar triangles can be used to prove the intercept theorem by matching identical angles you can always place two similar triangles in one another so that you get the configuration in which the intercept theorem applies and conversely the intercept theorem configuration always contains two similar triangles in a

the term whitewater also has a broader meaning applying to any river or creek that has a significant number of rapids the term is also used as an adjective describing boating on such rivers such as whitewater canoeing or whitewater kayaking four factors separately or in combination can create rapids gradient constriction obstruction and flow rate gradient constriction and obstruction are streambed topography factors and are relatively consistent flow rate is dependent upon both seasonal variation in precipitation and snowmelt and upon release rates of upstream dams streambed topography is the primary factor in creating rapids and is generally consistent over time increased flow as during a flood or high rainfall season can make permanent changes to the streambed by displacing rocks and boulders by deposition of alluvium or by creating new channels for flowing water the gradient of a river is the rate at which it changes elevation along its course this loss determines the river s slope and to a large extent its rate of flow velocity shallow gradients produce gentle slow rivers while steep gradients are associated with raging torrents constrictions can form a rapid when a river s flow is forced into a narrower channel this

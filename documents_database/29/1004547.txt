the cavity formed between the layers is pressurized with air producing a rigid structural element which allows large span structures to be achieved the key difference between air supported buildings and inflatable buildings is that air supported buildings require airlocks at all the access points to prevent air being lost when doors are opened since the entire occupied space of the building is pressurized an inflatable building only requires pressurized air within the cavities of the walls and so does not require airlocks since the occupied interior of the building is at normal atmospheric pressure the air contained within the walls of an inflatable building becomes a true structural part of the building the membranes used in the construction of such buildings are typically less than 1mm thick so the amount of membrane used compared to the volume of air contained within the walls is incredibly low typically less than 0 5 this makes inflatable buildings efficient in terms of the amount of raw materials required to construct them the small amount of material used in the construction of inflatable buildings makes them highly portable when a building needs to be moved the air can simply be allowed to escape

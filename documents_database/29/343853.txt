it is universal which means that any logical or arithmetic operation can be constructed entirely of fredkin gates the fredkin gate is a circuit or device with three inputs and three outputs that transmits the first bit unchanged and swaps the last two bits if and only if the first bit is 1 the basic fredkin gate is a controlled swap gate that maps three inputs c i i onto three outputs c o o the c input is mapped directly to the c output if c 0 no swap is performed i maps to o and i maps to o otherwise the two outputs are swapped so that i maps to o and i maps to o it is easy to see that this circuit is reversible i e undoes itself when run backwards a generalized n n fredkin gate passes its first n 2 inputs unchanged to the corresponding outputs and swaps its last two outputs if and only if the first n 2 inputs are all 1 the fredkin gate is the reversible three bit gate that swaps the last two bits if and only if the first bit is 1 it has the useful property that

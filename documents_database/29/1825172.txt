it is one of the main types of protein phosphorylation this transfer is made possible through enzymes called tyrosine kinases tyrosine phosphorylation is a key step in signal transduction and the regulation of enzymatic activity in the summer of 1979 studies of polyomavirus middle t and v src associated kinase activities led to the discovery of tyrosine phosphorylation as a new type of protein modification following the 1979 discovery that src is a tyrosine kinase the number of known distinct tyrosine kinases grew rapidly accelerated by the advent of rapid dna sequencing technology and pcr about one year later researchers discovered an important role for tyrosine phosphorylation in growth factor signaling and proliferation and by extension in oncogenesis through hijacking of growth factor tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways in 1990 receptor tyrosine kinase rtk initiation of intracellular signaling was detected phosphotyrosine p tyr residues on activated rtks are recognized by a phosphodependent binding domain the sh2 domain the recruitment of sh2 domain proteins to autophosphorylated rtks at the plasma membrane is essential for initiating and propagating downstream signaling sh2 domain proteins may have a variety of functions including adaptor proteins to recruit other signaling proteins enzymes that act on membrane molecules

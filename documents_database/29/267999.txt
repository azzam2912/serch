the flux is usually generated by permanent magnets or electromagnets and confined to the path by magnetic cores consisting of ferromagnetic materials like iron although there may be air gaps or other materials in the path magnetic circuits are employed to efficiently channel magnetic fields in many devices such as electric motors generators transformers relays lifting electromagnets squids galvanometers and magnetic recording heads the concept of a magnetic circuit exploits a one to one correspondence between the equations of the magnetic field in an unsaturated ferromagnetic material to that of an electrical circuit using this concept the magnetic fields of complex devices such as transformers can be quickly solved using the methods and techniques developed for electrical circuits some examples of magnetic circuits are similar to the way that electromotive force emf drives a current of electrical charge in electrical circuits magnetomotive force mmf drives magnetic flux through magnetic circuits the term magnetomotive force though is a misnomer since it is not a force nor is anything moving it is perhaps better to call it simply mmf in analogy to the definition of emf the magnetomotive force formula 1 around a closed loop is defined as the mmf represents the

these mitochondrial dynamics first observed over a hundred years ago are important for the health of the cell and defects in dynamics lead to genetic disorders through fusion mitochondria can overcome the dangerous consequences of genetic malfunction the process of mitochondrial fusion involves a variety of proteins that assist the cell throughout the series of events that form this process when cells experience metabolic or environmental stresses mitochondrial fusion and fission work to maintain functional mitochondria an increase in fusion activity leads to mitochondrial elongation whereas an increase in fission activity results in mitochondrial fragmentation the components of this process can influence programmed cell death and lead to neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson s disease such cell death can be caused by disruptions in the process of either fusion or fission the shapes of mitochondria in cells are continually changing via a combination of fission fusion and motility specifically fusion assists in modifying stress by integrating the contents of slightly damaged mitochondria as a form of complementation by enabling genetic complementation fusion of the mitochondria allows for two mitochondrial genomes with different defects within the same organelle to individually encode what the other lacks in doing so these mitochondrial genomes

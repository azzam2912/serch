this action slows the rotation of a shaft such as a vehicle axle either to reduce its rotational speed or to hold it stationary the energy of motion is converted into waste heat which must be dispersed hydraulically actuated disc brakes are the most commonly used form of brake for motor vehicles but the principles of a disc brake are applicable to almost any rotating shaft development of disc type brakes began in england in the 1890s in 1902 the lanchester motor company designed brakes that looked and operated in a similar way to a modern disc brake system even though the disc was thin and a cable activated the brake pad other designs were not practical or widely available in cars for another 60 years successful application began in airplanes before world war ii and even the german tiger tank was fitted with discs in 1942 after the war technological progress began to arrive in the 1950s leading to a critical demonstration of superiority at the 1953 24 hours of le mans race which required braking from high speeds several times per lap the jaguar racing team won using disc brake equipped cars with much of the credit being

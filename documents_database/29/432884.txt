in a best effort network all users obtain best effort service meaning that they obtain unspecified variable bit rate and latency and packet loss depending on the current traffic load this can be contrasted with reliable delivery which can be built on top of best effort delivery possibly without latency and throughput guarantees or with circuit switching schemes which maintain a defined continuous quality of service the postal service delivers letters using a best effort delivery approach the delivery of a certain letter is not scheduled in advance no resources are preallocated in the post office the service will make their best effort to try to deliver a message but the delivery may be delayed if too many letters suddenly arrive at a postal office the sender is not informed if a letter has been delivered successfully conventional telephone networks are not based on best effort communication but on circuit switching during the connection phase of a new call resources are reserved in the telephone exchanges or a busy signal informs the user that the call is blocked due to lack of free capacity an ongoing phone call can never be interrupted due to overloading of the network and is

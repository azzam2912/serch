crosscharge is the world s first conductive charging system for an electric vehicle it connects potentially any ev car battery to the electrical power source while the driver walks away a true park and walk system the system consists of two halves or rather two bars referred as crossbars one installed on the vehicle and one installed on the floor of a garage or in a parking lot the automated ground unit detects the car above it and brings the two pieces together instigating an electric current to flow into the cross point of vehicle side bar charging the ev as the vehicle is parked over the charger the device remains seamlessly connected to the vehicle and brings it to fully charged state ready for the next use some major benefits include maximizing user convenience to promote ev adoption in addition the device in particular has passed all safety regulations and thus is the safest hands free charger to be available on the market crosscharge is expected to be available in the spring of 2013 charging through conduction is based on the age old technology of metal to metal connection the technology involves contact between a charged object and a

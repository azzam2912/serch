among other things a process group is used to control the distribution of a signal when a signal is directed to a process group the signal is delivered to each process that is a member of the group similarly a session denotes a collection of one or more process groups a process may not create a process group that belongs to another session furthermore a process is not permitted to join a process group that is a member of another session that is a process is not permitted to migrate from one session to another when a process replaces its image with a new image by calling one of the codice 1 functions the new image is subjected to the same process group and thus session membership as the old image the distribution of signals to process groups forms the basis of job control employed by shell programs the tty device driver incorporates a notion of a foreground process group to which it sends signals generated by keyboard interrupts notably sigint interrupt sigtstp terminal stop and sigquit quit it also sends the sigttin and sigttou signals to any processes that attempt to read from or write to the terminal and

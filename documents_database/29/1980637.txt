the siege triggered an invasion by an illyrian relief force and ended in the battle of medion with an aetolian defeat earlier in 231 bc after the dissolution of the epirote league the aetolian league had requested the city of medion to join it but the acarnanians refused the aetolians decided to take medion by force beginning the siege in june the king of macedon demetrius ii aetolicus a rival of the aetolian league being himself engaged against the dardanians requested agron of illyria to intervene and help the acarnanians agron accepted and sent a fleet of 100 lembi and 5 000 men to medion this was the largest force any illyrian king had ever assembled the illyrians and macedon were not necessarily allied but the former was instead hired to assault the aetolians at medion as mercenaries for the latter a modern historian erich s gruen says that the fact that demetrius of macedon had to call the illyrians to relieve medion shows that he was incapable of doing so himself this is supported by another historian grainger who says that demetrius was preoccupied in northern macedon in a war against dardania as the illyrians were also at war

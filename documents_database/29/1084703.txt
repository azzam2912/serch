ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength this acceleration results in an ion having the same kinetic energy as any other ion that has the same charge the velocity of the ion depends on the mass to charge ratio heavier ions of the same charge reach lower speeds although ions with higher charge will also increase in velocity the time that it subsequently takes for the ion to reach a detector at a known distance is measured this time will depend on the velocity of the ion and therefore is a measure of its mass to charge ratio from this ratio and known experimental parameters one can identify the ion the potential energy of a charged particle in an electric field is related to the charge of the particle and to the strength of the electric field where e is potential energy q is the charge of the particle and u is the electric potential difference also known as voltage when the charged particle is accelerated into time of flight tube tof tube or flight tube by the voltage u its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy the kinetic energy of any mass is in effect

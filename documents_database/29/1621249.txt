although the have dash ii missile appears to have been flight tested the results of the project remain classified and no production is believed to have been undertaken have dash i was a classified project to develop an air to air missile for use by stealth aircraft the concept developed by the usaf armament laboratory between 1985 and 1988 was extensively studied but failed to produce any flying hardware have dash ii initiated in 1990 was a renewed effort to develop a stealthy air to air missile intended to be used by the advanced tactical fighter the yf 22 and yf 23 and to replace the aim 120 amraam in service have dash ii was designed with a composite body trapezoidal in shape this was intended both to reduce the missile s radar cross section and to resist heat at hypersonic speeds as the missile was intended to operate at mach 5 the body shape also allowed flush external carriage aboard the launching aircraft and provided aerodynamic lift making the missile more maneuverable the prototype have dash ii missiles were recoverable and utilised rocketdyne mk 58 solid fueled rocket motors of the same type used by the aim 7 sparrow

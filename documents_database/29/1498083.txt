in casual usage it is sometimes referred to as a compilation unit a translation unit roughly consists of a source file after it has been processed by the c preprocessor meaning that header files listed in codice 1 directives are literally included sections of code within codice 2 may be included and macros have been expanded a c program consists of units called source files or preprocessing files which in addition to source code includes directives for the c preprocessor a translation unit is the output of the c preprocessor a source file after it has been preprocessed preprocessing notably consists of expanding a source file to recursively replace all codice 1 directives with the literal file declared in the directive usually header files but possibly other source files the result of this step is a preprocessing translation unit further steps include macro expansion of codice 4 directives and conditional compilation of codice 5 directives among others this translates the preprocessing translation unit into a translation unit from a translation unit the compiler generates an object file which can be further processed and linked possibly with other object files to form an executable program note that the preprocessor is in

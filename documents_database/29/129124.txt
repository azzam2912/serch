integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements it occurs after unit testing and before validation testing integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested groups them in larger aggregates applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing some different types of integration testing are big bang mixed sandwich risky hardest top down and bottom up other integration patterns are collaboration integration backbone integration layer integration client server integration distributed services integration and high frequency integration in the big bang approach most of the developed modules are coupled together to form a complete software system or major part of the system and then used for integration testing this method is very effective for saving time in the integration testing process however if the test cases and their results are not recorded properly the entire integration process will be more complicated and may prevent the testing team from achieving the goal of integration testing bottom up testing is an approach to integrated testing where the lowest level components are tested first then used

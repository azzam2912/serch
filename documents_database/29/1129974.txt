specific reactions catalyzed by 17 hsd2 include estradiol to estrone testosterone to androstenedione and androstenediol to in addition to 17 hsd activity this enzyme also shows high 20 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and can activate the weak progestogen 20 hydroxyprogesterone into the potent progestogen progesterone 17 hsd2 is widely expressed throughout the body including in the placenta liver intestines endometrium kidney pancreas breast prostate bone and many other tissues polymorphisms in hsd17b2 have been associated with breast cancer and prostate cancer 17 hsd2 activity has also been associated with endometriosis and osteoporosis and inhibitors of the enzyme are of potential interest in the treatment of the latter condition inactivating mutations resulting in a syndrome of congenital deficiency of 17 hsd2 have not been reported to date

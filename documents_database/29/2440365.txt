a basic example of this is quantum state tomography where a quantum state is learned from measurement other examples include learning hamiltonians learning quantum phase transitions and automatically generating new quantum experiments classical machine learning is effective at processing large amounts of experimental or calculated data in order to characterize an unknown quantum system making its application useful in contexts including quantum information theory quantum technologies development and computational materials design the ability to experimentally control and prepare increasingly complex quantum systems brings with it a growing need to turn large and noisy data sets into meaningful information this is a problem that has already been studied extensively in the classical setting and consequently many existing machine learning techniques can be naturally adapted to more efficiently address experimentally relevant problems for example bayesian methods and concepts of algorithmic learning can be fruitfully applied to tackle quantum state classification hamiltonian learning and the characterization of an unknown unitary transformation other problems that have been addressed with this approach are given in the following list quantum machine learning can also be applied to dramatically accelerate the prediction of quantum properties of molecules and materials this can be helpful for the computational design

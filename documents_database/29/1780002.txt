however in 2015 the international classification of corneal dystrophies ic3d renamed the condition ched1 to become posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy and renamed the condition ched2 to become simply ched consequently the scope of this article is restricted to the condition currently referred to as ched ched presents congenitally but has a stationary course the cornea exhibits a variable degree of clouding from a diffuse haze to a ground glass appearance with occasional focal gray spots the cornea thickens to between two and three times is normal thickness rarely sub epithelial band keratopathy and elevated intraocular pressure occur patients have blurred vision and nystagmus however it is rare for the condition to be associated with either epiphora or photophobia with this ched exhibits autosomal recessive inheritance with 80 of cases linked to mutations in slc4a11 gene the slc4a11 gene encodes solute carrier family 4 sodium borate transporter member 11 histologically the descemet s membrane in ched becomes diffusely thickened and laminated multiple layers of basement membrane like material appear to form on the posterior part of descemet s membrane the endothelial cells are sparse they become atrophic and degenerated with many vacuoles the corneal stroma becomes severely disorganised the lamellar arrangement

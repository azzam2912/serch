a cas is a package comprising a set of algorithms for performing symbolic manipulations on algebraic objects a language to implement them and an environment in which to use the language a cas may include a user interface and graphics capability and to be effective may require a large library of algorithms efficient data structures and a fast kernel these computer algebra systems are sometimes combined with front end programs that provide a better user interface such as the general purpose gnu texmacs below is a summary of significantly developed symbolic functionality in each of the systems those which do not edit equations may have a gui plotting ascii graphic formulae and math font printing the ability to generate plaintext files is also a sought after feature because it allows a work to be understood by people who do not have a computer algebra system installed the software can run under their respective operating systems natively without emulation some systems must be compiled first using an appropriate compiler for the source language and target platform for some platforms only older releases of the software may be available some graphing calculators have cas features

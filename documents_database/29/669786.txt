semantic services are a component of the semantic web because they use markup which makes data machine readable in a detailed and sophisticated way as compared with human readable html which is usually not easily understood by computer programs the mainstream xml standards for interoperation of web services specify only syntactic interoperability not the semantic meaning of messages for example web services description language wsdl can specify the operations available through a web service and the structure of data sent and received but cannot specify semantic meaning of the data or semantic constraints on the data this requires programmers to reach specific agreements on the interaction of web services and makes automatic web service composition difficult semantic web services are built around universal standards for the interchange of semantic data which makes it easy for programmers to combine data from different sources and services without losing meaning web services can be activated behind the scenes when a web browser makes a request to a web server which then uses various web services to construct a more sophisticated reply than it would have been able to do on its own semantic web services can also be used by automatic programs that

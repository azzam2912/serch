tolkien in a creative attempt to reconstruct the folktale underlying the narrative in the first two thousand lines of the old english poem beowulf among other things it seeks to clarify and integrate a number of narrative strands in the anglo saxon poem the resulting text is a loose variant of the skilful companions type of folktale in which each of several characters two or three in tolkien s text depending on the redaction has a valuable but specific skill unlike in folktales of that type however the skills of tolkien s characters do not supplement each other in the resolution of the narrative problem tolkien s recasting of the material also incorporates the sluggish youth motif and the abandonment of the hero at the waterfall both elements found in the analogous old icelandic grettis saga the suggestion that a waterfall like that of grettis saga was part of the original setting of the pool of monsters in beowulf was made by w w lawrence in 1912 the text s editor christopher tolkien dates much of the composition and revision of the tale to the early 1940s on the basis of datable content on the versos of the manuscript leaves

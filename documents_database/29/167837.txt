that is it is a set formula 1 of vertices such that for every two vertices in formula 1 there is no edge connecting the two equivalently each edge in the graph has at most one endpoint in formula 1 the size of an independent set is the number of vertices it contains independent sets have also been called internally stable sets a maximal independent set is either an independent set such that adding any other vertex to the set forces the set to contain an edge or the set of all vertices of the empty graph a maximum independent set is an independent set of largest possible size for a given graph formula 4 this size is called the independence number of formula 4 and denoted formula 6 the problem of finding such a set is called the maximum independent set problem and is an np hard optimization problem as such it is unlikely that there exists an efficient algorithm for finding a maximum independent set of a graph every maximum independent set also is maximal but the converse implication does not necessarily hold a set is independent if and only if it is a clique in the graph

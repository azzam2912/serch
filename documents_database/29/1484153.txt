the discrepancy was first observed in the mid 1960s and finally resolved around 2002 the flux of neutrinos at earth is several tens of billions per square centimetre per second mostly from the sun s core they are nevertheless hard to detect because they interact very weakly with matter traversing the whole earth as light does thin air of the three types flavors of neutrinos known in the standard model of particle physics the sun produces only electron neutrinos when neutrino detectors became sensitive enough to measure the flow of electron neutrinos from the sun the number detected was much lower than predicted in various experiments the number deficit was between one half and two thirds particle physicists knew that a mechanism discussed back in 1957 by bruno pontecorvo could explain the deficit in electron neutrinos however they hesitated to accept it for various reasons including the fact that it required a modification of the accepted standard model they first pointed at the solar model for adjustment which was ruled out today it is accepted that the neutrinos produced in the sun are not massless particles as predicted by the standard model but rather mixed quantum states made up of

it was discovered on 1 january 2014 by richard kowalski at the mount lemmon survey at an apparent magnitude of 19 using a reflecting telescope at mount lemmon observatory 2014 aa was only observed over a short observation arc of about 70 minutes and entered earth s atmosphere about 21 hours after discovery nonetheless it remains one of only a few asteroids observed before impact see asteroid impact prediction using a poorly determined orbit the jpl small body database listed a 3 sigma solution with impact occurring around 2 january 2014 02 33 ut 1 hour and 5 minutes the minor planet center listed impact as occurring around 2 january 2014 05 00 ut 10 hours independent calculations by bill gray the minor planet center and steve chesley at the jet propulsion laboratory verified that impact was virtually certain the impactor would have been roughly the size of which exploded above the nubian desert in sudan on 7 october 2008 calculations by chesley suggest the impactor fell somewhere on an arc extending from central america to east africa with a best fit location just off the coast of west africa calculations by pasquale tricarico using the nominal orbit show that

the canal west of pontcysyllte aqueduct and the construction of the weir were authorised by an act of parliament obtained in 1804 by the ellesmere canal company the canal was a navigable feeder which supplied water to the ellesmere canal beyond pontcysyllte and to the chester canal to which it connected near nantwich thomas telford was the civil engineer responsible for the design and the canal and feeder were completed in 1808 the weir was an important factor in the retention of the canal to llangollen when the owners of the entire shropshire union system the london midland and scottish railway decided to close much of the network in 1944 they retained the line of the former chester canal and the ellesmere canal from nantwich to ellesmere port the branch of the chester canal to middlewich and the former birmingham and liverpool junction canal main line from nantwich to wolverhampton because horseshoe falls was a major source of water to that system the canal from llangollen to nantwich including the great aqueducts at pontcysyllte and chirk was retained purely as a water supply channel this action enabled the canal to survive until it was taken over by british waterways following

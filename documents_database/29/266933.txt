specialized versions of paq have won the hutter prize and the calgary challenge paq is free software distributed under the gnu general public license paq uses a context mixing algorithm context mixing is related to prediction by partial matching ppm in that the compressor is divided into a predictor and an arithmetic coder but differs in that the next symbol prediction is computed using a weighted combination of probability estimates from a large number of models conditioned on different contexts unlike ppm a context doesn t need to be contiguous most paq versions collect next symbol statistics for the following contexts all paq versions predict and compress one bit at a time but differ in the details of the models and how the predictions are combined and postprocessed once the next bit probability is determined it is encoded by arithmetic coding there are three methods for combining predictions depending on the version paq1sse and later versions postprocess the prediction using secondary symbol estimation sse the combined prediction and a small context are used to look up a new prediction in a table after the bit is encoded the table entry is adjusted to reduce the prediction error sse stages can

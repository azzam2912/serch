the algorithm is based on a generalization of the birthday problem which finds colliding hash values it has severe time space trade offs but concedes vulnerability to unforeseen parallel optimizations it was designed such that parallel implementations are bottle necked by memory bandwidth in an attempt to worsen the cost performance trade offs of designing custom asic implementations asic resistance in equihash is based on the assumption that commercially sold hardware already has quite high memory bandwidth so improvements made by custom hardware may not be worth the development cost equihash was proposed by alex biryukov and dmitry khovratovich as part of the university of luxembourg research group cryptolux it was introduced at the network and distributed system security symposium 2016 in san diego notable blockchain based projects such as zcash and aion have integrated equihash for reasons such as security privacy and asic miner resistance the manufacturer bitmain has succeeded in optimizing the processing of zcash s equihash 200 9 with an asic equihash has three parameters formula 1 formula 2 and formula 3 which determine the algorithm s time and memory requirements the time complexity is proportional to formula 4while the memory complexity is proportional to formula 5

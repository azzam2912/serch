an energy pulse heats one side of a plane parallel sample and the resulting time dependent temperature rise on the backside due to the energy input is detected the higher the thermal diffusivity of the sample the faster the energy reaches the backside a state of the art laser flash apparatus lfa to measure thermal diffusivity over a broad temperature range is shown on the right hand side in a one dimensional adiabatic case the thermal diffusivity formula 1 is calculated from this temperature rise as follows where the laser flash method was developed by parker et al in 1961 in a vertical setup a light source e g flashlamp heats the sample from the bottom side and a detector on top detects the time dependent temperature rise for measuring the thermal diffusivity which is strongly temperature dependent at different temperatures the sample can be placed in a furnace at constant temperature perfect conditions are several improvements on the models have been made in 1963 cowan takes radiation and convection on the surface into account cape and lehman consider transient heat transfer finite pulse effects and also heat losses in the same year blumm and opfermann improved the cape lehman

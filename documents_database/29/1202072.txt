these effects are mediated by specific nuclear receptor proteins that are members of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of transcriptional regulators rarres1 rarres2 this gene and rarres3 are genes whose expression is upregulated by the synthetic retinoid tazarotene rarres2 is thought to act as a cell surface receptor chemerin is a chemoattractant protein that acts as a ligand for the g protein coupled receptor cmklr1 also known as chemr23 chemerin is a 14 kda protein secreted in an inactive form as prochemerin and is activated through cleavage of the c terminus by inflammatory and coagulation serine proteases chemerin was found to stimulate chemotaxis of dendritic cells and macrophages to the site of inflammation in humans chemerin mrna is highly expressed in white adipose tissue liver and lung while its receptor cmklr1 is predominantly expressed in immune cells as well as adipose tissue because of its role in adipocyte differentiation and glucose uptake chemerin is classified as an adipokine chemerin has been implicated in autocrine paracrine signaling for adipocyte differentiation and also stimulation of lipolysis studies with 3t3 l1 cells have shown chemerin expression is low in pre differentiated adipocytes but its expression and secretion increases both during and

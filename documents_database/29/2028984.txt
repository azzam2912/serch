barriers to a more definitive percentage include the lack of a nationally representative study and the possibility of underreporting due to stigma associated with identifying as lgbt the city from which the sample is drawn for each study may also account for a difference in estimates for example one 2004 study at the university of nebraska lincoln noted that while estimates based on samples from los angeles range from 25 to 40 percent a 1999 study of small and medium midwestern cities concluded that only 6 of homeless youth there identified as lgbt according to the authors of this study geographical location could affect these numbers for example due to the higher risk of coming out in rural midwestern cities youth may be more likely to either stay closeted there or to migrate to larger cities further the authors continue the differences might reflect differences in the ages of the samples in the different studies or other differences in sampling methodology the study concludes that when taken together a general consensus can be found among the studies that 20 of homeless youth in magnet studies identify as gay lesbian or bisexual with the number being slightly lower in nonmagnet cities

nfkbie is able to inhibit nf b directed transactivation via cytoplasmic retention of rel proteins nfkb1 or nfkb2 is bound to rel rela or relb to form the nf b transcription factor complex the nf b complex is inhibited by i kappa b proteins nfkbia or nfkbib which inactivate nf kappa b by trapping it in the cytoplasm phosphorylation of serine residues on the i kappa b proteins by kinases ikbka or ikbkb marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway thereby allowing activation of the nf kappa b complex activated nf b complex translocates into the nucleus and binds dna at kappa b binding motifs such as 5 prime gggrnnyycc 3 prime or 5 prime hggarnyycc 3 prime where h is a c or t r is an a or g purine and y is a c or t pyrimidine for some genes activation requires nf b interaction with other transcription factors such as stat see stat6 ap 1 jun and nfat see nfatc1 nfkbie has been shown to interact with nfkb2 rela nfkb1 and rel

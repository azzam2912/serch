it differs from accretion which describes a gradual addition to land resulting from the action of water the distinction between avulsion and accretion becomes important where a river forms the boundary between two riparian owners in many jurisdictions though not all if the river changes channels by avulsion the boundary does not change it remains in the middle of the old channel for example the mississippi river forms the boundary between several u s states this principle is the reason that states on the lower mississippi have occasional pieces of land on the opposite side from the rest of the state the river changed course quickly in such locations so boundaries did not change however as a river gradually changes through accretion the boundary changes with it to prove that a change was avulsion and not accretion it is sufficient at least under oklahoma law for the owner of land which was washed away to point out approximately as much land added to the opposite bank as washed away from his bank avulsion can also affect littoral owners through events like hurricanes that can rapidly erode a shoreline florida courts have determined that littoral owners have the right to all

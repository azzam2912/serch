it says originally l szl lov sz stated the problem in the opposite way but this version became standard in 1996 l szl babai published a conjecture sharply contradicting this conjecture but both conjectures remain widely open it is not even known if a single counterexample would necessarily lead to a series of counterexamples the problem of finding hamiltonian paths in highly symmetric graphs is quite old as donald knuth describes it in volume 4 of the art of computer programming the problem originated in british campanology bell ringing such hamiltonian paths and cycles are also closely connected to gray codes in each case the constructions are explicit another version of lov sz conjecture states that there are 5 known examples of vertex transitive graphs with no hamiltonian cycles but with hamiltonian paths the complete graph formula 1 the petersen graph the coxeter graph and two graphs derived from the petersen and coxeter graphs by replacing each vertex with a triangle none of the 5 vertex transitive graphs with no hamiltonian cycles is a cayley graph this observation leads to a weaker version of the conjecture the advantage of the cayley graph formulation is that such graphs correspond to a

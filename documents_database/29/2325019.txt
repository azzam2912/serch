it is an ester of testosterone with phosphoric acid that is in the form of a polymer and is coupled with phloretin like other androgen esters ptpp acts as a long lasting prodrug of testosterone in the body however analogously to the polymeric estrogen esters polyestradiol phosphate pep polyestriol phosphate pe3p and polydiethylstilbestrol phosphate psp ptpp has a strongly prolonged duration with very uniform testosterone levels in animals compared to non polymeric testosterone esters according to its developers this is exactly the effect which should be aimed at in order to approach natural hormone production as closely as possible ptpp was developed around 1953 at the same time as pep and its patent was published in 1960 the patent was assigned to the swedish pharmaceutical company which also developed pep pep is a linear polymer of on average 13 repeat units of estradiol phosphate each individual estradiol unit in the molecule is connected by its c3 and c17 hydroxyl groups to phosphoric acid linkers that are present between the estradiol moieties in contrast to estradiol such a polymer is not possible with testosterone because testosterone has only one hydroxyl group and hence does not have the two hydroxyl groups necessary

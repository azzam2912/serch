it is a type of boundary representation and describes both the geometry and topology of a model three types of records are used vertex records edge records and face records given a reference to an edge record one can answer several types of adjacency queries queries about neighboring edges vertices and faces in constant time this kind of adjacency information is useful for algorithms such as subdivision surface the winged edge data structure explicitly describes the geometry and topology of faces edges and vertices when three or more surfaces come together and meet at a common edge the ordering is such that the surfaces are ordered counter clockwise with respect to the innate orientation of the intersection edge moreover the representation allows numerically unstable situations like that depicted below the winged edge data structure allows for quick traversal between faces edges and vertices due to the explicitly linked structure of the network it serves adjacency queries in constant time with little storage overhead this rich form of specifying an unstructured grid is in contrast to simpler specifications of polygon meshes such as a node and element list or the implied connectivity of a regular grid an alternative to the winged

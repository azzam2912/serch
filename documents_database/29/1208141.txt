these speeds are derived from data obtained by aircraft designers and manufacturers during flight testing for aircraft type certification testing using them is considered a best practice to maximize aviation safety aircraft performance or both the actual speeds represented by these designators are specific to a particular model of aircraft they are expressed by the aircraft s indicated airspeed and not by for example the ground speed so that pilots may use them directly without having to apply correction factors as aircraft instruments also show indicated airspeed in general aviation aircraft the most commonly used and most safety critical airspeeds are displayed as color coded arcs and lines located on the face of an aircraft s airspeed indicator the lower ends of the green arc and the white arc are the stalling speed with wing flaps retracted and stalling speed with wing flaps fully extended respectively these are the stalling speeds for the aircraft at its maximum weight the yellow range is the range in which the aircraft may be operated in smooth air and then only with caution to avoid abrupt control movement and the red line is the v the never exceed speed proper display of v speeds

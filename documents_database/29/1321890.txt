together the copper harbor nonesuch and freda make up the oronto group the nonesuch is middle proterozoic with an estimated age of approximately 1 1 billion years it was deposited in the midcontinent rift the nonesuch beds contain common organic carbon and pyrite the nonesuch formation has been a major source of copper and is considered a prospective source of petroleum copper was discovered in the nonesuch in the 1800s but early mining efforts such as those at the nonesuch mine in ontonagon county michigan failed because of the difficulty of recovering the fine grains of native copper the copper range company opened the white pine mine in ontonagon county michigan in 1955 the principal ore minerals were chalcocite and native copper the underground mine produced copper from the nonesuch shale until it closed in 1995 the nonesuch shale has sufficient organic carbon content greater than 0 5 to be considered a potential sourcebed for petroleum oil identified as precambrian has been found seeping into the white pine copper mine in michigan exploration wells have been drilled to nonesuch equivalent sediments in the rift basins in michigan wisconsin and iowa but no commercial petroleum deposits have been discovered

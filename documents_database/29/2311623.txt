patterns of forest fires in historical and prehistorical time provide information relevant to the pattern of vegetation in modern landscapes it provides an estimate of the historical range of variability of a natural disturbance regime and can be used to identify the processes affecting the occurrence of fire fire history reconstructions are achieved by compiling atlases of past fires using the tree ring record from fire scars and tree ages and the charcoal record from soils and sediments sustained wildfire can only exist once oxygen levels and fuel sources were present in sufficient quantities between 400 and 450 million year ago fire became a feature of the landscape the presence of fusain fossil charcoal beginning in the early carboniferous attests to this fire history and forms an important element of the cretaceous paleogene boundary the growth record of a tree in seasonal climates is preserved in the growth rings in the stem wood the field of dendrochronology is the study of the record of climate and other events preserved in the growth record each growth ring represents one year of life the thickness of each ring indicates the amount of wood produced during that growing season at the beginning of

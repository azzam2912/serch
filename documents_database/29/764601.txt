the developer specifies the original and final states of an object and core animation handles interpolation this allows animated interfaces to be created with relative ease as no specific code for the animation is required by the developer core animation can animate any visual element and it provides a unified way of accessing core image core video and the other quartz technologies core animation rendering can be accelerated by a graphics processor gpu animated sequences execute in a thread independent from the main run loop allowing application processing to occur while the animation is in progress in this way application performance is not affected and animations can be stopped reversed or retargeted while in progress core animation first appeared in mac os x leopard but actually first emerged from the iphone software team it was shown publicly for the first time on august 7 2006 during wwdc 2006 at the macworld expo 2007 apple announced that the iphone runs a specially adapted version of os x and uses core animation

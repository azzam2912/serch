phototrophic bacteria are ubiquitous and have been reportedly found in many marine and terrestrial ecosystems additionally they can use light as an energy source and carbon dioxide as a carbon source considering this r vannielii is thought to have potential application in anaerobic treatment and bioremediation under high temperature conditions as the bacteria was isolated from water samples from a hot spring in gadek malacca malaysia using glutamate malate medium gmm and pfennig s m2 medium r vannielii produces acyclic and aliphatic cyclic carotenoids like anhydrorhodovibrin rhodovibrin spirilloxanthin and rhodopin mature r vannielii cells are typically ovoid to spherical in shape do not form intracellular sulfur globules and are about 2 0 2 5 m long and 1 2 1 5 m wide the cells are then attached by means of slender branched filaments with the connecting filaments varying in length but a uniform diameter of approximately 0 3 microns colonies are irregular in shape and have a rough convoluted surface after observation the cells showed a budding filament formation r vannielli is unique as it is the only species of its genus to reproduce via budding rather than fission r vannielii contains carotenoid pigments which gives its cultures a

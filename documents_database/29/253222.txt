they are broad spectrum inhibitors and are chemically diverse with different types characteristic of particular plant species phytoalexins tend to fall into several classes including terpenoids glycosteroids and alkaloids however researchers often find it convenient to extend the definition to include all phytochemicals that are part of the plant s defensive arsenal phytoalexins produced in plants act as toxins to the attacking organism they may puncture the cell wall delay maturation disrupt metabolism or prevent reproduction of the pathogen in question their importance in plant defense is indicated by an increase in susceptibility of plant tissue to infection when phytoalexin biosynthesis is inhibited mutants incapable of phytoalexin production exhibit more extensive pathogen colonization as compared to wild type as such host specific pathogens capable of degrading phytoalexins are more virulent than those unable to do so when a plant cell recognizes particles from damaged cells or particles from the pathogen the plant launches a two pronged resistance a general short term response and a delayed long term specific response as part of the induced resistance the short term response the plant deploys reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to kill invading cells in pathogen interactions the common

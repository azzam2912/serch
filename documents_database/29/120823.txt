in the days of hand typesetting it referred to the thin strips of lead that were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between lines of type in this case the leading would be defined as the difference between 2 quantities the size of the type and the distance from one baseline to the next for instance given a type size of 10 points and a distance between baselines of 12 points the leading would be 2 points put another way a leading of 2 points means there is a distance of 2 points from the bottom of the high line of type to the top of the low line of type in modern times though there seems to be widespread use of leading to refer instead to just the distance from one baseline to the next probably because modern layout software tracks that quantity instead of a virtual strip of lead the term is still used in modern page layout software such as quarkxpress and adobe indesign in consumer oriented word processing software this concept is usually referred to as line spacing or interline spacing the latter of which is actually a more accurate description of the

however some of these reactions do not seem to bear much or any biological significance for example histamine is biosynthesised strictly via the enzyme histidine decarboxylase in humans and other organisms in normal dopamine and serotonin 5 ht neurotransmitter synthesis aadc is not the rate limiting step in either reaction however aadc becomes the rate limiting step of dopamine synthesis in patients treated with dopa such as in parkinson s disease and the rate limiting step of serotonin synthesis in people treated with 5 htp such as in mild depression or dysthymia aadc is inhibited by carbidopa outside of the blood brain barrier to inhibit the premature conversion of dopa to dopamine in the treatment of parkinson s in humans aadc is also the rate limiting enzyme in the formation of trace amines aromatic l amino acid decarboxylase deficiency is associated with various symptoms as severe developmental delay oculogyric crises and autonomic dysfunction the molecular and clinical spectrum of aaac deficiency is heterogeneous the first case of aadc deficiency was described in twin brothers 1990 patients can be treated with dopamine agonists mao inhibitors and pyridoxine vitamin b clinical phenotype and response to treatment is variable and the long term

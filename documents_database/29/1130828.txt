eif2ak1 exerts its function through the phosphorylation of eif2s1 at ser 48 and ser 51 thus preventing its recycling binds hemin forming a 1 1 complex through a cysteine thiolate and histidine nitrogenous coordination this binding occurs with moderate affinity allowing it to sense the heme concentration within the cell owing to this unique heme sensing capacity it plays a crucial role in shutting off protein synthesis during acute heme deficient conditions in red blood cells rbcs it controls hemoglobin synthesis ensuring a coordinated regulation of the synthesis of the heme and globin moieties of hemoglobin thus plays an essential protective role for rbc survival in anemias of iron deficiency similarly in hepatocytes involved in heme mediated translational control of cyp2b and cyp3a and possibly other hepatic p450 cytochromes eif2ak1 also act to moderate er stress during acute heme deficient conditions eif2ak1 is a kinase thus it catalyses the following reaction atp a protein adp a phosphoprotein eif2ak1 is induced by acute heme depletion that not only increases eif2ak1 protein levels but also stimulates kinase activity by autophosphorylation inhibited by the heme degradation products biliverdin and bilirubin induced by oxidative stress generated by arsenite treatment binding of nitric oxide no

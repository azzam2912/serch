users send a protein sequence and receive a single file with results from database comparisons and prediction methods pp went online in 1992 at the european molecular biology laboratory since 1999 it has operated from columbia university and in 2009 it moved to the technische universit t m nchen although many servers have implemented particular aspects pp remains the most widely used public server for structure prediction over 1 5 million requests from users in 104 countries have been handled over 13000 users submitted 10 or more different queries pp web pages are mirrored in 17 countries on 4 continents the system is optimized to meet the demands of experimentalists not experienced in bioinformatics this implied that we focused on incorporating only high quality methods and tried to collate results omitting less reliable or less important ones the attempt to pre digest as much information as possible to simplify the ease of interpreting the results is a unique pillar of pp for example by default pp returns only those proteins found in the database that are very likely to have a similar structure to the query protein particular predictions such as those for membrane helices coiled coil regions signal peptides

to obtain wind data they can be tracked by radar radio direction finding or navigation systems such as the satellite based global positioning system gps balloons meant to stay at a constant altitude for long periods of time are known as transosondes weather balloons that do not carry an instrument pack are used to determine upper level winds and the height of cloud layers for such balloons a theodolite or total station is used to track the balloon s azimuth and elevation which are then converted to estimated wind speed and direction and or cloud height as applicable one of the first persons to use weather balloons was l on teisserenc de bort the french meteorologist starting in 1896 he launched hundreds of weather balloons from his observatory in trappes france these experiments led to his discovery of the tropopause and stratosphere transosondes weather balloons with instrumentation meant to stay at a constant altitude for long periods of time to help diagnose radioactive debris from atomic fallout were experimented with in 1958 the balloon itself produces the lift and is usually made of a highly flexible latex material though chloroprene may also be used the unit that performs the actual

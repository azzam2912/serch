the error threshold is crucial to understanding eigen s paradox the error threshold is a concept in the origins of life abiogenesis in particular of very early life before the advent of dna it is postulated that the first self replicating molecules might have been small ribozyme like rna molecules these molecules consist of strings of base pairs or digits and their order is a code that directs how the molecule interacts with its environment all replication is subject to mutation error during the replication process each digit has a certain probability of being replaced by some other digit which changes the way the molecule interacts with its environment and may increase or decrease its fitness or ability to reproduce in that environment it was noted by manfred eigen in his 1971 paper eigen 1971 that this mutation process places a limit on the number of digits a molecule may have if a molecule exceeds this critical size the effect of the mutations become overwhelming and a runaway mutation process will destroy the information in subsequent generations of the molecule the error threshold is also controlled by the fitness landscape for the molecules the fitness landscape is characterized by the

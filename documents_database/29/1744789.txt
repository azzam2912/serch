it was designed by bridge engineer and designer homer m hadley the combination of concrete and steel box girders employed in the bridge s represents a variation of the box girder bridge style the patton bridge was the only structure built between 1941 and 1950 which exhibits this innovative modification of the box girder design built in 1950 the patton bridge spans the green river near the city of auburn in king county washington the bridge is a three span cantilever with two anchor arms two cantilever arms and a suspended section it includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders the bridge was designed by homer m hadley a consulting engineer from washington state the anchor arms and cantilever arms are multiple box two cell reinforced concrete box girders the suspended section consists of two spread welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck the concrete deck is fixed to the top flange plate of the girders with steel shear developers utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design i e the bottom flange of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces

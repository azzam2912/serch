this protein has been shown to function in part through the regulation of intracellular ca mobilization the 5 ht receptor has been shown to be functional in a native expression system rodents have been shown to possess two functional 5 ht receptor subtypes 5 ht and 5 ht however while humans possess a gene coding for the 5 ht subtype its coding sequence is interrupted by stop codons making the gene non functional and so only the 5 ht subtype is expressed in human brain it also appears to serve as a presynaptic serotonin autoreceptor the neurotransmitter serotonin 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 ht has been implicated in a wide range of psychiatric conditions and also has vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory effects few highly selective ligands are commercially available for the 5 ht receptor when selective activation of this receptor is desired in scientific research the non selective serotonin receptor agonist 5 carboxamidotryptamine can be used in conjunction with selective antagonists for its other targets principally 5 ht 5 ht 5 ht and 5 ht research in this area is ongoing

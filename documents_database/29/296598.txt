superheated steam is used in steam turbines for electricity generation steam engines and in processes such as steam reforming there are three types of superheaters radiant convection and separately fired a superheater can vary in size from a few tens of feet to several hundred feet a few metres to some hundred metres in a steam engine the superheater re heats the steam generated by the boiler increasing its thermal energy and decreasing the likelihood that it will condense inside the engine superheaters increase the thermal efficiency of the steam engine and have been widely adopted steam which has been superheated is logically known as superheated steam non superheated steam is called saturated steam or wet steam superheaters were applied to steam locomotives in quantity from the early 20th century to most steam vehicles and to stationary steam engines this equipment is still used in conjunction with steam turbines in electrical power generating stations throughout the world in steam locomotive use by far the most common form of superheater is the fire tube type this takes the saturated steam supplied in the dry pipe into a superheater header mounted against the tube sheet in the smokebox the steam is then

it is the top component of lithosphere a division of earth s layers that includes the crust and the upper part of the mantle the lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move allowing heat to escape from the interior of the earth into space the crust lies on top of the mantle a configuration that is stable because the upper mantle is made of peridotite and so is significantly denser than the crust the boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the mohorovi i discontinuity a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity the crust of the earth is of two distinctive types because both continental and oceanic crust are less dense than the mantle below both types of crust float on the mantle this is isostasy and it s also one of the reasons continental crust is higher than oceanic continental is less dense and so floats higher as a result water pools in above the oceanic crust forming the oceans the temperature of the crust increases with depth reaching values typically in the range from about to at the boundary with the underlying mantle the temperature increases by as much as for every

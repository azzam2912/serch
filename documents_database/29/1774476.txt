this is due to the variety of its territory and ecosystems that occur from sea level up to more than 4 000 meters above sea level ecological niches include but are not limited to subtropical and tropical rain forests wetlands dry forests scrublands cloud forests pine fir forests in the highlands despite this wealth however our knowledge on the mycobiota of the country is very poor there are several reasons for this primarily the prolonged guatemalan civil war 1960 1996 and related political and social instability that have severely hampered field work in the country the lack of trained local mycologists has certainly also delayed the detailed investigation of the rich mycota inhabiting the highly diversified guatemalan biotopes larger fungi usually referred to as macrofungi or macromycetes are of particular interest because of their importance as food resources and as a component of traditional culture in many places in the world moreover many basidiomycetes and ascomycetes with conspicuous sporocarps often play an important role as ectomycorrhizal mycobionts of trees and shrubs of boreal forests in the northern hemisphere and are important elements in many areas of the southern hemisphere although guatemalan macrofungi have not been as yet extensively surveyed a

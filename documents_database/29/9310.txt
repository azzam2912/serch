the specific nuclear reaction may be the fission of heavy isotopes e g uranium 235 u the nuclear chain reaction releases several million times more energy per reaction than any chemical reaction chemical chain reactions were first proposed by german chemist max bodenstein in 1913 and were reasonably well understood before nuclear chain reactions were proposed it was understood that chemical chain reactions were responsible for exponentially increasing rates in reactions such as produced in chemical explosions the concept of a nuclear chain reaction was reportedly first hypothesized by hungarian scientist le szil rd on september 12 1933 szil rd that morning had been reading in a london paper of an experiment in which protons from an accelerator had been used to split lithium 7 into alpha particles and the fact that much greater amounts of energy were produced by the reaction than the proton supplied ernest rutherford commented in the article that inefficiencies in the process precluded use of it for power generation however the neutron had been discovered in 1932 shortly before as the product of a nuclear reaction szil rd who had been trained as an engineer and physicist put the two nuclear experimental results together in

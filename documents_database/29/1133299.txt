emp3 is a member of the peripheral myelin protein gene family 22 kda pmp22 which is mainly responsible for the formation of the sheath of compact myelin although the detailed functions and mechanisms of emp3 still remain unclear it is suggested that emp3 is possibly epigenetically linked to certain carcinomas emp3 is a protein composed of a 163 amino acid sequence which is expressed from its gene located on the band of the 19q13 3 in the homo sapiens chromosome emp3 has the highest expression in the peripheral blood leukocytes compared to the expression in other body tissues the protein is characterized by 4 transmembrane domains and two n linked glycosylation sites in the first extracellular loop emp3 is a transmembrane protein which participates in cell to cell interaction and cell proliferation overexpression and silencing of emp3 both interrupt the normal expression of the emp3 gene which induces the progression and formation of cancers based on these properties of emp3 and the prognostic analyses on several types of tumors and cancers emp3 has a tumor suppressor like role in regulating differentiation apoptosis and development of cancer cells however the detailed mechanism still needs to be investigated the detailed functions as

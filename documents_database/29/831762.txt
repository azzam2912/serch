the existence of hybrids between b integrifolia and related species as well as early attempts to classify the species based on dried specimen material have also contributed to the confusion the species is divided into three subspecies b i subsp compar b i subsp integrifolia and b i subsp monticola recent molecular studies support this division until recently b integrifolia s taxonomic placement within the genus was largely settled with the species placed in banksia subg banksia sect banksia ser salicinae dna analyses have now cast doubt upon this arrangement and the publication of a new arrangement based on phylogenetic considerations has been foreshadowed banksia integrifolia commonly known as the coast banksia is one of the most widely distributed banksia species it occurs between victoria and central queensland in a broad range of habitats from coastal dunes to mountains it is highly variable in form but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres 82 ft in height its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides a contrast that can be striking on windy days a hardy and versatile australian native plant b integrifolia is widely planted in domestic gardens within its natural distribution it

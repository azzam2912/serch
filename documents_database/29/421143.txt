from cpan poe the perl object environment can be thought of as a tiny modular operating system one or more poe programs or instances can be run concurrently and are generally well suited for cooperative multitasking the poe package consists of namespaces and abstractions that guide future development of poe in an open ended cpan style convention the informal architecture consists of a set of layers with a kernel on the bottom this tiny kernel represents the events layer which operates as the main loop of each running poe instance the first call is to the event dispatcher poe kernel the poe kernel namespace contains a suite of functions which are plugged into the kernel itself these loop abstractions are designed after poe s standardized event loop bridge interface poe loop these can be mixed and matched as needed to provide runtime services and a lean facility for interprocess communication the basic functions are poe loop event poe loop poll and poe loop select also available are poe loop tk and poe loop gtk which offer hooks into other loop bridges in the external environment if that isn t enough the poe loop kernel abstraction provides reusable signal callbacks time

his new and robust designs allowed the timetables to be accelerated and it soon became clear that faster passenger locomotives with a large of power to weight ratio were needed this was especially true when the lswr s passenger requirements were increasing with lengthened heavier rolling stock that needed to keep up with faster point to point schedules however drummond knew that this could only be achieved via the use of the 4 6 0 wheel arrangement and a multiple cylinder layout he had already introduced the f13 e14 g14 and p14 as new classes of 4 6 0 but they had all fallen significantly short of keeping pace with the demands made of them despite his track record drummond decided to return to the 4 6 0 wheel arrangement this was because such a design had been proven on other railways such as the great central and the additional traction provided by an extra pair of driving wheels was useful in starting heavy trains the resultant design class t14 incorporated many features seen previously on his other 4 6 0 designs the drummond lipped chimney large splashers however driving wheel diameter was increased by seven inches to 6 7

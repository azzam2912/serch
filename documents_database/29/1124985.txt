they are also present in centrioles and basal bodies they are polymeric in nature and form filaments they include tekt1 tekt2 tekt3 tekt4 tekt5 tektin filaments are 2 to 3 nm diameter with two alpha helical segments they have the consensus amino acid sequence of rpnvelcrd different types of tektins designated as a 53 kda b 51 kda c 47 kda form dimers trimers and oligomers in various combinations and are also associated with tubulin in the microtubule tektins a and b form heteropolymeric protofilaments whereas tektin c forms homodimers tektin filaments are present in a supercoiled state this structure of tektins suggests that they are evolutionarily related to intermediate filaments the proteins are predicted to form extended rods composed of 2 alpha helical segments 180 residues long capable of forming coiled coils interrupted by non helical linkers the 2 segments are similar in sequence indicating a gene duplication event along each tektin rod cysteine residues occur with a periodicity of 8 nm coincident with the axial repeat of tubulin dimers in microtubules it is proposed that the assembly of tektin heteropolymers produces filaments with repeats of 8 16 24 32 40 48 and 96 nm generating the basis for

construction of such charts was initiated in the early 20th century and is still ongoing it is commonly believed that the periodic law represented by the periodic chart is echoed in the behavior of molecules at least small molecules for instance if one replaces any one of the atoms in a triatomic molecule with a rare gas atom there will be a drastic change in the molecule s properties several goals could be accomplished by constructing an explicit representation of this periodic law as manifested in molecules 1 a classification scheme for the vast number of molecules that exist starting with small ones having just a few atoms for use as a teaching aid and tool for archiving data 2 forecasting data for molecular properties based on the classification scheme and 3 a sort of unity with the periodic chart and the periodic system of fundamental particles periodic systems or charts or tables of molecules are the subjects of two reviews the systems of diatomic molecules include those of 1 h d w clark and 2 f a kong which somewhat resemble the atomic chart the system of r hefferlin et al was developed from 3 a three dimensional to

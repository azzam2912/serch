the mutational clusters are usually several hundred basepairs long alternating between a long range of c t substitutional pattern and a long range of g a substitutional pattern this suggests that kataegis is carried out on only one of the two template strands of dna during replication compared to other cancer related mutations such as chromothripsis kataegis is more commonly seen it is not an accumulative process but likely happens during one cycle of replication the term kataegis is derived from the ancient greek word for thunderstorm it was first used by scientists at the wellcome trust sanger institute to describe their observations of breast cancer cells in the process of mapping mutation clusters across the genome they used a visualization tool called rainfall plots as shown on the picture on the right with which they observed a clustering pattern for kataegis regions of kataegis have been shown to be colocalised with regions of somatic genome rearrangements in these regions known as the breakpoints basepairs are more prone to get deleted substituted or translocated most hypotheses of the kataegis involves errors during the frequent dna repair at the breakpoints a collection of enzymes from the dna repair system will come

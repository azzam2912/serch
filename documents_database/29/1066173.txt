this can be achieved by direct intervention of the utility in real time by the use of frequency sensitive relays triggering the circuit breakers ripple control by time clocks or by using special tariffs to influence consumer behavior load management allows utilities to reduce demand for electricity during peak usage times peak shaving which can in turn reduce costs by eliminating the need for peaking power plants in addition some peaking power plants can take more than an hour to bring on line which makes load management even more critical should a plant go off line unexpectedly for example load management can also help reduce harmful emissions since peaking plants or backup generators are often dirtier and less efficient than base load power plants new load management technologies are constantly under development both by private industry and public entities modern utility load management began about 1938 using ripple control by 1948 ripple control was a practical system in wide use the czechs first used ripple control in the 1950s early transmitters were low power compared to modern systems only 50 kilovolt amps they were rotating generators that fed a 1050hz signal into transformers attached to power distribution networks early receivers

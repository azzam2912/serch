it is a very simple tool that consists of a punch die and screw there are three different drive systems manual ratchet and hydraulic first a pilot hole is drilled slightly larger than the screw of the knockout punch then the die is placed on the screw and the screw is inserted into the pilot hole the screw is then threaded into the punch and the screw tightened until the punch is drawn completely through the sheet metal the manual system uses a screw that has a standard hex head or square head and is driven using an allen key or wrench a manual knockout punch can handle holes from the ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier this type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220 1 and can punch holes up to in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel a hydraulic system is much bulkier and heavier than the other systems but it is the easiest to use and can make holes up to in diameter it is a two piece system where the dies are attached to the ram which is connected to

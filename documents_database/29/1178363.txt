an extension to camberwell was due to be built in the late 1940s but the project was cancelled in the 21st century the project has been revived in one version or another with plans for an extension to be completed by 2028 or 2029 there has been a more concrete proposal which is to extend to lewisham camberwell was originally proposed as a short range destination for a southern extension of the bakerloo line but it is now widely viewed that the extension will continue below ground to lewisham station and then above ground via catford bridge railway station to take over the hayes line most of the london underground is north of the river thames with public transport in south london generally provided by national rail suburban networks and london buses both camberwell and neighbouring walworth once had their own railway stations camberwell and on the london chatham and dover railway into blackfriars the present day thameslink route but these stations closed in 1916 as a result this area of south london has no immediate rail or tube links the nearest stations are and before the baker street and waterloo railway now the bakerloo line opened between baker street

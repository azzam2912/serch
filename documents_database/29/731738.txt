this design proved impracticable and a smaller derivative the 2rs was proposed which would achieve intercontinental range by being air launched from a modified tupolev tu 95 bomber this too was unsuccessful with the aircraft unable to return to base if used on an intercontinental mission while being incapable of carrying a thermonuclear bomb the design was therefore revised again to a reconnaissance aircraft capable of operating from conventional runways the rsr as ramjets could not be used for take off they were replaced by turbofans the rsr was primarily of aluminium construction with a long circular section fuselage which housed a pressurized cabin for the pilot together with cameras and fuel with thin low aspect ratio trapezoidal wings the engines two soloviev d 21 turbofans were mounted at the tips of the wings the aircraft had a bicycle undercarriage with outriggers under the engine nacelles it was planned to cruise at greater than mach 2 at a height of 20 000 m 65 600 ft giving a range of a simplified full sized aerodynamic prototype for the novel layout the nm 1 was built in 1957 intended for low speed handling tests the nm 1 had a steel tube

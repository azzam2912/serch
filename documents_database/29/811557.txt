thus an object that exists in time has temporal parts in the various subregions of the total region of time it occupies just like an object that exists in a region of space has at least one part in every subregion of that space four dimensionalists typically argue for treating time as analogous to space usually leading them to endorse the doctrine of eternalism this is a philosophical approach to the ontological nature of time according to which all points in time are equally real as opposed to the presentist idea that only the present is real as some eternalists argue by analogy just as all spatially distant objects and events are equally as real as those close to us temporally distant objects and events are as real as those currently present to us perdurantism or perdurance theory is a closely related philosophical theory of persistence and identity according to which an individual has distinct temporal parts throughout its existence and the persisting object is the sum or set of all of its temporal parts this sum or set is colloquially referred to as a space time worm which has earned the perdurantist view the moniker of the worm view

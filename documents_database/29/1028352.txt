they are distinguished by their silver grey pelage long vibrissae rootless hypsodont molars and angular skull shape like many mammals of the eurasian steppe eco region they are well adapted to life in high altitudes and can be found in mountain areas of central and north asia from the chukchi peninsula in the north east to kugitang range in the west and to tibet and the himalayas in the south the phylogeny and life history of the central asian voles within the genus alticola are not well understood there are three subgenera of alticola alticola s str containing the silver mountain vole aschizomys and platycranius through a genetic analysis of the cytochrome c gene subgenera alticolas str and platycranius have been found to form in a monophyletic clade and have genetic differences with the asian vole subgenera aschisomys with splitting of these subgenera occurring in the late pleistocene the silvery mountain vole displays a broad spectrum of color variation from a bright yellow to a dark brown color differences are thought to be correlated with a dryness gradient throughout the region and not altitude this species tail length varies considerably in individuals from 32 to 51 of its body mass

such gradual variation can be used to produce lenses with flat surfaces or lenses that do not have the aberrations typical of traditional spherical lenses gradient index lenses may have a refraction gradient that is spherical axial or radial the lens of the eye is the most obvious example of gradient index optics in nature in the human eye the refractive index of the lens varies from approximately 1 406 in the central layers down to 1 386 in less dense layers of the lens this allows the eye to image with good resolution and low aberration at both short and long distances another example of gradient index optics in nature is the common mirage of a pool of water appearing on a road on a hot day the pool is actually an image of the sky apparently located on the road since light rays are being refracted bent from their normal straight path this is due to the variation of refractive index between the hot less dense air at the surface of the road and the denser cool air above it the variation in temperature and thus density of the air causes a gradient in its refractive index causing

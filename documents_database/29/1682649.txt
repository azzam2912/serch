it gives the asymptotic tail distribution of a random variable x when the true distribution f of x is unknown unlike for the first theorem the fisher tippett gnedenko theorem in extreme value theory the interest here is in the values above a threshold if we consider an unknown distribution function formula 1 of a random variable formula 2 we are interested in estimating the conditional distribution function formula 3 of the variable formula 2 above a certain threshold formula 5 this is the so called conditional excess distribution function defined as for formula 7 where formula 8 is either the finite or infinite right endpoint of the underlying distribution formula 1 the function formula 3 describes the distribution of the excess value over a threshold formula 5 given that the threshold is exceeded let formula 12 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables and let formula 3 be their conditional excess distribution function pickands 1975 balkema and de haan 1974 posed that for a large class of underlying distribution functions formula 1 and large formula 5 formula 3 is well approximated by the generalized pareto distribution that is where here 0 and y 0 when k

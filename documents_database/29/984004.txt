the main goal is to create a silicon oxide insulating structure that penetrates under the surface of the wafer so that the si sio interface occurs at a lower point than the rest of the silicon surface this cannot be easily achieved by etching field oxide thermal oxidation of selected regions surrounding transistors is used instead the oxygen penetrates in depth of the wafer reacts with silicon and transforms it into silicon oxide in this way an immersed structure is formed for process design and analysis purposes the oxidation of silicon surfaces can be modeled effectively using the deal grove model typical process steps are the following i preparation of silicon substrate layer 1 ii cvd of sio pad buffer oxide layer 2 iii cvd of sin nitride mask layer 3 iv etching of nitride layer layer 3 and silicon oxide layer layer 2 v thermal growth of silicon oxide structure 4 vi further growth of thermal silicon oxide structure 4 vii removal of nitride mask layer 3 there are 4 basic layers structures 1 the silicon wafer layer 1 is used as a basis for building electronic structures such as mos transistors to perform local oxidation the areas not

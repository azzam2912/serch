drawing upon her experience as a scholar and longtime organizer in the student environmental and labor movements mcalevey examines cases from labor unions and social movements to pinpoint the factors that helped them succeed or fail to accomplish their intended goals she argues that meaningful change can only happen with organizing that puts ordinary people at the center of their own struggle there are no shortcuts to lasting social change she also provides an analysis of power for movements and unions that often don t understand their own sources of power or how to use it effectively mcalevey writes that progressives in the united states lose on so many issues because of a crisis of the progressive movement which is so evident that nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of its basic assumptions is required mcalevey makes the case that the great social movements of previous eras gained their power from mass organizing a strategy today s progressives have mostly abandoned in favor of shallow mobilization or advocacy she concludes that in order to win progressive movements need strong unions built from bottom up organizing strategies that place the power for change in the hands of workers and ordinary people

catadioptric combinations are used in focusing systems such as searchlights headlamps early lighthouse focusing systems optical telescopes microscopes and telephoto lenses other optical systems that use lenses and mirrors are also referred to as catadioptric such as surveillance catadioptric sensors catadioptric combinations have been used for many early optical systems in the 1820s augustin jean fresnel developed several catadioptric lighthouse reflectors l on foucault developed a catadioptric microscope in 1859 to counteract aberrations of using a lens to image objects at high power in 1876 a french engineer a mangin invented what has come to be called the mangin mirror a concave glass reflector with the silver surface on the rear side of the glass the two surfaces of the reflector have different radii to correct the aberration of the spherical mirror light passes through the glass twice making the overall system act like a triplet lens mangin mirrors were used in searchlights where they produced a nearly true parallel beam many catadioptric telescopes use negative lenses with a reflective coating on the backside that are referred to as mangin mirrors although they are not single element objectives like the original mangin and some even predate the mangin s invention

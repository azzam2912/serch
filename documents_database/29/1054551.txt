this format allows it to be placed on the circuit board using the same automated equipment used to place other resistors instead of requiring a separate machine to install a jumper or other wire zero ohm resistors may be packaged like cylindrical resistors or like surface mount resistors one use is to allow traces on the same side of a pcb to cross one trace has a zero ohm resistor while the second trace runs in between the leads of the resistor avoiding contact with the first trace the resistance is only approximately zero only a maximum typically 10 50 m is specified a percentage tolerance would not make sense as it would be specified as a percentage of the ideal value of zero ohms which would always be zero so it is not specified an axial lead through hole zero ohm resistor is generally marked with a single black band the symbol for 0 in the resistor color code surface mount resistors are generally marked with a single 0 or 000 in practice zero ohm resistors can be useful as configuration jumpers but caution is exercised for pcb designs which may use zero ohm resistors to select between options

the genus name tringa is the new latin name given to the green sandpiper by aldrovandus in 1599 based on ancient greek trungas a thrush sized white rumped tail bobbing wading bird mentioned by aristotle they are mainly freshwater birds often with brightly coloured legs as reflected in the english names of six species as well as the specific names of two of these and the green sandpiper they are typically associated with northern hemisphere temperate regions for breeding some of this group notably the green sandpiper nest in trees using the old nests of other birds usually thrushes the willet and the tattlers have been found to belong in tringa these genus changes were formally adopted by the american ornithologists union in 2006 the present genus in the old more limited sense was even further subdivided into tringa proper and totanus either as subgenera or as full genera the available dna sequence data suggests however that neither of these is monophyletic and that the latter simply lumps together a number of more of less closely related apomorphic species therefore it seems unwarranted to recognize totanus even as a subgenus for the time being these are listed in systematic sequence

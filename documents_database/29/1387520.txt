although amniotes especially mammals were thought to serve as hosts it has been recently suggested that these viruses might infect bacteria and possibly some other invertebrates there are currently only two species in this genus including the type species human picobirnavirus associated symptoms include gastroenteritis in animals and humans though the disease association is unclear first detection of picobirnavirus pbv was in humans and black footed pigmy rice rats in 1988 viral replication is cytoplasmic entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell replication follows the double stranded rna virus replication model double stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription mammals serve as the natural host transmission routes are fecal oral viruses in picobirnavirus are non enveloped with icosahedral geometries and t 3 symmetry the diameter is around 35 40 nm the genome is linear bipartite and composed of double stranded rna it includes a segment 1 2 5 2 2 2 7 kilobases kb length and a segment 2 1 7 1 2 1 9 kb in length the genome codes for 3 to 4 proteins the capsid protein gene is encoded by the second open reading frame of the larger genomic

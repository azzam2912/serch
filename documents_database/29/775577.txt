prior to 2009 he was florence pirce grant university professor of mechanics of solids and structures at brown university in providence rhode island needleman received his b s from the university of pennsylvania in 1966 an m s and ph d from harvard university in 1967 and 1970 respectively advised by john w hutchinson he was an instructor and assistant professor in the department of applied mathematics at the massachusetts institute of technology from 1970 to 1975 he was a professor of engineering at brown university starting in 1975 and served as the dean of the engineering department from 1988 to 1991 he was the chair of the applied mechanics division needleman s main research interests are in the computational modeling of deformation and fracture processes in structural materials in particular metals a general objective is to provide quantitative relations between the measurable and hopefully controllable features of the materials micro scale structure and its macroscopic mechanical behavior ongoing research projects involve studies of ductile fracture and ductile brittle transitions crack growth in heterogeneous microstructures with particular emphasis on the role of interfaces nonlocal and discrete dislocation plasticity fatigue crack growth and fast fracture in brittle solids needleman is a

this technique allows ground based telescopes to reach the maximum possible resolution allowing ground based telescopes with large diameters to produce far greater resolution than does the hubble space telescope the principal limitation of the technique is that it is applicable only to relatively bright astronomical objects a mask is placed over the telescope which only allows light through a small number of holes this array of holes acts as a miniature astronomical interferometer the method was developed by john e baldwin and collaborators in the cavendish astrophysics group in the aperture masking technique the bispectral analysis speckle masking method is typically applied to image data taken through masked apertures where most of the aperture is blocked off and light can only pass through a series of small holes subapertures the aperture mask removes atmospheric noise from these measurements allowing the bispectrum to be measured more quickly than for an un masked aperture for simplicity the aperture masks are usually either placed in front of the secondary mirror e g tuthill et al 2000 or placed in a re imaged aperture plane as shown in figure 1 a e g haniff et al 1987 young et al 2000 baldwin et

the housing was milled from a solid block of fiberglass or bakelite which may have been impregnated with asbestos for fire resistance with a screw on cover later connectors including those currently manufactured use molded plastic or machined phenolic resin laminate housings these two pin connectors were not polarized and thus the line and neutral conductors could be exchanged depending on which way the connectors were mated two pin connectors may still be found on some equipment and are often saved by electricians for wiring ungrounded fixtures particularly practicals though this may not be advisable from a safety standpoint modern stage pin connectors have incorporated a third pin for a safety ground connection and are commonly referred to as two pin and ground 2p g to distinguish them from their ungrounded two pin predecessors the ground pin is situated between the line and neutral pins and closer to the latter for 20 a connectors this asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and neutral conductors are not exchanged in a properly wired installation the ground pin is also longer than the other two ensuring that the safety ground connection is made first when making a connection all

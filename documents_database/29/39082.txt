it was invented by chris langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells the universality of langton s ant was proven in 2000 the idea has been generalized in several different ways such as turmites which add more colors and more states squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white we arbitrarily identify one square as the ant the ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes the ant moves according to the rules below langton s ant can also be described as a cellular automaton where the grid is colored black or white and the ant square has one of eight different colors assigned to encode the combination of black white state and the current direction of motion of the ant these simple rules lead to complex behavior three distinct modes of behavior are apparent when starting on a completely white grid all finite initial configurations tested eventually converge to the same repetitive pattern suggesting that the highway is an attractor of langton s ant but no one has been able to prove that this is true for all such initial configurations it

a chandrasekhar the film features sarathkumar and abhirami in lead roles whilst raghuvaran prakash raj and indu play supporting roles the film has received to mixed reviews vishwa sarathkumar and raghu raghuvaran are the closest of friends of course the former is true while the latter is merely a mercenary nothing matters to raghu except money he uses his rich friend as a ruse to rise in status devoted to his selfish friend vishwa is too naive to know that raghu is a scheming archetypal villain who could ruin him for money when he does realize the truth it is too late he is already a wreck estranged from his child and lover and behind bars now it is time for revenge lyrics written by vaali bbthots called a fairly engaging thriller but chandrasekar s contribution is minimal since the movie is a frame by frame copy of the hollywood hit double jeopardy with sarathkumar taking on the role played by ashley judd the hindu wrote the film has flashes of intelligence splashes of humour spurts of sentiment and mounds of melodrama yet the cocktail does not offer complete satiety one reason could be the pace affected as it is

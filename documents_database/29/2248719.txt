with these we have the sum on the right is finite since numbers formula 12 have for instance formula 13 prime factors the identities prove that one may compute formula 15 by computing formula 16 and formula 17 formula 18 and this is what the meissel lehmer algorithm does for formula 19 we get the following formula for formula 20 for formula 22 there is a similar expansion using the formula formula 24 may be expanded each summand in turn may be expanded in the same way so that a very large alternating sum arises the only thing that remains to be done is evaluating formula 16 and formula 26 for certain values of formula 27 and formula 4 this can be done by direct sieving and using the above formulas jeffrey lagarias victor miller and andrew odlyzko published a realisation of this algorithm which computes formula 15 in time formula 30 and space formula 31 for any formula 32 upon setting formula 33 the tree of formula 16 has formula 35 leaf nodes

today in the visual system the left visual field is represented in the right hemisphere and the right visual field in the left hemisphere furthermore the visual fields are represented upside down in the brain the physical cause is only the change from a convex eye that is turned to the environment like an insect eye to a retracted concave retina figure 1 and 2 in addition the right hemisphere controls the left part of the body and the left hemisphere controls the right part of the body these circumstances are caused by evolution protection of the retina and maintenance of motor control and self defense after injury on the injured side of the body during eye evolution there existed an additional convex stadium of the retina figure 1 left presumably which explains why today the left visual field is represented in the right hemisphere and vice versa with the change from convex to concave retinas the visual input changed sides on the retina and was represented upside down in addition evolutionary stages are sometimes conserved in developmental stages which serve as a proof for stages during evolution the convex stadium is also mirrored in the embryonal development in the

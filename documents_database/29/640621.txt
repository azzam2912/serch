gyroscopes of this type can be extremely accurate and stable for example those used in the gravity probe b experiment measured changes in gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than 0 5 milliarcseconds 1 4 degrees over a one year period this is equivalent to an angular separation the width of a human hair viewed from 32 kilometers 20 miles away the gp b gyro consists of a nearly perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz which provides a dielectric support for a thin layer of niobium superconducting material to eliminate friction found in conventional bearings the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes after the initial spin up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4 000 rpm the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor provided the suspension electronics remain powered the extreme rotational symmetry lack of friction and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15 000 years a sensitive dc squid magnetometer able to discriminate changes as small as one quantum or about 2 wb is used to monitor

the basic idea behind mec is that by running applications and performing related processing tasks closer to the cellular customer network congestion is reduced and applications perform better mec technology is designed to be implemented at the cellular base stations or other edge nodes and enables flexible and rapid deployment of new applications and services for customers combining elements of information technology and telecommunications networking mec also allows cellular operators to open their radio access network ran to authorized third parties such as application developers and content providers technical standards for mec are being developed by the european telecommunications standards institute which has produced a technical white paper about the concept mec provides a distributed computing environment for application and service hosting it also has the ability to store and process content in close proximity to cellular subscribers for faster response time applications can also be exposed to real time radio access network ran information the key element is the mec application server which is integrated at the ran element this server provides computing resources storage capacity connectivity and access to ran information it supports a multitenancy run time and hosting environment for applications the virtual appliance applications are delivered

three major classes of mats sert dat net are responsible for the reuptake of their associated amine neurotransmitters serotonin dopamine norepinephrine mats are located just outside the synaptic cleft peri synaptically transporting monoamine transmitter overflow from the synaptic cleft back to the cytoplasm of the pre synaptic neuron mat regulation generally occurs through phosphorylation and posttranslational modification due to their significance in neuronal signaling mats are commonly associated with drugs used to treat mental disorders as well as recreational drugs a line that can become quite blurred in many cases compounds targeting mats range from medications such as the wide variety of tricyclic antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine prozac to stimulant medications such as methylphenidate ritalin and amphetamine in its many forms adderall dexedrine and derivatives methamphetamine desoxyn and lisdexamfetamine vyvanse furthermore drugs such as mdma ecstasy molly and natural alkaloids such as cocaine exert their effects in part by their interaction with mats by blocking the transporters from mopping up dopamine serotonin and other neurotransmitters from the synapse there are several different monoamine transporters located along the plasma membrane each belonging to the family of na cl dependent substrate specific neuronal membrane transporters dat is responsible

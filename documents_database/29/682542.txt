it is a grey solid although commercial samples are often dark or even black it is used as a rodenticide znp is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1 5 ev and may have applications in photovoltaic cells a second zinc phosphide is known with the stoichiometry znp zinc phosphide can be prepared by the reaction of zinc with phosphorus however for critical applications additional processing to remove arsenic compounds may be needed another method of preparation include reacting tri n octylphosphine with dimethylzinc zinc phosphide reacts with water to produce phosphine ph and zinc hydroxide zn oh znp has a room temperature tetragonal form that converts to a cubic form at around 845 c in the room temperature form there are discrete p atoms zinc atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated and phosphorus six coordinate with zinc atoms at 6 of the vertices of a distorted cube znp also has two forms a lower temperature red tetragonal form and a black monoclinic form in both of these there are chains of p atoms helical in the tetragonal semi spiral in the monoclinic zinc phosphide is an ideal candidate for thin film photovoltaic applications for it has strong optical absorption

such frequencies are known as the system s antiresonant frequencies and at these frequencies the oscillation amplitude can drop to almost zero antiresonances are caused by destructive interference for example between an external driving force and interaction with another oscillator antiresonances can occur in all types of coupled oscillator systems including mechanical acoustic electromagnetic and quantum systems they have important applications in the characterization of complex coupled systems the simplest system in which antiresonance arises is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators for example pendula or rlc circuits consider two harmonic oscillators coupled together with strength formula 1 and with one oscillator driven by an oscillating external force formula 2 the situation is described by the coupled ordinary differential equations where the formula 4 represent the resonance frequencies of the two oscillators and the formula 5 their damping rates changing variables to the complex parameters formula 6 formula 7 allows us to write these as first order equations we transform to a frame rotating at the driving frequency formula 9 yielding where we have introduced the detunings formula 11 between the drive and the oscillators resonance frequencies finally we make a rotating wave approximation neglecting the fast counter rotating terms

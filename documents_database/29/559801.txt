in optics research these can be quite sophisticated devices due to the need to be able to tip and tilt the mirror by controlled amounts while still holding it in a precise position when it is not being adjusted an optical mirror mount generally consists of a movable front plate which holds the mirror and a fixed back plate with adjustment screws adjustment screws drive the front plate about the axes of rotation in the pitch vertical and yaw horizontal directions an optional third actuator often enables z axis translation precision mirror mounts can be quite expensive and a notable amount of engineering goes into their design such sophisticated mounts are often required for lasers interferometers and optical delay lines the most common type of mirror mount is the kinematic mount this type of mount is designed according to the principles of kinematic determinacy typically the movable frame that holds the mirror pivots on a ball bearing which is set into a hole in the fixed frame ideally this hole should be trihedral pyramid shaped often a conical hole is used due to easier manufacture the frame is pivoted by means of two micrometers or fine thread screws tipped with

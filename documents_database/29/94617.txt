understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behaviour understanding is often though not always related to learning concepts and sometimes also the theory or theories associated with those concepts however a person may have a good ability to predict the behaviour of an object animal or system and therefore may in some sense understand it without necessarily being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with that object animal or system in their culture they may have developed their own distinct concepts and theories which may be equivalent better or worse than the recognised standard concepts and theories of their culture thus understanding is correlated with the ability to make inferences someone who has a more sophisticated understanding more predictively accurate understanding and or an understanding that allows them to make explanations that others commonly judge to be better of something is said to understand that thing deeply conversely someone who has a more limited understanding of a thing is said to have a shallow understanding however the depth of understanding required to usefully participate in an occupation or activity may vary greatly for example consider multiplication of integers

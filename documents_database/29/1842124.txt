the lifting capacity of the offshore crane can be increased significantly during lifting in high sea states if a shock absorber is fitted offshore lifting capacity is governed by classification society rules the fundamental rule is that the design load should not be exceeded the design load is given by formula 1 where formula 2 crane design load formula 3 dynamic coefficient formula 4 safe working load formula 5 acceleration of gravity the classification societies require that formula 6 1 3 for offshore cranes this means that formula 4 cannot exceed formula 8 even for platform lifts to calculate the dynamic load the classification societies use energy equations the kinetic energy of the load is expressed as formula 9 where formula 10 kinetic energy of the load formula 11 relative velocity between crane hook and load energy absorbed by the crane is given by formula 12 where formula 13 spring energy stored in crane structure formula 14 stiffness of offshore crane formula 15 vertical displacement of crane hook the pring force is given by formula 16 combining the two previous equations yields an alternative description of the energy stored in the crane structure formula 17 during an offshore lift the

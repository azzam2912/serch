this complex has been proven to be essential for the generation of the respiratory rhythm in mammals the exact mechanism of the rhythm generation and transmission to motor nuclei remains controversial and the topic of much research several synthetic compounds have been shown to act on neurons specific to the preb tc most being selective agonists or antagonists to receptor subtypes on neurons in the vicinity since many of these neurons express gaba glutamate serotonin and adenosine receptors chemicals custom tailored to bind at these sites are most effective at altering respiratory rhythm adenosine modulates the preb tc output via activation of the a and a receptor subtypes an adenosine a receptor agonist has been shown to depress preb tc rhythmogenesis independent of the neurotransmitters gaba and glycine in in vitro preparations from 0 7 day old mice another synthetic drug specific to the adenosine a receptor subtype is cgs 21680 that has been shown to cause apneas in 14 to 21 day old rat pups in vivo for this reason it has been used as a model to study pathological conditions such as apnea of prematurity and sudden infant death syndrome the region is named after the silvaner boetzinger

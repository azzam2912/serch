it was discovered in 2015 the virus was identified from the mosquito aedes vigilax collected from sydney under the joint research project by scientists at the university of queensland and the university of sydney in experimental infections the virus is unable to grow in vertebrate cells but only in aedes derived mosquito cell lines this suggests that the virus does not infect vertebrates the name is given because it was discovered from silverwater a suburb of sydney on the southern bank of the parramatta river the mosquitoes from which the virus was isolated were actually collected in 2007 and had been preserved since then the study commenced only after the development of the technique of viral detection in mosquitoes in the university of queensland the virus was identified as a result of investigation on the outbreak of ross river virus in 2015 both the viruses are transmitted by the same mosquitoes but parv is not transmitted to humans unlike rrv according to one of the co authors cameron webb of the university of sydney this unique transmission of parv could hold a key to vaccinate mosquitoes and stop their bites making thousands of australians sick every summer the reason explained

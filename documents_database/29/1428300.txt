the inside of the thylakoid membrane is called the lumen and outside the thylakoid membrane is the stroma where the light independent reactions take place the thylakoid membrane contains some integral membrane protein complexes that catalyze the light reactions there are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane photosystem ii psii cytochrome b6f complex photosystem i psi and atp synthase these four complexes work together to ultimately create the products atp and nadph the four photosystems absorb light energy through pigments primarily the chlorophylls which are responsible for the green color of leaves the light dependent reactions begin in photosystem ii when a chlorophyll a molecule within the reaction center of psii absorbs a photon an electron in this molecule attains a higher energy level because this state of an electron is very unstable the electron is transferred from one to another molecule creating a chain of redox reactions called an electron transport chain etc the electron flow goes from psii to cytochrome bf to psi in psi the electron gets the energy from another photon the final electron acceptor is nadp in oxygenic photosynthesis the first electron donor is water creating oxygen as a waste product in anoxygenic

the mixed mating model assumes that every fertilisation event may be classed as either self fertilisation or outcrossing with a completely random mate that is it assumes that inbreeding is caused solely by self fertilisation this assumption is often violated in wild plant populations where inbreeding may be due to outcrossing between closely related plants for example in dense stands mating often occurs between plants in close proximity and in plants with short seed dispersal distances plants are often closely related to their nearest neighbours when both these criteria are met plants will tend to be closely related to the near neighbours with which they mate resulting in significant inbreeding in such a scenario the mixed mating model will attribute all inbreeding to self fertilisation and therefore overestimate the extent of self fertilisation occurring the effective selfing model takes into account the potential for inbreeding to occur as a result of outcrossing between closely related plants by considering the extent of kinship between mates ultimately it is not possible to tease apart the two potential causes of inbreeding and attributed the observed inbreeding to one cause or the other therefore just as with the mixed mating model in the effective

they are parametrized by a real formula 2 or formula 3 both are defined with the mittag leffler function named after g sta mittag leffler for any complex formula 4 whose real part is positive the series defines an entire function for formula 6 the series converges only on a disc of radius one but it can be analytically extended to formula 7 the first family of mittag leffler distributions is defined by a relation between the mittag leffler function and their cumulative distribution functions for all formula 2 the function formula 9 is increasing on the real line converges to formula 10 in formula 11 and formula 12 hence the function formula 13 is the cumulative distribution function of a probability measure on the non negative real numbers the distribution thus defined and any of its multiples is called a mittag leffler distribution of order formula 4 all these probability distributions are absolutely continuous since formula 15 is the exponential function the mittag leffler distribution of order formula 16 is an exponential distribution however for formula 17 the mittag leffler distributions are heavy tailed their laplace transform is given by which implies that for formula 17 the expectation is

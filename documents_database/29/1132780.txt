the brief period of etruscan coinage with the predominance of marks of value seems to be an amalgam that reconciles two very different monetary systems the primitive bronze weighing and aes grave economy of central italy with that of struck silver and gold issues of southern italian greek type not familiar in etruria setting aside the early 5th century bc auriol type silver fractions of the volterra hoard of 1868 which are probably not of etruscan production the earliest struck silver coinage seems to be that of vulci and populonia an attribution to the 5th century for these first issues of tridrachms didrachms or staters and drachms is plausible since they seem to be struck on the chalcidian silver drachm standard of theoretically about 5 8 grams which were present at etruria s nearest greek neighbour i e cumae dated to about 475 470 bc and at other greek cities important to etruscan sea borne commerce in the early 5th century such as himera naxos and zancle the coins are of greek style but with an etruscan flavour and have a predilection for apotropaic images of exotic animals and monsters that drive away evil demons the wheels with curved struts

the processor is designed to offer high multithreaded performance 8 threads per core with 8 cores per chip as well as high single threaded performance from the same chip the chip is the 4th generation processor in the t series family sun microsystems brought the first t series processor ultrasparc t1 to market in 2005 the chip is the first sun oracle sparc chip to use dynamic threading and out of order execution it incorporates one floating point unit and one dedicated cryptographic unit per core the cores use the 64 bit sparc version 9 architecture running at frequencies between 2 85 ghz and 3 0 ghz and are built in a 40 nm process with a die size of an eight core eight thread per core chip built in a 40 nm process and running at 2 5 ghz was described in sun microsystems processor roadmap of 2009 it was codenamed yosemite falls and given an expected release date of late 2011 the processor was expected to introduce a new microarchitecture codenamed vt core the online technology website the register speculated that this chip would be named t4 being the successor to the sparc t3 the yosemite falls cpu

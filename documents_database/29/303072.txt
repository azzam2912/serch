early cadc systems were electromechanical computers such as in the f 111 from 1968 to 1970 the first digital cadc was developed for the f 14 following the success of the swedish ck37 in the aj37 in the 1980s the standard central air data computer was developed to retrofit u s air force and u s navy aircraft it was classified by the navy until 1998 meaning that intel s 4004 was widely regarded as the first ever microprocessor the f 14 cadc was a ground breaking integrated flight control system developed by garrett airesearch it was used in early versions of the us navy s f 14 tomcat fighter it is notable for its early use of airesearch s custom designed mos based lsi microprocessor chipset the mp944 the cadc was designed and built at garrett airesearch by a team led by steve geller and ray holt and supported by the startup american microsystems design work started in 1968 and was completed in june 1970 beating out a number of electromechanical systems that had also been designed for the f 14 ray holt s story of this design and development is presented in the book the accidental engineer the

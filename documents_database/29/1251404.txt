the first plans for a building named for hendrik hudson on riverside drive were announced in october 1897 by eugene kirby a former manager of the marie antoinette hotel this was to be an eighteen story hotel these plans were never completed however and by 1907 an apartment building bearing the name had been constructed instead in order to take advantage of the newly opened subway in the area developers george f johnson and aleck kahn purchased three quarters of the block defined by riverside drive broadway west 110th street and 111th street in order to build an apartment complex the architectural firm of rouse sloan was hired to design and construct the building the project was led by william l rouse and the result was an eight story building modeled after a tuscan villa containing 72 apartment units the building also featured two towers on the north and south sides connected by a promenade the apartments officially opened on october 1 1907 and the units were quickly rented due to this success a 12 story annex also designed by william rouse was constructed the apartment building continued to enjoy success for several decades until the aftermath of the 1943

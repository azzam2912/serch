it is an important concept in such fields as astronomy and astrophysics the distance from a body s center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a two body problem if one of two orbiting bodies is much more massive than the other and the bodies are relatively close to one another the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object in this case rather than the two bodies appearing to orbit a point between them the less massive body will appear to orbit about the more massive body while the more massive body might be observed to wobble slightly this is the case for the earth moon system in which the barycenter is located on average from earth s center 75 of earth s radius of when the two bodies are of similar masses the barycenter will generally be located between them and both bodies will orbit around it this is the case for pluto and charon one of pluto s natural satellites as well as for many binary asteroids and binary stars when the less massive object is far away the barycenter can be located outside the more massive object this is the case

the growth of cellular telephone in the 1980s attracted interest in commercial applications the upgrade to digital radio technology in the mobile phone indoor wireless network and satellite broadcasting industries created new opportunities for smart antennas in the 1990s culminating in the development of the mimo multiple input multiple output technology used in 4g wireless networks the earliest success at tracking and controlling wireless signals relied on the antennas physical configuration and motion the german inventor and physicist karl f braun demonstrated beamforming for the first time in 1905 braun created a phased array by positioning three antennas to reinforce radiation in one direction and diminish radiation in other directions guglielmo marconi experimented with directional antennas in 1906 directional antennas were rotated to detect and track enemy forces during world war i the british admiralty used goniometers radio compasses to track the german fleet edwin h armstrong invented the superheterodyne receiver to detect the high frequency noise generated by german warplanes ignition systems the war ended before armstrong s creation was ready to help direct antiaircraft fire multiple elements a fed dipole a director and reflectors were assembled in the 1920s to create narrow transmit and receive antenna patterns the

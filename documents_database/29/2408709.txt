her research focuses on animal and human preclinical models for cancer pritchard received her ma in biochemistry from jesus college oxford university in 1983 in 1987 she finished her phd at the imperial cancer research fund on mapping of the male determining gene on the human y chromosome under the supervision of peter goodfellow pritchard undertook postdoctoral research at the university of california san francisco 1987 1991 and at the dnax research institute california 1992 1995 at dnax she worked on intracellular signalling through raf kinases investigating their mechanisms of control of the mapk pathway in normal and cancer cells pritchard moved to the university of leicester where she held a royal society university research fellow from 1995 2003 she began to use genetic mouse models to investigate the role of the raf family of protein kinases in control of intracellular signalling pathways involved in mammalian development she developed conditional knockin mouse models for oncogenic forms of braf detected in human cancer and used these models to understand mechanisms of oncogene driven cancer initiation and progression the majority of this work was supported by cancer research uk programme funding part of this research involved receptors that were linked to male

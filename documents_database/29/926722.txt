in more colloquial terms in a party of people some of whom shake hands an even number of people must have shaken an odd number of other people s hands the handshaking lemma is a consequence of the degree sum formula also sometimes called the handshaking lemma for a graph with vertex set v and edge set e both results were proven by in his famous paper on the seven bridges of k nigsberg that began the study of graph theory the vertices of odd degree in a graph are sometimes called odd nodes or odd vertices in this terminology the handshaking lemma can be restated as the statement that every graph has an even number of odd nodes proved euler s proof of the degree sum formula uses the technique of double counting he counts the number of incident pairs v e where e is an edge and vertex v is one of its endpoints in two different ways vertex v belongs to deg v pairs where deg v the degree of v is the number of edges incident to it therefore the number of incident pairs is the sum of the degrees however each edge in the graph

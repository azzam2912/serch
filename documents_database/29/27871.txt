as a normal form it is useful in automated theorem proving a logical formula is considered to be in dnf if and only if it is a disjunction of one or more conjunctions of one or more literals a dnf formula is in full disjunctive normal form if each of its variables appears exactly once in every conjunction as in conjunctive normal form cnf the only propositional operators in dnf are and or and not the not operator can only be used as part of a literal which means that it can only precede a propositional variable the following is a formal grammar for dnf where variable is any variable for example all of the following formulas are in dnf however the following formulas are not in dnf converting a formula to dnf involves using logical equivalences such as double negation elimination de morgan s laws and the distributive law all logical formulas can be converted into an equivalent disjunctive normal form however in some cases conversion to dnf can lead to an exponential explosion of the formula for example the dnf of a logical formula of the following form has 2 terms any particular boolean function can be represented

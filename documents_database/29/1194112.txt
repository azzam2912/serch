the small size of ume give them large diffusion layers and small overall currents these features allow ume to achieve useful steady state conditions and very high scan rates v s with limited distortion ume were developed independently by wightman and fleischmann around 1980 small current at ume enables electrochemical measurements in low conductive media organic solvents where voltage drop associated with high solution resistance makes these experiments difficult for conventional electrodes furthermore small voltage drop at ume leads to a very small voltage distortion at the electrode solution interface which allows using two electrode setup in voltammetric experiment instead of conventional three electrode setup ultramicroelectrodes are often defined as electrodes which are smaller than the diffusion layer achieved in a readily accessed experiment a working definition is an electrode that has at least one dimension the critical dimension smaller than 25 m platinum electrodes with a radius of 5 m are commercially available and electrodes with critical dimension of 0 1 m have been made electrodes with even smaller critical dimension have been reported in the literature but exist mostly as proofs of concept the most common ume is a disk shaped electrode created by embedding a thin wire

it is comparable in many respects to the european union s nessie project and to the advanced encryption standard process run by nist in the u s there is some overlap and some conflict between the nessie selections and the cryptrec draft recommendations both efforts include some of the best cryptographers in the world therefore conflicts in their selections and recommendations should be examined with care for instance cryptrec recommends several 64 bit block ciphers while nessie selected none but cryptrec was obliged by its terms of reference to take into account existing standards and practices while nessie was not similar differences in terms of reference account for cryptrec recommending at least one stream cipher rc4 while the nessie report specifically said that it was notable that they had not selected any of those considered rc4 is widely used in the ssl tls protocols nevertheless cryptrec recommended that it only be used with 128 bit keys essentially the same consideration led to cryptrec s inclusion of 160 bit message digest algorithms despite their suggestion that they be avoided in new system designs also cryptrec was unusually careful to examine variants and modifications of the techniques or at least to discuss

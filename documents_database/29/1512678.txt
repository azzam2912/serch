it is calculated using a quarter car vehicle math model whose response is accumulated to yield a roughness index with units of slope in mi m km etc since its introduction in 1986 iri has become the road roughness index most commonly used worldwide for evaluating and managing road systems the measurement of iri is required for data provided to the united states federal highway administration and is covered in several standards from astm international astm e1926 08 astm e1364 95 2005 and others iri is also used to evaluate new pavement construction to determine penalties or bonus payments based on smoothness in the early 1980s the highway engineering community identified road roughness as the primary indicator of the utility of a highway network to road users however existing methods used to characterize roughness were not reproducible by different agencies using different measuring equipment and methods even within a given agency the methods were not necessarily repeatable nor were they stable with time the united states national cooperative highway research program nchrp initiated a research project to help state agencies improve their use of roughness measuring equipment the work was continued by the world bank to determine how to compare

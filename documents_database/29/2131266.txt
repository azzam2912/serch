a eutriconodont it is known from the cedar mountain formation and is both a large sized and possibly ecologically specialised taxon showcasing the diversity of mammals in the mesozoic jugulator is known primarily from isolated teeth and dentaries the species is most distinctive in regards to its large size being among the largest mammals in the region some lower molars exceeding 5 mm in length and with an estimated body weight of about 750 g the medial lower incisor is greatly enlarged with a mitten shaped crown that bears sharp cutting surfaces always recognised as a triconodontid eutriconodont the most recent phylogenetic studies recover jugulator as the sister taxon of a clade comprising volaticotherium ichthyoconodon triconolestes and argentoconodon known as volaticotherini jugulator is noted as being a rather large mammal for mesozoic standards combined with the general adaptations for carnivory that eutriconodonts display it is safe to say that it was a predator of other vertebrates like mammals lizards and small dinosaurs other large eutriconodonts like repenomamus and gobiconodon show evidence of scavenging and direct predation on such creatures so it is likely that jugulator also displayed these behaviours jugulator occurs in the mid cretaceous deposits of the cedar mountain

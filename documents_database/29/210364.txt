it is similar to a group in many ways but need not be associative moufang loops were introduced by smooth moufang loops have an associated algebra the malcev algebra similar in some ways to how a lie group has an associated lie algebra a moufang loop is a loop q that satisfies the four following identities for all x y z in q the binary operation in q is denoted by juxtaposition these identities are known as moufang identities moufang loops differ from groups in that they need not be associative a moufang loop that is associative is a group the moufang identities may be viewed as weaker forms of associativity by setting various elements to the identity the moufang identities imply moufang s theorem states that when three elements x y and z in a moufang loop obey the associative law xy z x yz then they generate an associative subloop that is a group a corollary of this is that all moufang loops are di associative i e the subloop generated by any two elements of a moufang loop is associative and therefore a group in particular moufang loops are power associative so that exponents x are well

gnrh is a tropic peptide hormone synthesized and released from gnrh neurons within the hypothalamus the peptide belongs to gonadotropin releasing hormone family it constitutes the initial step in the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis the identity of gnrh was clarified by the 1977 nobel laureates roger guillemin and andrew v schally as is standard for peptide representation the sequence is given from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus also standard is omission of the designation of chirality with assumption that all amino acids are in their l form the abbreviations appearing are to standard proteinogenic amino acids except for pyroglu which refers to pyroglutamic acid a derivative of glutamic acid the nh2 at the carboxyl terminus indicates that rather than terminating as a free carboxylate it terminates as a carboxamide the gene gnrh1 for the gnrh precursor is located on chromosome 8 in mammals the linear decapeptide end product is synthesized from an 89 amino acid preprohormone in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus it is the target of various regulatory mechanisms of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis such as being inhibited by increased estrogen levels in the body gnrh is secreted in the hypophysial portal bloodstream at the median eminence the portal

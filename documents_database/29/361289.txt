typically the term datacube is applied in contexts where these arrays are massively larger than the hosting computer s main memory examples include multi terabyte petabyte data warehouses and time series of image data the data cube is used to represent data sometimes called facts along some measure of interest for example in olap such measures could be the subsidiaries a company has the products the company offers and time in this setup a fact would be a sales event where a particular product has been sold in a particular subsidiary at a particular time in satellite image timeseries measures would be latitude and longitude coordinates and time a fact would be a pixel at a given space time coordinate as taken by the satellite following some processing that is not of concern here even though it is called a cube and the examples provided above happen to be 3 dimensional for brevity a data cube generally is a multi dimensional concept which can be 1 dimensional 2 dimensional 3 dimensional or higher dimensional in any case every dimension represents a separate measure whereas the cells in the cube represent the facts of interest sometimes cubes hold only few values

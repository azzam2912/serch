like simcos and tutsim acsl is a dialect of the continuous system simulation language cssl originally designed by the simulation councils inc sci in 1967 in an attempt to unify the continuous simulations field acsl is an equation oriented language consisting of a set of arithmetic operators standard functions a set of special acsl statements and a macro capability which allows extension of the special acsl statements acsl is intended to provide a simple method of representing mathematical models on a digital computer working from an equation description of the problem or a block diagram the user writes acsl statements to describe the system under investigation an important feature of acsl is its sorting of the continuous model equations in contrast to general purpose programming languages such as fortran where program execution depends critically on statement order applications of acsl in new areas are being developed constantly typical areas in which acsl is currently applied include control system design aerospace simulation chemical process dynamics power plant dynamics plant and animal growth toxicology models vehicle handling microprocessor controllers and robotics the acslx family of products by aegis technologies group inc the modular modeling system mms by nhance technologies inc

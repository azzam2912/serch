epi convergence is important because it is the appropriate notion of convergence with which to approximate minimization problems in the field of mathematical optimization the symmetric notion of hypo convergence is appropriate for maximization problems mosco convergence is a generalization of epi convergence to infinite dimensional spaces let formula 1 be a metric space and formula 2 a real valued function for each natural number formula 3 we say that the sequence formula 4 epi converges to a function formula 5 if for each formula 6 the following extension allows epi convergence to be applied to a sequence of functions with non constant domain denote by formula 8 the extended real numbers let formula 9 be a function formula 10 for each formula 11 the sequence formula 12 epi converges to formula 13 if for each formula 6 epi convergence is the appropriate topology with which to approximate minimization problems for maximization problems one uses the symmetric notion of hypo convergence formula 12 hypo converges to formula 17 if and assume we have a difficult minimization problem where formula 21 and formula 22 we can attempt to approximate this problem by a sequence of easier problems for functions formula 24

few members of this gens are mentioned in history but a number are known from inscriptions the nomen safinius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from cognomina ending in inus the root of the name is safineis cognate with the latin sabinus the oscan name for the sabellic peoples including the sabines and samnites the chief praenomina of the safinii were lucius gaius and marcus the three most common names throughout all periods of roman history other common praenomina were occasionally used including publius quintus and titus septimus appears in a filiation it was quite rare as a praenomen but a fairly common surname in which form might have been used in the filiation instead of a praenomen the safinii of imperial times used a wide variety of personal cognomina but a number of this gens bore the surname rufus or its diminutive rufinus originally given to someone with red hair at least some of these probably constituted a distinct family of the safinii other surnames that might have represented stirpes of the safinii include sabellio belonging to a class of surnames derived from the names of peoples and places undoubtedly alluding to the sabellic origin of the gens

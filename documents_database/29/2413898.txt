the second most used category of bombs was the sd series which were high explosive bombs but with thicker casings which meant their charge to weight ratio was only 30 to 40 of their total weight at first glance they were difficult to distinguish from the sc series of bombs but the two series were color coded the sc series having yellow tail stripes while the sd series had red tail stripes bombs in this series were the sd 1 sd 1 frz sd 2 sd 10 a sd 10 frz sd 10 c sd 15 sd 50 sd 70 sd 250 sd 500 sd 1400 and sd 1700 the number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb the sd series was used primarily in two roles that were determined by the type of fuze and accessories fitted to the bomb the first was as a fragmentation bomb with instantaneous fuze and when the bombs exploded above ground the case created large fragments which would kill enemy personnel and destroy unarmored vehicles the second role was as a general purpose or armor piercing role in this role the bombs were fitted with a time delay

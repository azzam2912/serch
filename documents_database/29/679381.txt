the hypothesis can be seen to arise as a natural consequence of the block spin renormalization procedure when the block size is chosen to be of the same size as the correlation length widom scaling is an example of universality the critical exponents formula 1 and formula 2 are defined in terms of the behaviour of the order parameters and response functions near the critical point as follows where near the critical point widom s scaling relation reads where formula 11 has an expansion with formula 13 being wegner s exponent governing the approach to scaling the scaling hypothesis is that near the critical point the free energy formula 14 in formula 15 dimensions can be written as the sum of a slowly varying regular part formula 16 and a singular part formula 17 with the singular part being a scaling function i e a homogeneous function so that then taking the partial derivative with respect to h and the form of m t h gives setting formula 20 and formula 21 in the preceding equation yields comparing this with the definition of formula 24 yields its value similarly putting formula 26 and formula 27 into the scaling relation for

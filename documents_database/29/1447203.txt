this fungus was originally described by french mycologist narcisse th ophile patouillard in 1915 as daedalea philippinensis fruit bodies of diacanthodes fungi have circular caps that may be partially funnel shaped infudibuliform and a surface texture ranging from tomentose covered with densely entangled hairs to strigose with stiff sharp pointed hairs the colour of the pore surface is light brown but it darkens with time diacanthodes has a dimitic hyphal system meaning it contains both generative hyphae and skeletal hyphae the generative hyphae have clamp connections the skeletal hyphae are thick walled to solid and have a weak dextrinoid reaction the spores are broadly ellipsoid ornamented and dextrinoid leif ryvarden suggests that bondarzewia may be the genus most closely related to diacanthodes based on morphological similarities both genera feature ornamented spores the same hyphal system and similar habit they differ in microscopic characteristics bondartzewia fungi have clampless generative hyphae no cystidia and amyloid spores diacanthodes has a pantropical distribution its fruit bodies occur on the ground

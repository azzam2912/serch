aquaver is acknowledged to be the first company worldwide to develop commercial systems based on membrane distillation a novel technology for water treatment the technology of the aquaver systems is based on membrane distillation membrane distillation combines membrane separation and distillation with hydrophobic membranes and differences in vapour pressure the vacuum multi effect membrane distillation vmemd configuration used in aquaver systems adds the advantages of low temperature operation and multi effects to the membrane distillation characteristics aquaver has collaborated with memsys and philips to develop its water treatment systems aquaver membrane distillation units are focused at desalination industrial water treatment and difficult to treat waters in february 2014 aquaver commissioned in gulhi maldives the world s first desalination plant based on membrane distillation the desalination plant makes use of the waste heat produced by the existing diesel generators which provide electricity to the island to power the water purification process aquaver is also participating with abengoa and masdar in a 7 9 million dollar project to develop an innovative desalination pilot plant in ghantoot city in abu dhabi s border with dubai the desalination plant will have a capacity of producing 1 000 m3 d of desalted water using a

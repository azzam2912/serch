these include both cosmic radiation and environmental radioactivity from naturally occurring radioactive materials such as radon and radium as well as man made medical x rays fallout from nuclear weapons testing and nuclear accidents background radiation is defined by the international atomic energy agency as dose or dose rate or an observed measure related to the dose or dose rate attributable to all sources other than the one s specified so a distinction is made between dose which is already in a location which is defined here as being background and the dose due to a deliberately introduced and specified source this is important where radiation measurements are taken of a specified radiation source where the existing background may affect this measurement an example would be measurement of radioactive contamination in a gamma radiation background which could increase the total reading above that expected from the contamination alone however if no radiation source is specified as being of concern then the total radiation dose measurement at a location is generally called the background radiation and this is usually the case where an ambient dose rate is measured for environmental purposes background radiation varies with location and time and the following

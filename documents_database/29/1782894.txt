it behaves as a selective combined 5 ht receptor inverse agonist and adrenergic receptor antagonist at all three subtypes and with additional 5 ht and to a lesser extent 5 ht receptor antagonistic properties and lacks any apparent affinity for the monoamine reuptake transporters or for the adrenergic h or mach receptors this profile of activity is compatible with the definition of a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant nassa and as such s32212 could in turn be classified as a nassa if it reaches the market in animal studies s32212 raised bdnf concentrations in the hippocampus and amygdala increased the firing rate of neurons in the adrenergic perikarya in the locus coeruleus increased levels of norepinephrine in the frontal cortex and hippocampus and elevated frontal cortex levels of dopamine and acetylcholine though not of serotonin or histamine it produces effects indicative of antidepressant anxiolytic antiobsessional antiaggressive and cognitive and sleep enhancing properties in animal models all while not perturbing body weight or sexual behavior

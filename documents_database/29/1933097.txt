vir 576 is synthetic peptide that binds to hiv 1 s hydrophobic fusion peptide gp41 preventing the virus from inserting itself into a host cell s membrane to initiate an infection this drug is a synthesized variant of a highly specific natural entry inhibitor designated as virip virus inhibitory peptide the design of vir 576 was based on virip which in turn was discovered in 2007 by frank kirchhoff and coworkers this product is being developed by viro pharmaceuticals gmbh co kg in 2007 a new natural peptide was discovered in the human organism and was called virip it is generated from alpha 1 antitrypsin a protease inhibitor that belongs to the serine family by matrix metalloproteinases it was shown that it could interact with the hiv 1 and stop the virus multiplication in spite of interacting in a highly intensity with gp 41 the virip did not prevent the multiplication of the virus so it was decided to increase the efficacy of this molecule creating other ones that could be more powerful among these 600 created molecules there was the vir 576 which was synthesized using the solid phase peptide synthesis method moreover another molecule was used to protect

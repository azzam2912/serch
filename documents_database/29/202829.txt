this triangle is also called a drafting triangle hence the name this triangle is also half of an equilateral triangle and a polydrafter s cells must consist of halves of triangles in the triangular tiling of the plane equivalently when two drafters share an edge that is the middle of their three edge lengths they must be reflections rather than rotations of each other any contiguous subset of halves of triangles in this tiling is allowed so unlike most polyforms a polydrafter may have cells joined along unequal edges a hypotenuse and a short leg polydrafters were invented by christopher monckton who used the name polydudes for polydrafters that have no cells attached only by the length of a short leg monckton s eternity puzzle was composed of 209 12 dudes the term polydrafter was coined by ed pegg jr who also proposed as a puzzle the task of fitting the 14 tridrafters all possible clusters of three drafters into a trapezoid whose sides are 2 3 2 and 5 times the length of the hypotenuse of a drafter like polyominoes polydrafters can be enumerated in two ways depending on whether chiral pairs of polydrafters are counted as one polydrafter

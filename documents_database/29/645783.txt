birds are categorized as a biological class aves for more than a century the small theropod dinosaur archaeopteryx lithographica from the late jurassic period was considered to have been the earliest bird modern phylogenies place birds in the dinosaur clade theropoda according to the current consensus aves and a sister group the order crocodilia together are the sole living members of an unranked reptile clade the archosauria four distinct lineages of bird survived the cretaceous paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago giving rise to ostriches and relatives paleognathae ducks and relatives anseriformes ground living fowl galliformes and modern birds neoaves phylogenetically aves is usually defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of a specific modern bird species such as the house sparrow passer domesticus and either archaeopteryx or some prehistoric species closer to neornithes to avoid the problems caused by the unclear relationships of archaeopteryx to other theropods if the latter classification is used then the larger group is termed avialae currently the relationship between dinosaurs archaeopteryx and modern birds is still under debate there is significant evidence that birds emerged within theropod dinosaurs specifically that birds are members of maniraptora a group of theropods which

owing to the relevance of thermodynamics in much of science and technology its history is finely woven with the developments of classical mechanics quantum mechanics magnetism and chemical kinetics to more distant applied fields such as meteorology information theory and biology physiology and to technological developments such as the steam engine internal combustion engine cryogenics and electricity generation the development of thermodynamics both drove and was driven by atomic theory it also albeit in a subtle manner motivated new directions in probability and statistics see for example the timeline of thermodynamics the ancients viewed heat as that related to fire in 3000 bc the ancient egyptians viewed heat as related to origin mythologies in the western philosophical tradition after much debate about the primal element among earlier pre socratic philosophers empedocles proposed a four element theory in which all substances derive from earth water air and fire the empedoclean element of fire is perhaps the principal ancestor of later concepts such as phlogin and caloric around 500 bc the greek philosopher heraclitus became famous as the flux and fire philosopher for his proverbial utterance all things are flowing heraclitus argued that the three principal elements in nature were fire earth

being passive facilitated transport does not directly require chemical energy from atp hydrolysis in the transport step itself rather molecules and ions move down their concentration gradient reflecting its diffusive nature facilitated diffusion is different from simple diffusion in several ways polar molecules and large ions dissolved in water cannot diffuse freely across the plasma membrane due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid tails of the phospholipids that make up the lipid bilayer only small non polar molecules such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse easily across the membrane hence no nonpolar molecules are transported by proteins in the form of transmembrane channels these channels are gated meaning that they open and close and thus deregulate the flow of ions or small polar molecules across membranes sometimes against the osmotic gradient larger molecules are transported by transmembrane carrier proteins such as permeases that change their conformation as the molecules are carried across e g glucose or amino acids non polar molecules such as retinol or lipids are poorly soluble in water they are transported through aqueous compartments of cells or through extracellular space by water soluble carriers e g retinol binding protein the metabolites are not altered

deformations of group hopf algebras are foundational in the theory of quantum groups let g be a group and k a field the group hopf algebra of g over k denoted kg or k g is as a set and vector space the free vector space on g over k as an algebra its product is defined by linear extension of the group composition in g with multiplicative unit the identity in g this product is also known as convolution note that while the group algebra of a finite group can be identified with the space of functions on the group for an infinite group these are different the group algebra consisting of finite sums corresponds to functions on the group that vanish for cofinitely many points topologically using the discrete topology these correspond to functions with compact support however the group algebra k g and the space of functions k hom g k are dual given an element of the group algebra formula 1 and a function on the group formula 2 these pair to give an element of k via formula 3 which is a well defined sum because it is finite we give kg the structure of

the actual geyser is not visible as it plays underwater at the bottom of the lake however fumaroles are visible on the lake s shore and the rock wall behind it the water temperature in the lake ranges from with acidity up to ph 2 2 and lake levels that vary up to following a complicated 38 day cycle that includes an overflow stage white silica deposits grow up to the overflow level and the lake s colour is a result of finely divided silica suspended in the water at low water levels the lake can be a dull grey colour changing to an intensely sky blue colour at higher lake levels in particular after the overflow stage inferno crater was blasted out of the side of the locally prominent mt haszard as part of the 1886 mount tarawera eruption which opened several craters along a rift stretching southwest from mount tarawera to the nearby southern crater inferno crater s trumpet shaped lake bed is up to deep when the lake is full which is also when it reaches its highest temperature since 1901 the lake occupying inferno crater has exhibited water level variations closely associated with the waimangu geyser

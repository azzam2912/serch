application of transcendental methods to algebraic geometry falls in this category together with more geometric aspects of complex analysis throughout this article analytic is often dropped for simplicity for instance subvarieties or hypersurfaces refer to analytic ones following the convention in wikipedia varieties are assumed to be irreducible an analytic subset of a complex analytic manifold m is locally the zero locus of some family of holomorphic functions on m it is called an analytic subvariety if it is irreducible in the zariski topology throughout this section x denotes a complex manifold accordance with the definitions of the paragraph line bundles and divisors in projective varieties let the regular functions on x be denoted formula 1 and its invertible subsheaf formula 2 and let formula 3 be the sheaf on x associated with formula 4 the total ring of fractions of formula 5 where formula 6 are the open affine charts then a global section of formula 7 means multiplicative group is called a cartier divisor on x let formula 8 be the set of all isomorphism classes of line bundles on x it is called the picard group of x and is naturally isomorphic to formula 9 taking the

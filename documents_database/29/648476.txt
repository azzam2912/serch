euronychodon is known from teeth only these are similar to those of another coelurosaur tooth genus paronychodon two species of euronychodon have been named to date being a tooth taxon the true affinities of euronychodon are hard to determine the teeth are similar to the better known paronychodon which may be a senior synonym paronychodon was originally described as similar to zapsalis another tooth taxon often considered synonymous with richardoestesia a possible dromaeosaurid it later had many different identifications as a coelurid an ornithomimosaur a dromaeosaurid an archaeopterygid and a troodontid though it could also be another kind of coelurosaurian theropod while most researchers have therefore considered such taxa as representing simply indeterminate theropod teeth a small consensus has found them to belong to the deinonychosauria one study showed that the tooth enamel is identical to that found in byronosaurus a troodontid the remains indicate a small animal estimated at around two meters 6 6 feet the teeth indicate a carnivorous or insectivorous diet taveirosaurus was found at the same locality

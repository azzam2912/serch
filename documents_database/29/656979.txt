the reaction is named after the two swedish chemists ludwig ramberg and birger b cklund the carbanion formed by deprotonation gives an unstable episulfone that decomposes with elimination of sulfur dioxide this elimination step is considered to be a concerted cycloelimination the overall transformation is the conversion of the carbon sulfur bonds to a carbon carbon double bond the original procedure involved halogenation of a sulfide followed by oxidation to the sulfone recently the preferred method has reversed the order of the steps after the oxidation which is normally done with a peroxy acid halogenation is done under basic conditions by use of dibromodifluoromethane for the halogen transfer step this method was used to synthesize 1 8 diphenyl 1 3 5 7 octatetraene the ramberg b cklund reaction has several applications due to the nature of elimination it can be applied to both small rings and large rings containing a double bond the necessary halo sulfones are accessible through oxidation of the corresponding halo sulfides with peracids such as meta chloroperbenzoic acid oxidation of sulfides takes place selectively in the presence of alkenes and alcohols halo sulfides may in turn be synthesized through the treatment of sulfides with halogen electrophiles

it is an improvement over the algorithm of sipser and spielman zemor considered a typical class of sipser spielman construction of expander codes where the underlying graph is bipartite graph sipser and spielman introduced a constructive family of asymptotically good linear error codes together with a simple parallel algorithm that will always remove a constant fraction of errors the article is based on dr venkatesan guruswami s course notes zemor s algorithm is based on a type of expander graphs called tanner graph the construction of code was first proposed by tanner the codes are based on double cover formula 1 regular expander formula 2 which is a bipartite graph formula 2 formula 4 where formula 5 is the set of vertices and formula 6 is the set of edges and formula 5 formula 8 formula 9 formula 10 and formula 8 formula 12 formula 10 formula 14 where formula 8 and formula 10 denotes the set of 2 vertices let formula 17 be the number of vertices in each group i e formula 18 the edge set formula 6 be of size formula 20 formula 21 and every edge in formula 6 has one endpoint in both formula 8

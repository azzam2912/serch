hispana and l slovacus showed a difference in evolutionary history with l coridon the analysis showed that l hispana has a large genetic distance between the two species and that there was allopartic speciation from l coridon l slovacus seems to show that there was sympatry with l coridon but the genetic analysis could not prove this hypothesis so the researchers made the conclusion that this particular species was a local population that has an atavism of bivoltinism the expansion of the species travels from western europe into eastern europe from the ice age refugium into the balkans the starting point for the expansion is in western hungary traveling into the balkans and then into brandenburg and poland this expansion shows that are two routes due to the changes in gene allele frequencies and the degree of homogeneity of the species the two routes are 1 starting in the western tip of hungary traveling into north eastern hungry along the hungarian mountains into eastern slovakia 2 starts in western hungary and travels along the eastern alps into western slovakia and czech republic the expansion caused there to be two unique genetic populations that were separated by mountain ranges and the

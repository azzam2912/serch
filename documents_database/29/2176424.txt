the two main sections of the feather are the shaft and the vane the shaft is composed of the calamus and the rachis the calamus can also be called the quill and is the hollow portion of the shaft that enters the skin follicle while the rachis is the solid portion of the shaft where the barbs attach the vane extends to either side of the rachis and is made up of interconnecting barbs this is considered the most substantial portion of the feather removing debris and organic matter from feathers is a key step in the conservation process here are several of the ways that feathers are typically cleaned by conservators using a small vacuum allows conservators to clean off dust and other particulate debris that is not embedded on to the feather this method cannot be done by conservators when dealing with fragile feathers due to the likelihood of damage certain gentle solvents are typically used to dry clean feathers one such solvent isopropyl alcohol is usually diluted to make it less caustic to the specimen isopropyl alcohol is also a fast drying solution that will not cause the feathers to remain wet for an extended period of

typically this is done in mice since the technology for this process is more refined and there is a high degree of shared sequence complexity between mice and humans the difference between knock in technology and traditional transgenic techniques is that a knock in involves a gene inserted into a specific locus and is thus a targeted insertion a common use of knock in technology is for the creation of disease models it is a technique by which scientific investigators may study the function of the regulatory machinery e g promoters that governs the expression of the natural gene being replaced this is accomplished by observing the new phenotype of the organism in question the bacs and yacs are used in this case so that large fragments can be transferred gene knock in originated as a slight modification of the original knockout technique developed by martin evans oliver smithies and mario capecchi traditionally knock in techniques have relied on homologous recombination to drive targeted gene replacement although other methods using a transposon mediated system to insert the target gene have been developed the use of loxp flanking sites that become excised upon expression of cre recombinase with gene vectors is

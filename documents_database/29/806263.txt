its corresponding concert tour was the 1987 concert series the liner notes dedicate the album to his homeland in kalamata greece respectively dedicated to the town of kalamata greece which stood strong and waited for me one last time the album was reissued in 2009 by valley entertainment in a review by william ruhlmann of allmusic yanni s second album like his first keys to imagination was recorded entirety on synthesizers at his home studio the composer performer makes extensive use of the orchestral possibilities of electronics creating big themes to play across elaborate echoing rhythm tracks unlike much adult alternative music it s constantly stimulating foreground music with an extremely modern sound 1987 selections from keys to imagination and out of silence it was during this year that yanni was putting together his first touring band to promote his album out of silence as well as selections from keys to imagination although i d written as always with an orchestra in mind i couldn t afford one so i reproduced that sound in my studio with my synthesizers but because i wanted to play everything live onstage and not against tape i needed three keyboard players and a drummer

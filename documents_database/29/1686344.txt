it is unique for being present in soluble proteins whereas the vast majority of domains capable of binding carotenoids are intrinsic membrane proteins thus far it has exclusively been found in cyanobacteria among which it is widespread the domain also exists on its own in uncharacterized cyanobacterial proteins referred to as red carotenoid protein rcp the domain adopts an alpha helical structure consisting of two four helix bundles orange carotenoid binding proteins ocp were first identified in cyanobacterial species where they occur associated with phycobilisome in the cellular thylakoid membrane these proteins function in photoprotection and are essential for non photochemical quenching npq in full length ocp the npq activity is regulated by photoactivation by strong blue green light ocp seems to act as a homodimer and binds one molecule of 3 hydroxyechinenone a ketocarotenoid and one chloride ion per subunit the carotenoid binding site is lined with a striking number of methionine residues the n terminal domain of ocp is usually accompanied by a c terminal domain which belongs to the ntf2 superfamily and helps bind the carotenoid ocp can be proteolytically cleaved into a red form rcp which lacks 15 residues from the n terminus and approximately 150

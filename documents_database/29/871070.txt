in europeans and africans shovel shaped upper incisors are uncommon or not present there is a spectrum of the degree of shoveled ness ranging on a scale from 0 to 7 of spatulate incisors to shoveled incisors it was theorized that positive selection for shovel shaped incisors over the spatulate incisors are more commonly found in anthropoids within cultures that used their teeth as tools due to a greater structural strength in increased shovel shaped incisors however more modern research suggests that instead genetics plays a role in the degree of shoveled ness in some instances incisors can present a more pronounced version of this called double shovel shaped when present shovel shaped incisors can indicate correlation among populations and are considered to be one of the non metrical traits in osteology structurally resembling the shovel shaped incisors double shovel shaped incisors are distinguished by a more pronounced mesial ridge comparing to the distal ridge similarly the grades for both shovel shaped incisors and the double shovel shaped incisors in females are significantly greater than that in males shovel shaped dental characteristic are also observed in homo erectus and in neanderthals although the morphology of these shoveled incisors is distinct

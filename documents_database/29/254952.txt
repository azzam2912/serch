a sympodium also referred to as a sympode or pseudaxis is the primary shoot comprising the stronger branches formed during sympodial growth the pattern is similar to dichotomous branching it is characterized by branching along a stem or hyphae in botany sympodial growth occurs when the apical meristem is terminated and growth is continued by one or more lateral meristems which repeat the process the apical meristem may be consumed to make an inflorescence or other determinate structure or it may be aborted if the sympodium is always formed on the same side of the branch bifurcation e g always on the right side the branching structure is called a helicoid cyme or bostryx if the sympodium occurs alternately e g on the right and then the left the branching pattern is called a scorpioid cyme or cincinus also spelled cincinnus leader displacement may result the stem appears to be continuous but is in fact derived from the meristems of multiple lateral branches rather than a monopodial plant whose stems derive from one meristem only dichotomous substitution may result two equal laterals continue the main growth in some orchids the apical meristem of the rhizome forms an ascendent swollen stem

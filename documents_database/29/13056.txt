it is one of the basic shapes in geometry a triangle with vertices a b and c is denoted formula 1 in euclidean geometry any three points when non collinear determine a unique triangle and simultaneously a unique plane i e a two dimensional euclidean space in other words there is only one plane that contains that triangle and every triangle is contained in some plane if the entire geometry is only the euclidean plane there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it however in higher dimensional euclidean spaces this is no longer true this article is about triangles in euclidean geometry and in particular the euclidean plane except where otherwise noted triangles can be classified according to the lengths of their sides hatch marks also called tick marks are used in diagrams of triangles and other geometric figures to identify sides of equal lengths a side can be marked with a pattern of ticks short line segments in the form of tally marks two sides have equal lengths if they are both marked with the same pattern in a triangle the pattern is usually no more than 3 ticks an equilateral triangle has the same

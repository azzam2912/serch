atomic or irreducible geometric objects that the system can handle draw store sometimes the subroutines that draw the corresponding objects are called geometric primitives as well the most primitive primitives are point and straight line segment which were all that early vector graphics systems had in constructive solid geometry primitives are simple geometric shapes such as a cube cylinder sphere cone pyramid torus modern 2d computer graphics systems may operate with primitives which are lines segments of straight lines circles and more complicated curves as well as shapes boxes arbitrary polygons circles a common set of two dimensional primitives includes lines points and polygons although some people prefer to consider triangles primitives because every polygon can be constructed from triangles all other graphic elements are built up from these primitives in three dimensions triangles or polygons positioned in three dimensional space can be used as primitives to model more complex 3d forms in some cases curves such as b zier curves circles etc may be considered primitives in other cases curves are complex forms created from many straight primitive shapes in 3d applications basic geometric shapes and forms are considered to be primitives rather than the above list such shapes

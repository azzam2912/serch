the enzymes belonging to this family include creatine kinase plays an important role in energy metabolism of vertebrates there are at least four different but very closely related forms of ck two isozymes m muscle and b brain are cytosolic while the other two are mitochondrial in sea urchins there is a flagellar isozyme which consists of the triplication of a ck domain a cysteine residue is implicated in the catalytic activity of these enzymes and the region around this active site residue is highly conserved atp guanido phosphotransferases contain a c terminal catalytic domain which consists of a duplication where the common core consists of two beta alpha beta2 alpha repeats the substrate binding site is located in the cleft between n and c terminal domains but most of the catalytic residues are found in the larger c terminal domain they also contain an n terminal domain which has an all alpha fold consisting of an irregular array of 6 short helices

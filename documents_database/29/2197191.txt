as in most scattering experiments it involves subjecting a polymeric sample to incident particles with defined wavelengths and studying the characteristics of the scattered particles angular distribution intensity polarization and so on this method is quite simple and straightforward and does not require special manipulations of the samples which may alter their properties and hence compromise exact results as opposed to crystallographic scattering experiments where the scatterer or target has very distinct order which leads to well defined patterns presenting bragg peaks for example the stochastic nature of polymer configurations and deformations especially in a solution gives rise to quite different results we consider a polymer as a chain of monomers each with its position vector formula 1 and scattering amplitude formula 2 for simplicity it is worthwhile considering identical monomers in the chain such that all formula 3 an incoming ray of light neutrons x ray etc has a wave vector or momentum formula 4 and is scattered by the polymer to the vector formula 5 this enables us to define the scattering vector formula 6 by coherently summing the contributions of all formula 7 monomers we get the scattering intensity from a single polymer as a function of

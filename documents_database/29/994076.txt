it is a highly specific endoglycosidase which cleaves asparagine linked mannose rich oligosaccharides but not highly processed complex oligosaccharides from glycoproteins it is used for research purposes to deglycosylate glycoproteins endoglycosidase h is isolated from streptomyces plicatus or streptomyces griseus its molecular weight is 29 000 daltons the primary structure is described by robbins 1984 endoglycosidase h cleaves the bond in the diacetylchitobiose core of the oligosaccharide between two n acetylglucosamine glcnac subunits directly proximal to the asparagine residue generating a truncated sugar molecule with one n acetylglucosamine residue remaining on the asparagine it deglycosylates mannose glycoproteins but the extent and rate of the deglycosylation depends to a high degree on the nature of the glycoproteins the deglycosylation rate can be increased by denaturation of the glycoproteins e g by carboxymethylation sulfitolysis or by heating in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate the addition of 0 1 m 2 mercaptoethanol highly increases enzyme activity against glycoproteins containing inter or intra molecular disulfide bridges unlike detergents like triton x 100 n octylglucoside or zwitterionic detergents endoglycosidase h endo h is commonly used by cell biologists to monitor posttranslational modification in the golgi apparatus most proteins destined for the cell surface are

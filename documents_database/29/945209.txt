the national energy research scientific computing center nersc reports that they use environment modules to manage nearly all software environment modules is specified as a baseline configuration requirement of the dod high performance computing modernization program hpcmp project baseline configuration team for participating dod supercomputing resource centers dsrcs the modules system is based on modulefiles which specify groups of environment settings that need to be made together modulefiles can be installed in a central location for general use or in a user directory for personal use environment modules modulefiles are written in the tcl tool command language and are interpreted by the modulecmd program via the module user interface the key advantage of environment modules is that it is shell independent and supports all major shells such as bash ksh zsh sh tcsh and csh the second key advantage is that it allows to use multiple versions of the program or package from the same account by just loading proper module those two advantages were instrumental in making environment modules a part of most hpc cluster setups it also inspired several alternative implementation such as lmod from university of texas which is written in lua instead of tcl modulefiles are

mechanisms generally consist of moving components that can include the german scientist reuleaux provides the definition a machine is a combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion in this context his use of machine is generally interpreted to mean mechanism the combination of force and movement defines power and a mechanism manages power to achieve a desired set of forces and movement a mechanism is usually a piece of a larger process or mechanical system sometimes an entire machine may be referred to as a mechanism examples are the steering mechanism in a car or the winding mechanism of a wristwatch multiple mechanisms are machines from the time of archimedes through the renaissance mechanisms were viewed as constructed from simple machines such as the lever pulley screw wheel and axle wedge and inclined plane reuleaux focused on bodies called links and the connections between these bodies called kinematic pairs or joints to use geometry to study the movement of a mechanism its links are modeled as rigid bodies this means that distances between points in a link are assumed to not

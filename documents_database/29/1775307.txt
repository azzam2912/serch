he studied civil engineering at the university of wisconsin madison bachelor s degree 1930 and was from 1930 to 1933 employed as a highway engineer in 1936 he received a phd in mathematics under eberhard hopf at mit from 1936 to 1939 he was an instructor at purdue university in 1939 he became an instructor at stanford university where he became in 1941 assistant professor in 1943 associate professor and in 1946 professor from 1947 to 1950 schaeffer was a professor at purdue university from 1950 to 1957 he was a professor at the university of wisconsin madison and in the academic year 1956 57 the chair of the mathematics department schaeffer worked with donald spencer at stanford university on variational problems of conformal mapping e g coefficient ranges for schlicht functions functions analytic and one to one specifically they worked on special cases of the bieberbach conjecture for which they gave a proof that the third coefficient satisfied the conjectured estimate a result already proved by charles loewner their goal was to give a proof for the fourth coefficient but their approach would have required the numerical integration of about one million differential equations a little later paul garabedian

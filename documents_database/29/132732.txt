n pattern such that the sum of the numbers on each pillar along any axis as well as the main space diagonals is equal to a single number the so called magic constant of the hypercube denoted m n it can be shown that if a magic hypercube consists of the numbers 1 2 n then it has magic number for n 4 this sequence is four five six seven and eight dimensional magic hypercubes of order three have been constructed by j r hendricks marian trenkler proved the following theorem a p dimensional magic hypercube of order n exists if and only if p 1 and n is different from 2 or p 1 a construction of a magic hypercube follows from the proof the r programming language includes a module library magic that will create magic hypercubes of any dimension with n a multiple of 4 change to more modern conventions here after basically k n and n m it is customary to denote the dimension with the letter n and the order of a hypercube with the letter m further in this article the analytical number range 0 m 1 is being used for the regular number

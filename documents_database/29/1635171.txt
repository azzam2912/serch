such compounds are common but are mainly of theoretical interest historically the study of these compounds has provided insights into the mechanisms of migratory insertion reactions in organometallic chemistry sulfur dioxide forms complexes with many transition metals for the most stable complex the metal is in oxidation state 0 or 1 in most cases so binds in monodentate fashion attaching to the metal through sulfur such complexes are further subdivided according to the planarity or pyramidalization at sulfur the various bonding modes are more exotic bonding modes are known for clusters complexes of the transition metals are usually generated simply by treating the appropriate metal complex with so the adducts are often weak in some cases so displaces other ligands a large number of labile o bonded so complexes arise from the oxidation of a suspension of the metals in liquid so an excellent solvent the main reaction of sulfur dioxide promoted by transition metals is its reduction by hydrogen sulfide known as the claus process this reaction is conducted on a large scale as a way to remove hydrogen sulfide that arises in hydrotreating processes in refineries of academic interest so acts like a lewis acid towards the alkyl

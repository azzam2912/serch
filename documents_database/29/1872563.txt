embryo profiling is the estimation of embryo quality by qualification and or quantification of various parameters estimations of embryo quality guides the choice in embryo selection in in vitro fertilization in general embryo profiling for prediction of pregnancy rates focuses mainly on visual profiles and short term biomarkers including expression of rna and proteins preferably in the surroundings of embryos to avoid any damage to them on the other hand embryo profiling for health prediction puts more focus on the genome and where there is a risk of a genetic disorder it more often involves cell sampling from the embryo for preimplantation genetic diagnosis embryo quality is mainly evaluated by microscopy at certain time points using a morphological scoring system this has shown to significantly improve pregnancy rates time lapse microscopy is an expansion of microscopy wherein the morphology of embryos is studied over time as of 2014 time lapse microscopy for embryo quality assessment is emerging from the experimental stage to something with enough evidence for broader clinical use studies using the embryoscope tm time lapse incubator have used several indicators for embryo quality such as direct cleavage from 1 to 3 cells as well as the initiation of

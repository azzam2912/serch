by eliminating cytotoxic copper catalysts the reaction proceeds without live cell toxicity it was developed as a faster alternative to the staudinger ligation with the first generation producing rate constants over 63 times faster although the reaction produces a regioisomeric mixture of triazoles the lack of regioselectivity in the reaction is not a major concern for its applications in bioorthogonal chemistry more regiospecific and less bioorthogonal requirements are best served by the traditional huisgen cycloaddition especially given the low yield and synthetic difficulty compared to the addition of a terminal alkyne of synthesizing a strained cyclooctyne the bioorthogonality of the reaction has allowed the cu free click reaction to be applied within cultured cells live zebrafish and mice oct was the first of all cyclooctynes developed for cu free click chemistry it had only ring strain to drive the reaction forward and the kinetics were barely improved over the staudinger ligation after oct and mofo monofluorinated cyclooctyne the difluorinated cyclooctyne difo was developed an improved synthetic approach to a monofluorosubstituted cyclooctyne mfco was introduced that could be easily converted to a useful reactive intermediate for bioconjugation applications although the reactivity was somewhat slower than the difo the mfco demonstrated excellent

the first maser was built by charles h townes james p gordon and herbert j zeiger at columbia university in 1953 townes nikolay basov and alexander prokhorov were awarded the 1964 nobel prize in physics for theoretical work leading to the maser masers are used as the timekeeping device in atomic clocks and as extremely low noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes and deep space spacecraft communication ground stations modern masers can be designed to generate electromagnetic waves at not only microwave frequencies but also radio and infrared frequencies for this reason charles townes suggested replacing microwave with the word molecular as the first word in the acronym maser the laser works by the same principle as the maser but produces higher frequency coherent radiation at visible wavelengths the maser was the forerunner of the laser inspiring theoretical work by townes and arthur leonard schawlow that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by theodore maiman when the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957 it was originally called the optical maser this was ultimately changed to laser for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation gordon gould is credited with creating this acronym in 1957 the

the size of these conical forms ranged widely from just a few centimeters to well over a meter in length their classic morphology consisted of a lower roughly conical valve that was attached to the seafloor or to neighboring rudists and a smaller upper valve that served as a kind of lid for the organism the small upper valve could take a variety of interesting forms including a simple flat lid a low cone a spiral and even a star shaped form the oldest rudists are found in late jurassic rocks in france the rudists became extinct at the end of the cretaceous apparently as a result of the cretaceous paleogene extinction event it had been thought that this group began a decline about 2 5 million years earlier which culminated in complete extinction half a million years before the end of the cretaceous the extinction of rudist bivalves was stepwise during the maastrichtian end of the cretaceous the rudists are according to different systematic schemes placed in the orders hippuritida hippuritoida or rudistes sometimes rudista order hippuritida bieler carter coan in 2010 also named the non hippuritid families megalodontoidea and chamoidea of megalodontida and venerida respectively as rudists but

then for each pile remove one card collect the removed cards together to form a new pile piles of zero size are ignored if formula 1 is a triangular number that is formula 3 for some formula 4 then it is known that bulgarian solitaire will reach a stable configuration in which the sizes of the piles are formula 5 this state is reached in formula 6 moves or fewer if formula 1 is not triangular no stable configuration exists and a limit cycle is reached in random bulgarian solitaire or stochastic bulgarian solitaire a pack of formula 1 cards is divided into several piles then for each pile either leave it intact or with a fixed probability formula 9 remove one card collect the removed cards together to form a new pile piles of zero size are ignored this is a finite irreducible markov chain in 2004 brazilian probabilist of russian origin serguei popov showed that stochastic bulgarian solitaire spends most of its time in a roughly triangular distribution

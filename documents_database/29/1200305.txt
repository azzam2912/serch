chelating ligands bind to metals more strongly than related monodentate ligands and macrocyclic ligands bind more strongly than typical chelating ligands it follows that bi or polymacrocyclic ligands would bind to metals particularly strongly clathrochelates are usually derived from bimacrocyclic ligands the first examples were derived from the tris dioximate s of cobalt iii and iron ii the synthesis entails replacement of the hydrogen bonded proton center with bf or bor group also well known are the clathrochelates called sepulchrates derived from tris ethylenediamine cobalt iii the insertion and removal of metals from the binding pocket of clathrochelates can be very slow for this reason many clathrochelates are prepared by the reactions of pre coordinated ligands these reactions often do not directly break any metal ligand bonds but occur in the second coordination sphere the slowness of the metal ion exchange enables certain experiments that would otherwise be difficult or impossible for example it is possible to optically resolve the equivalent of co hnchchnh in the absence of the special geometry imposed by the clathrochelate the lifetime of co ii amine complexes is typically very short in this way this family of complexes enables studies on self exchange redox reactions

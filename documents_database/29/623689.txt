developed in 1902 by radio pioneer guglielmo marconi from a method invented in 1895 by new zealand physicist ernest rutherford it was used in marconi wireless stations until around 1912 when it was superseded by vacuum tubes it was widely used on ships because of its reliability and insensitivity to vibration a magnetic detector was part of the wireless apparatus in the radio room of the rms titanic which was used to summon help during its famous 15 april 1912 sinking the primitive spark gap radio transmitters used during the first three decades of radio 1886 1916 could not transmit audio sound and instead transmitted information by wireless telegraphy the operator switched the transmitter on and off with a telegraph key creating pulses of radio waves to spell out text messages in morse code so the radio receiving equipment of the time did not have to convert the radio waves into sound like modern receivers but merely detect the presence or absence of the radio signal the device that did this was called a detector the first widely used detector was the coherer invented in 1890 the coherer was a very poor detector insensitive and prone to false triggering due

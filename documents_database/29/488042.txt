generally blowouts do not form on actively flowing dunes due to the fact that they need to be bound by some extent such as plant roots these depressions usually start on the higher parts of the stabilized dunes on the account that desiccation and disturbances are more considerable which allows for greater surface drag and sediment entrainment when sand is bare most of the time exposures become quickly re vegetative before they could become blowouts and expand however when the opportunities are given wind erosion can lower the exposure surface and create a tunneling affect which increases the wind speed the depression may continue until it hits a non erodible substrate or morphology limits it the eroded substances climbs the steep slopes of the depression and become deposited on the downwind side of the blowout which can form a dune that covers vegetation and lead to a larger area of depression a process that helps create parabolic dunes although there is a wide variety of vegetation that live in dune environments around the world most plant species play a key role in determining whether blowouts will form or not by the result of how strong their protective skins can suppress

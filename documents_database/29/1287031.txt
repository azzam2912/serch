there are many fractal generating programs available both free and commercial mobile apps are available to play or tinker with fractals some programmers create fractal software for themselves because of the novelty and because of the challenge in understanding the related mathematics the generation of fractals has led to some very large problems for pure mathematics fractal generating software creates mathematical beauty through visualization modern computers may take seconds or minutes to complete a single high resolution fractal image images are generated for both simulation modeling as well as random fractals for art fractal generation used for modeling is part of realism in computer graphics fractal generation software can be used to mimic natural landscapes with fractal landscapes and scenery generation programs fractal imagery can be used to introduce irregularity to an otherwise sterile computer generated environment fractals are generated in music visualization software screensavers and wallpaper generators this software presents the user with a more limited range of settings and features sometimes relying a series pre programmed variables because complex images can be generated from simple formula fractals are often used among the demoscene the generation of fractals such as the mandelbrot set is time consuming and requires many

it was introduced by pavel alexandrov and now has many variants and generalisations among them the ech nerve of a cover which in turn is generalised by hypercoverings given an index set i and open sets u contained in x the nerve n is the set of finite subsets of i defined as follows if j belongs to n then any of its subsets is also in n therefore n is an abstract simplicial complex in general the complex n need not reflect the topology of x accurately for example we can cover any n sphere with two contractible sets u and v in such a way that n is an abstract 1 simplex however if we also insist that the open sets corresponding to every intersection indexed by a set in n are also contractible the situation changes in particular the nerve lemma states that if formula 2 is a good cover in that for each formula 3 the set formula 4 is contractible if it is nonempty then the nerve formula 5 is homotopy equivalent to formula 6 this means for instance that a circle covered by three open arcs intersecting in pairs in one arc is modelled

these instruments are typically low power 12 volts are used at remote locations and usually communicate with a data logger or other data acquisition device the protocol follows a master slave configuration whereby a data logger sdi 12 recorder requests data from the intelligent sensors sdi 12 sensors each identified with a unique address the first version of sdi 12 was released in 1988 it was designed by a coalition which included the u s geological survey s hydrologic instrumentation facility hif and a group of private companies the sdi 12 specification is maintained by a non profit corporation called the sdi 12 support group the most recent upgrade version 1 4 was made in may 2017 version 1 4 of sdi 12 defines version 1 3 of sdi 12 defines the standard provides guidelines on transient protection and does not require the use of a specific connector the specification document describes a number of advantages including the sdi 12 specification is in the public domain communication occurs over a single data line in half duplex the digital addressing system allows an sdi recorder to communicate with up to 62 individual sensors only the pre configured sensor matching that address

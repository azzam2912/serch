it involves both development and maintenance the product is defined as finished when it satisfies all of its requirements this model combines the elements of the waterfall model with the iterative philosophy of prototyping the product is decomposed into a number of components each of which is designed and built separately termed as builds each component is delivered to the client when it is complete this allows partial utilization of the product and avoids a long development time it also avoids a large initial capital outlay and subsequent long waiting period this model of development also helps ease the traumatic effect of introducing a completely new system all at once the incremental model applies the waterfall model incrementally the series of releases is referred to as increments with each increment providing more functionality to the customers after the first increment a core product is delivered which can already be used by the customer based on customer feedback a plan is developed for the next increments and modifications are made accordingly this process continues with increments being delivered until the complete product is delivered the incremental philosophy is also used in the agile process model see agile modeling the incremental model

glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions the metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of g protein coupled receptors that have been divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology putative signal transduction mechanisms and pharmacologic properties group i includes grm1 and grm5 and these receptors have been shown to activate phospholipase c group ii includes grm2 and grm3 while group iii includes grm4 grm6 grm7 and grm8 group ii and iii receptors are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic amp cascade but differ in their agonist selectivities the mglur3 receptor encoded by the grm3 gene has been found to be associated with bipolar affective disorder a mutation in the kozak sequence in the 1st exon of the grm3 gene was shown to change translation and transcription of cloned grm3 gene constructs and was significantly associated with bipolar disorder with an odds ratio of 4 4 subsequently a marker in grm3 was implicated in a large genome wide association study of schizophrenia with statistical significance of pmouse brain after treatment with lithium carbonate mglur3 modulators that are significantly selective over the isoform mglur2 are known

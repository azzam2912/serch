crawler based robotic tools are commonly used for in line inspection ili applications in pipelines that cannot be inspected using traditional intelligent pigging tools or unpiggable pipelines robotic ndt tools can also be used for mandatory inspections in inhospitable areas e g tank interiors subsea petroleum installations to minimize danger to human inspectors as these tools are operated remotely by a trained technician or ndt analyst these systems transmit data and commands via either a wire typically called an umbilical cable or tether or wirelessly in the case of battery powered tetherless crawlers robotic ndt tools help pipeline operators and utility companies complete required structural integrity data sets for maintenance purposes in the following applications pipeline conditions that may prevent or hinder a flow driven pig inspection include robotic ndt tools also offer safety advantages in inhospitable areas using robotics for infrastructure inspections can save the department of transportation millions in lane closures and heavy equipment rentals by updating the 50year old methods currently in place for infrastructure inspections the department of fransportation will get better results allowing them to better allocate resources post tension tendons that hold up large concrete structures worldwide e g bridges are still mostly inspected

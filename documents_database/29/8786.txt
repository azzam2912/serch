it infers a function from consisting of a set of training examples in supervised learning each example is a pair consisting of an input object typically a vector and a desired output value also called the supervisory signal a supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function which can be used for mapping new examples an optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances this requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a reasonable way see inductive bias the parallel task in human and animal psychology is often referred to as concept learning in order to solve a given problem of supervised learning one has to perform the following steps a wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available each with its strengths and weaknesses there is no single learning algorithm that works best on all supervised learning problems see the no free lunch theorem there are four major issues to consider in supervised learning a first issue is the tradeoff between bias and variance imagine that we have available several different but equally good training data sets a learning algorithm

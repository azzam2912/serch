for example it can be used in brain imaging to suppress cerebrospinal fluid csf effects on the image so as to bring out the periventricular hyperintense lesions such as multiple sclerosis ms plaques it was invented by dr graeme bydder flair can be used with both three dimensional imaging 3d flair or two dimensional imaging 2d flair by carefully choosing the inversion time ti the signal from any particular tissue can be nulled the appropriate ti depends on the tissue via the formula in other words one should typically use a ti of around 70 of the t value in the case of csf suppression one aims for t weighted images which prioritize the signal of fat over that of water therefore if the long ti inversion time is adjusted to a zero crossing point for water none of its signal is visible the signal of the csf is theoretically being erased from the derived image the flair sequence analysis has been especially useful in the evaluation and study of cns disorders involving post contrast flair images have been added to diagnosis protocol for accurate medical assessment

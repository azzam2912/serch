it is closely related to androstenedione androst 4 ene 3 17 dione androstenediol is a direct metabolite of the most abundant steroid produced by the human adrenal cortex dhea it is less androgenic than the related compound androstenediol and has been found to stimulate the immune system when administered to rats androstenediol in vivo has approximately 1 4 of the androgenicity of dhea 0 54 of the androgenicity of androstenedione and 0 21 of the androgenicity of testosterone androstenediol possesses potent estrogenic activity similarly to dhea and 3 androstanediol it has approximately 6 and 17 of the affinity of estradiol at the er and er respectively although androstenediol has far lower affinity for the ers compared to the major estrogen estradiol it circulates at approximately 100 fold higher concentrations and so is thought may play a significant role as an estrogen in the body androstenediol also known as androst 5 ene 3 17 diol is a naturally occurring androstane steroid it is closely related structurally to androstenedione a4 androst 4 ene 3 17 dione dehydroepiandrosterone dhea androst 5 en 3 ol 17 one and testosterone androst 4 en 17 ol 3 one as well as to 3 androstanediol 5 androstane

sirt2 is an nad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent deacetylase studies of this protein have often been divergent highlighting the dependence of pleiotropic effects of sirt2 on cellular context the natural polyphenol resveratrol is known to exert opposite actions on neural cells according to their normal or cancerous status similar to other sirtuin family members sirt2 displays a ubiquitous distribution sirt2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and organs and has been detected particularly in metabolically relevant tissues including the brain muscle liver testes pancreas kidney and adipose tissue of mice of note sirt2 expression is much higher in the brain than all other organs studied particularly in the cortex striatum hippocampus and spinal cord studies suggest that the human sirtuins may function as intracellular regulatory proteins with mono adp ribosyltransferase activity cytosolic functions of sirt2 include the regulation of microtubule acetylation control of myelination in the central and peripheral nervous system and gluconeogenesis there is growing evidence for additional functions of sirt2 in the nucleus during the g2 m transition nuclear sirt2 is responsible for global deacetylation of h4k16 facilitating h4k20 methylation and subsequent chromatin compaction in response to dna damage sirt2 was also found to deacetylate h3k56

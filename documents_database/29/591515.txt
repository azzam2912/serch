the sites are generally located in remote high mountain watersheds where access is often difficult or restricted access for maintenance by the nrcs includes various modes from hiking and skiing to helicopters all snotel sites measure snow water content accumulated precipitation and air temperature some sites also measure snow depth soil moisture and temperature wind speed solar radiation humidity and atmospheric pressure these data are used to forecast yearly water supplies predict floods and for general climate research installation of snotel began in the mid 1960s its use in climate forecasting was not originally envisioned but it has become the standard climate data for western u s locations which are elevated sufficiently to have at least a seasonal snowpack ongoing algorithm upgrades correct and backfill missing data while improvements in communications improve the overall quality of data collection snotel uses meteor burst communications technology to collect and communicate data in near real time vhf radio signals are reflected at a steep angle off the ever present band of ionized meteors existing from about 50 to 75 miles 80 to 120 km above the earth satellites are not involved the nrcs operates and controls the entire system sites are designed to

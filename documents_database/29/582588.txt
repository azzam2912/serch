the human p110 protein is encoded by the pik3ca gene its role was uncovered by molecular pathological epidemiology mpe phosphatidylinositol 4 5 bisphosphate 3 kinase also called phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pi3k is composed of an 85 kda regulatory subunit and a 110 kda catalytic subunit the protein encoded by this gene represents the catalytic subunit which uses atp to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositols ptdins ptdins4p and ptdins 4 5 p2 the involvement of p110 in human cancer has been hypothesized since 1995 support for this hypothesis came from genetic and functional studies including the discovery of common activating pik3ca missense mutations in common human tumors it has been found to be oncogenic and is implicated in cervical cancers pik3ca mutations are present in over one third of breast cancers with enrichment in the luminal and in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive subtypes her2 the three hotspot mutation positions glu542 glu545 and his1047 have been widely reported till date while substantial preclinical data show an association with robust activation of the pathway and resistance to common therapies clinical data do not indicate that such mutations are associated with high levels of pathway activation or with a poor prognosis it is unknown

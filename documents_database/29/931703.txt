it is the oldest house in chelmsford and has been preserved by the garrison house society as a museum it was listed on the national register of historic places in 1973 the exact date the building was erected is not known it is claimed by the society to have been built before 1691 when it is claimed to be one of the houses listed as a garrison house in chelmsford but a 1702 deed transferring land on which it stands does not mention it thomas adams deeded the land to his son peletiah adams in 1683 and peletiah deeded the land to his two sons in 1702 who probably built the house stylistic analysis of its construction also supports a post 1700 construction date the same stylistic analysis casts doubt on the belief that the house actually served as a fortified garrison before the title passed to the garrison house society in 1952 only three families had previously owned it very few modifications had been made to it in all that time making it a relatively accurate historic showpiece the house now shares its lot with a barn summer kitchen a working blacksmith shop an herb garden a craft house

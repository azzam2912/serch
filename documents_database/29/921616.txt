multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene kit was first described by the german biochemist axel ullrich in 1987 as the cellular homolog of the feline sarcoma viral oncogene v kit cd117 is a cytokine receptor expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells as well as other cell types altered forms of this receptor may be associated with some types of cancer cd117 is a receptor tyrosine kinase type iii which binds to stem cell factor a substance that causes certain types of cells to grow also known as steel factor or c kit ligand when this receptor binds to stem cell factor scf it forms a dimer that activates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that in turn phosphorylates and activates signal transduction molecules that propagate the signal in the cell after activation the receptor is ubiquitinated to mark it for transport to a lysosome and eventual destruction signaling through cd117 plays a role in cell survival proliferation and differentiation for instance cd117 signaling is required for melanocyte survival and it is also involved in haematopoiesis and gametogenesis like other members of the receptor tyrosine kinase iii family cd117 consists of an extracellular domain

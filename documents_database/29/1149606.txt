it guarantees very strong security properties protocols remain secure even if arbitrarily composed with other instances of the same or other protocols security is defined in the sense of protocol emulation intuitively a protocol is said to emulate another one if no environment observer can distinguish the executions literally the protocol may simulate the other protocol without having access to the code the notion of security is derived by implication assume a protocol formula 1 is secure per definition if another protocol formula 2 emulates protocol formula 1 such that no environment tells apart the emulation from the execution of the protocol then the emulated protocol formula 2 is as secure as protocol formula 1 an ideal functionality is a protocol in which a trusted party that can communicate over perfectly secure channels with all protocol participants computes the desired protocol outcome we say that a cryptographic protocol that cannot make use of such a trusted party fulfils an ideal functionality if the protocol can emulate the behaviour of the trusted party for honest users and if the view that an adversary learns by attacking the protocol is indistinguishable from what can be computed by a simulator that only interacts

it is the first example of an rna expressed on one chromosome that has been found to influence transcription on another chromosome the hotair gene contains 6 232 bp and encodes 2 2 kb long noncoding rna molecule which controls gene expression its source dna is located within a hoxc gene cluster it is shuttled from chromosome 12 to chromosome 2 by the suz twelve protein the 5 end of hotair interacts with a polycomb group protein polycomb repressive complex 2 prc2 and as a result regulates chromatin state it is required for gene silencing of the hoxd locus by prc2 the 3 end of hotair interacts with the histone demethylase lsd1 it is an important factor in the epigenetic differentiation of skin over the surface of the body skin from various anatomical positions is distinct e g the skin of the eyelid differs markedly from that on the sole of the foot hotair is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancers high levels of expression in primary breast tumours are a significant predictor of subsequent metastasis and death this is partially due to hotair mediated overexpression of the her2 oncogene through sequestration of mir 133 3p which is a negative

it is composed of four detectors that operate simultaneously at different wavelengths all four were in use until 15 may 2009 when its cryostat ran out of liquid helium the spacecraft is operating as a warm extended mission in which two of the four detectors remain functional during its primary mission irac was able to simultaneously operate in four wavelengths 3 6 m 4 5 m 5 8 m and 8 0 m each infrared detector has a resolution of 256 256 pixels a significant improvement over previous spaceborne infrared telescopes and each image taken covers 5 12 square arcminutes of sky the detectors operating at 3 6 m and 4 5 m were constructed with indium antimonide insb while the 5 8 m and 8 0 m detectors were made of silicon doped with arsenic si as the telescope s primary and secondary mirrors along with its supporting structure were made mostly of beryllium the telescope was cryogenically cooled to the 3 6 m and 4 5 m detectors operated at and the 5 8 m and 8 0 m detectors operated at after spitzer liquid helium coolant ran out on 15 may 2009 the spacecraft warmed up over

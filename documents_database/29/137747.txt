the formula of the butyrate ion is the name is used as part of the name of esters and salts of butyric acid as a short chain fatty acid butyric acid is fully ionized near neutral ph in nature the cation associated with butyrate is unknown or unimportant to the metabolizing enzymes butyrates are important as food for cells lining the mammalian colon colonocytes without butyrates for energy colon cells undergo autophagy self digestion and die short chain fatty acids scfas which include butyrate are produced by beneficial colonic bacteria probiotics that feed on or ferment prebiotics which are plant products that contain adequate amounts of dietary fiber these scfas benefit the colonocytes cells of the colon by increasing energy production and cell proliferation and may protect against colon cancer butyrate is a major metabolite in colonic lumen arising from bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and has been shown to be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response in fact butyrate is responsible for about 70 of energy from the colonocytes being a critical scfa in the colon homeostasis butyrate possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation mediated ulcerative colitis uc and colorectal cancer the reason why

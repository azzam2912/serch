high dimensional statistics relies on the theory of random vectors in many applications the dimension of the data vectors may be larger than the sample size traditionally statistical inference considers a probability model for a population and considers data that arose as a sample from the population for many problems the estimates of the population characteristics parameters can be substantially refined in theory as the sample size increases toward infinity a traditional requirement of estimators is consistency that is the convergence to the unknown true value of the parameter in 1968 andrey kolmogorov proposed another setting of statistical problems and another setting for the asymptotics in which the dimension of variables p increases along with the sample size n so that the ratio p n tends to a constant it was called the increasing dimension asymptotics or the kolmogorov asymptotics kolmogorov s approach makes it possible to isolate many principal terms of error probabilities and of standard measures of the quality of estimators quality functions for large p and n recently researchers are more interested in even larger dimension cases e g formula 1 where formula 2 these cases emerge from the need of extracting meaningful information from many different

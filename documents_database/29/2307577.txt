it contains one of the most massive known black holes with a mass of because quasars were not recognized until 1963 the nature of this object was unknown when it was first noted in a 1957 survey of faint blue stars mainly white dwarfs that lie away from the plane of the milky way on photographic plates taken with the 0 7m schmidt telescope at the tonantzintla observatory in mexico it appeared decidedly violet and was listed as number 618 in the tonantzintla catalogue in 1970 a radio survey at bologna discovered radio emission from ton 618 indicating that it was a quasar marie helene ulrich then obtained optical spectra of ton 618 at the mcdonald observatory which showed emission lines typical of a quasar from the redshift of the lines ulrich deduced that ton 618 was very distant and hence was one of the most luminous quasars known as a quasar ton 618 is believed to be an accretion disc of intensely hot gas swirling around a giant black hole in the center of a galaxy the light originating from the quasar is estimated to be 10 4 billion years old the surrounding galaxy is not visible from earth

the chemical concept of oxidation state mainly refers to the valence state of one element while mantle oxidation state provides the degree of decreasing of increasing valence states of all polyvalent elements in mantle materials confined in a closed system the mantle oxidation state is controlled by oxygen fugacity and can be benchmarked by specific groups of redox buffers mantle oxidation state changes because of the existence of polyvalent elements elements with more than one valence state e g fe cr v ti ce eu c and others among them fe is the most abundant 8 wt of the mantle and its oxidation state largely reflects the oxidation state of mantle examining the valence state of other polyvalent elements could also provide the information of mantle oxidation state it is well known that the oxidation state can influence the partitioning behavior of elements and liquid water between melts and minerals the speciation of c o h bearing fluids and melts as well as transport properties like electrical conductivity and creep the formation of diamond requires both reaching high pressures and high temperatures and a carbon source the most common carbon source in deep earth is not elemental carbon and redox

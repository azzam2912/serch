phorbol esters can directly stimulate protein kinase c pkc the n terminal region of pkc known as c1 has been shown phorbol esters such as pma are analogues of dag and potent tumor promoters that cause a variety of physiological changes when administered to both cells and tissues dag activates a family of serine threonine protein kinases collectively known as protein kinase c pkc phorbol esters can directly stimulate pkc the n terminal region of pkc known as c1 binds pma and dag in a phospholipid and zinc dependent fashion the c1 region contains one or two copies of a cysteine rich domain which is about 50 amino acid residues long and which is essential for dag pma binding the dag pma binding domain binds two zinc ions the ligands of these metal ions are probably the six cysteines and two histidines that are conserved in this domain akap13 araf arhgap29 arhgef2 braf cdc42bpa cdc42bpb cdc42bpg chn1 chn2 cit dgka dgkb dgkd dgke dgkg dgkh dgki dgkk dgkq dgkz gmip hmha1 ksr1 ksr2 myo9a myo9b pdzd8 prkca prkcb1 prkcd prkce prkcg prkch prkci prkcn prkcq prkcz prkd1 prkd2 prkd3 racgap1 raf1 rasgrp rasgrp1 rasgrp2 rasgrp3 rasgrp4 rassf1 rassf5 rock1 rock2

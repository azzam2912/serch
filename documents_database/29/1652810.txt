it is assumed that the linderman effect acting independently does not cause noticeable changes to the standard deviation the linderman effect occurs mainly in groups of two or three individuals working within a high stress environment it has been noted from preliminary tests that the linderman effect mainly occurs in academic fields such as chemistry biology and physics the linderman effect has not yet been studied in other high stress environments such as a rescue worker or a person in the medical profession the linderman effect was originally studied during the fall of 2009 the study was performed at universities across the upper midwest of the us to test the variability of the linderman effect two to three students were placed in groups and were assigned laboratory tasks associated with sophomore level science majors the first test involved the process of making twelve dilutions from 120ppm solutions of acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine the solutions were then tested using diode array spectroscopy to determine the exact concentration of each dilution the second test involved a general physics based laboratory exercise the students were required to induce a current on a pre assembled apparatus and study the relative effects of a varying

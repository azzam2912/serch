since the 1980s it has become common to restart the chant the next time the shooter touches the ball in collegiate basketball home crowds were found to initially chant when the air ball shot was made from a distance and when it resulted in a lost possession home crowds were also more persistent in their chants when the shot was made farther from the basket an archival exploration showed that away players who shot an air ball had a lower success rate in the shot immediately after as compared to home players launching the same shot however this difference was unrelated to the chant

for example if a set of vertical lines is presented to one eye and a set of horizontal lines to the same region of the retina of the other sometimes the vertical lines are seen with no trace of the horizontal lines and sometimes the horizontal lines are seen with no trace of the vertical lines at transitions brief unstable composites of the two images may be seen for example the vertical lines may appear one at a time to obscure the horizontal lines from the left or from the right like a traveling wave switching slowly one image for the other binocular rivalry occurs between any stimuli that differ sufficiently including simple stimuli like lines of different orientation and complex stimuli like different alphabetic letters or different pictures such as of a face and of a house very small differences between images however might yield singleness of vision and stereopsis binocular rivalry has been extensively studied in the last century in recent years neuroscientists have used neuroimaging techniques and single cell recording techniques to identify neural events responsible for the perceptual dominance of a given image and for the perceptual alternations when the images presented to the eyes differ

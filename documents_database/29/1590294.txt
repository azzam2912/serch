coating designates an operation as much as the result of it the application of a layer and the layer itself coating takes different meanings depending on the industry concerned this article concerns coating applications in the food industry there are many similarities between coating processes and numerous examples of technology transfer to and from the food industry coating in the food industry is the application of a layer of liquids or solids onto a product the operation essentially relies on mechanical energy it consists mostly in setting the product particles in motion and simultaneously applying the coating ingredient in a certain pattern to expose one to the other it involves such phenomena as adhesion friction viscosity surface tension and crystallisation food coating is not a hard science such as drying or cooling which can be described by equations and are predictable food coating is rather a soft knowledge derived from the accumulation of know how one reason is that the product and the ingredients considered have complex characteristics variations and interactions encapsulation is the application of a liquid layer to very small particles it relies on an array of principles entrapping a molecule inside a matrix chemical bonding and polymerisation

quantum networks facilitate the transmission of information in the form of quantum bits also called qubits between physically separated quantum processors a quantum processor is a small quantum computer being able to perform quantum logic gates on a certain number of qubits quantum networks work in a similar way to classical networks the main difference as will be detailed more in later paragraphs is that quantum networking like quantum computing is better at solving certain problems such as modeling quantum systems networked quantum computing or distributed quantum computing works by linking multiple quantum processors through a quantum network by sending qubits in between them doing this creates a quantum computing cluster and therefore creates more computing potential less powerful computers can be linked in this way to create one more powerful processor this is analogous to connecting several classical computers to form a computer cluster in classical computing like classical computing this system is scale able by adding more and more quantum computers to the network currently quantum processors are only separated by short distances in the realm of quantum communication one wants to send qubits from one quantum processor to another over long distances this way local quantum networks

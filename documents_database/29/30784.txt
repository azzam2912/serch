the anvil shaped small bone is one of three ossicles in the middle ear the incus receives vibrations from the malleus to which it is connected laterally and transmits these to the stapes medially the incus is so called because of its resemblance to an anvil the incus is the second of the ossicles three bones in the middle ear which act to transmit sound it is shaped like an anvil and has a long and short crus extending from the body which articulates with the malleus the short crus attaches to the posterior ligament of the incus the long crus articulates with the stapes at the lenticular process the superior ligament of the incus attaches at the body of the incus to the roof of the tympanic cavity vibrations in the middle ear are received via the tympanic membrane the malleus resting on the membrane conveys vibrations to the incus this in turn conveys vibrations to the stapes incus means anvil in latin several sources attribute the discovery of the incus to the anatomist and philosopher alessandro achillini the first brief written description of the incus was by berengario da carpi in his commentaria super anatomia mundini 1521 andreas

the reactive center can be radical anionic or cationic some cyclic monomers such as norbornene or cyclooctadiene can be polymerized to high molecular weight polymers by using metal catalysts rop is a versatile method for the synthesis of biopolymers ring opening of cyclic monomers is often driven by the relief of bond angle strain thus as is the case for other types of polymerization the enthalpy change in ring opening is negative cyclic monomers that are amenable to rop include epoxides cyclic trisiloxanes some lactones lactides cyclic carbonates and amino acid n carboxyanhydrides many strained cycloalkenes e g norbornene are suitable monomers via ring opening metathesis polymerization ring opening polymerization has been used since the beginning of the 1900s to produce polymers synthesis of polypeptides which has the oldest history of rop dates back to the work in 1906 by leuchs subsequently the rop of anhydro sugars provided polysaccharides including synthetic dextran xanthan gum welan gum gellan gum diutan gum and pullulan mechanisms and thermodynamics of ring opening polymerization were established in the 1950s the first high molecular weight polymers m up to 10 with a repeating unit were prepared by rop as early as in 1976 an industrial application

during this time it made economic sense for manufacturers to make microcomputers aimed at the home user by simplifying the machines and making use of household items such as television sets and cassette recorders instead of dedicated computer peripherals the home computer allowed the consumer to own a computer at a fraction of the price of computers oriented to small business today the price of microcomputers has dropped to the point where there s no advantage to building a separate incompatible series just for home users while many office type personal computers were used in homes in this list a home computer is a factory assembled mass marketed consumer product usually at significantly lower cost than contemporary business computers it would have an alphabetic keyboard and a multi line alphanumeric display the ability to run both games software as well as application software and user written programs and some removable mass storage device such as cassette tape or floppy disk this list excludes smartphones personal digital assistants pocket computers laptop computers programmable calculators and pure video game consoles single board development or evaluation boards intended to demonstrate a microprocessor are excluded since these were not marketed to general consumers pioneering

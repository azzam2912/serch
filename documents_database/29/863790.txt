it was probably delivered in the year 355 354 bc unusually for athenian law courts though demosthenes wrote the speech for ktesippos the son of chabrias he probably delivered it himself it is thus the first speech which demosthenes delivered in a public case during the social war a number of measures were passed in athens to increase public revenue including a law proposed by leptines in 356 which abolished exemptions from liturgies the law made it illegal both for the people of athens to grant exceptions to liturgies and for anybody to request an exception the law was challenged by an athenian called bathippus but he died before the case came to court later this case was taken up by his son apsephion apsephion proposed that leptines law should be repealed and that it should be replaced by a law that provided for a procedure to remove an illegally obtained exemption from liturgies the case came to court in 355 4 bc this law had been proposed by a man named leptines so the speech came to be known as against leptines although dio chrysostom 31 128 9 says that demosthenes won the case his account has been dismissed

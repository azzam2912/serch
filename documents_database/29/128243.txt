some of the widely used formal metalanguages for computer languages are backus naur form bnf extended backus naur form ebnf wirth syntax notation wsn and augmented backus naur form abnf these metalanguages have their own metasyntax each composed of terminal symbols nonterminal symbols and metasymbols a terminal symbol such as a word or a token is a stand alone structure in a language being defined a nonterminal symbol represents a syntactic category which defines one or more valid phrasal or sentence structure consisted of an n element subset metasymbols provide syntactic information for denotational purposes in a given metasyntax terminals nonterminals and metasymbols do not apply across all metalanguages typically the metalanguage for token level languages formally called regular languages does not have nonterminals because nesting is not an issue in these regular languages english as a metalanguage for describing certain languages does not contain metasymbols since all explanation could be done using english expression there are only certain formal metalanguages used for describing recursive languages formally called context free languages that have terminals nonterminals and metasymbols in their metasyntax the metasyntax convention of these formal metalanguages are not yet formalized many metasyntactic variations or extensions exist in the reference

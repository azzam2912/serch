although it is relatively close to the sun at just 12 light years this star cannot be seen with the naked eye it is classified as a flare star that undergoes intermittent fluctuations in luminosity yz ceti is about 13 percent the mass of the sun and 17 of its radius this star is unusually close to tau ceti a star of spectral class g8 the two are only about 1 6 light years apart a little more than a third of the distance from the sun to the solar system s nearest neighbor proxima centauri yz ceti is a variable star designation the star shows occasional rapid and brief increases in brightness sometimes reaching magnitude 12 03 caused by eruptions from the surface this type of variable star is known as a uv ceti star after its first member or more colloquially as a flare star it also shows small periodic variations in brightness caused by starspots or chromospheric features moving as the star rotates this class of variable stars are known as by draconis variables the periodic variations allow the rotational period of the star to be measured at 68 3 days although modelling of its planetary system

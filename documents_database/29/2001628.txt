it had a maximum perceived intensity of vii severe on the mercalli intensity scale originally reported as magnitude 6 6 on the richter scale the earthquake was later downgraded to a magnitude of 6 2 a total of 1112 aftershocks were recorded ranging between magnitudes 2 0 and 4 9 on the richter scale new zealand lies along the boundary between the indo australian plate and pacific plates in the south island most of the relative displacement between these plates is taken up along a single dextral right lateral strike slip fault with a major reverse component the alpine fault in the north island the displacement is mainly taken up along the hikurangi subduction zone although the remaining dextral strike slip component of the relative plate motion is accommodated by the north island fault system nifs the focal mechanism of the earthquake its depth and the distribution of aftershocks show that it was a result of oblique normal faulting within the upper part of the subducting pacific plate with the rupture terminating upwards at the plate interface it was felt strongly down the country from auckland in the north to dunedin in the south and more than 9 000 reports

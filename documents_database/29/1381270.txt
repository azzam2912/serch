the instability causes the galaxy to buckle or bend in a direction perpendicular to its long axis after the instability has run its course the galaxy is less elongated i e rounder than before any sufficiently thin stellar system in which some component of the internal velocity is in the form of random or counter streaming motions as opposed to rotation is subject to the instability the firehose instability is probably responsible for the fact that elliptical galaxies and dark matter haloes never have axis ratios more extreme than about 3 1 since this is roughly the axis ratio at which the instability sets in it may also play a role in the formation of barred spiral galaxies by causing the bar to thicken in the direction perpendicular to the galaxy disk the firehose instability derives its name from a similar instability in magnetized plasmas however from a dynamical point of view a better analogy is with the kelvin helmholtz instability or with beads sliding along an oscillating string the firehose instability can be analyzed exactly in the case of an infinitely thin self gravitating sheet of stars if the sheet experiences a small displacement formula 1 in the formula

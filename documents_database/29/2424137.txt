the goal of assisted evolution is to help species adapt to a changing environment more quickly than they would via natural selection assisted evolution can be used to increase food production and crop yield as well as ensure targeted species to more quickly become resistant to existential threats assisted evolution has been practiced for thousands of years often for commercial and business purposes assisted evolution has come into the public eye in recent years for noncommercial purposes such as species conservation assisted evolution for noncommercial purposes is most notably practiced in the attempt to save coral reefs from rising global ocean temperatures and other climate change related environmental conditions assisted evolution has been practiced for thousands of years for commercial and business purposes selective breeding of asian wolves over 30 000 years ago by hunter gatherers have allowed for the creation of modern breeds such as the german shepherd which are used often for disability assistance search and rescue and police and military roles plant breeding has also benefitted from rapid generation advance rga and single seed descent to speed up the process of natural selection assisted evolution in plants have allowed for increased food production and reduced pesticide use

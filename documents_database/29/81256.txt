only a small percentage of light penetrates the canopy so understory vegetation is generally shade tolerant the understory typically consists of trees stunted through lack of light other small trees with low light requirements saplings shrubs vines and undergrowth small trees such as holly and dogwood are understory specialists in temperate deciduous forests many understory plants start into growth earlier than the canopy trees to make use of the greater availability of light at this time of year a gap in the canopy caused by the death of a tree stimulates the potential emergent trees into competitive growth as they grow upwards to fill the gap these trees tend to have straight trunks and few lower branches at the same time the bushes undergrowth and plant life on the forest floor become more dense the understory experiences greater humidity than the canopy and the shaded ground does not vary in temperature as much as open ground this causes a proliferation of ferns mosses and fungi and encourages nutrient recycling which provides favorable habitats for many animals and plants the understory is the underlying layer of vegetation in a forest or wooded area especially the trees and shrubs growing between the

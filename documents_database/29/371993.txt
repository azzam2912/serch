the surface emission rate ser not the source activity is used as a measure of the rate of particles emitted from the source of radiation the ser is the true emission rate from the surface which is usually different to the activity this difference is due to self shielding within the active layer of the source which will reduce the ser or backscatter which will reflect particles off the backing plate of the active layer and will increase the ser beta particle plate sources usually have a significant backscatter whereas alpha plate sources usually have no backscatter but are easily self attenuated if the active layer is made too thick counting efficiency varies for different isotopes sample compositions and scintillation counters poor counting efficiency can be caused by an extremely low energy to light conversion rate scintillation efficiency which even optimally will be a small value it has been calculated that only some 4 of the energy from a emission event is converted to light by even the most efficient scintillation cocktails proportional counters and end window geiger muller tubes have a very high efficiency for all ionising particles that reach the fill gas nearly every initial ionising event in

the dwadasama was developed by hindu astrologers who broke the 30 degree sign down into 12 equal parts of 2 5 degrees each it is based upon the principle of the part being a reflection of the whole and 12 signs of the zodiac were placed within the confines of one sign it is believed that these signs within a sign by virtue of their planetary rulers account for subtle shadings of expression found in different degrees of that sign therefore in addition to the sign having a primary planetary ruler it would also have a sub ruler based upon which dwadasama it is placed in for example if an individual s sun is placed in 10 degrees 51 minutes aquarius then their sun sign would be ruled by uranus but the dwad being in the range of 10 to 12 5 degrees would be placed within gemini the 5th dwad so the individual s sub ruler would be the mercury which rules gemini a listing of the dwads for each sign is found in the diagram below here we see two ways of dividing the astrological signs combined first the ten degrees decans then the 2 5 degree duads

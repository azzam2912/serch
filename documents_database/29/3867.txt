encyclop dia britannica considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since michael faraday 1791 1867 in early work rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half life the radioactive element radon and differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation this work was performed at mcgill university in montreal canada it is the basis for the nobel prize in chemistry he was awarded in 1908 for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements and the chemistry of radioactive substances for which he was the first canadian and oceanian nobel laureate rutherford moved in 1907 to the victoria university of manchester today university of manchester in the uk where he and thomas royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei rutherford performed his most famous work after he became a nobel laureate in 1911 although he could not prove that it was positive or negative he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus and thereby pioneered the rutherford model of the atom through his discovery and interpretation of rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of hans geiger and ernest marsden he performed the first artificially induced nuclear reaction in 1917 in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were

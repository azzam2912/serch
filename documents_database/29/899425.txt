the simplest bodies or elements of a multibody system were treated by newton free particle and euler rigid body euler introduced reaction forces between bodies later a series of formalisms were derived only to mention lagrange s formalisms based on minimal coordinates and a second formulation that introduces constraints basically the motion of bodies is described by their kinematic behavior the dynamic behavior results from the equilibrium of applied forces and the rate of change of momentum nowadays the term multibody system is related to a large number of engineering fields of research especially in robotics and vehicle dynamics as an important feature multibody system formalisms usually offer an algorithmic computer aided way to model analyze simulate and optimize the arbitrary motion of possibly thousands of interconnected bodies while single bodies or parts of a mechanical system are studied in detail with finite element methods the behavior of the whole multibody system is usually studied with multibody system methods within the following areas the following example shows a typical multibody system it is usually denoted as slider crank mechanism the mechanism is used to transform rotational motion into translational motion by means of a rotating driving beam a connection rod

the technique is used for both hypothesis testing and model building in both these uses models are tested to find the most parsimonious i e least complex model that best accounts for the variance in the observed frequencies a pearson s chi square test could be used instead of log linear analysis but that technique only allows for two of the variables to be compared at a time log linear analysis uses a likelihood ratio statistic formula 1 that has an approximate chi square distribution when the sample size is large where there are three assumptions in log linear analysis 1 the observations are independent and random 2 observed frequencies are normally distributed about expected frequencies over repeated samples this is a good approximation if both a the expected frequencies are greater than or equal to 5 for 80 or more of the categories and b all expected frequencies are greater than 1 violations to this assumption result in a large reduction in power suggested solutions to this violation are delete a variable combine levels of one variable e g put males and females together or collect more data 3 the logarithm of the expected value of the response variable

it is named after karol borsuk in 1932 karol borsuk showed that an ordinary 3 dimensional ball in euclidean space can be easily dissected into 4 solids each of which has a smaller diameter than the ball and generally n dimensional ball can be covered with compact sets of diameters smaller than the ball at the same time he proved that n subsets are not enough in general the proof is based on the borsuk ulam theorem that led borsuk to a general question this can be translated as the question got a positive answer in the following cases the problem was finally solved in 1993 by jeff kahn and gil kalai who showed that the general answer to borsuk s question is no they claim that their construction shows that pieces do not suffice for and for each however as pointed out by bernulf wei bach the first part of this claim is in fact false but after improving a suboptimal conclusion within the corresponding derivation one can indeed verify one of the constructed point sets as a counterexample for n 1325 as well as all higher dimensions up to 1560 their result was improved in 2003 by hinrichs

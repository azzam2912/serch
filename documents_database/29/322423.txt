informally this means that the functions in the family are not widely spread out but rather stick together in a somewhat clustered manner sometimes if each function in a normal family f satisfies a particular property e g is holomorphic then the property also holds for each limit point of the set f more formally let x and y be topological spaces the set of continuous functions formula 1 has a natural topology called the compact open topology a normal family is a pre compact subset with respect to this topology if y is a metric space then the compact open topology is equivalent to the topology of compact convergence and we obtain a definition of that is closer to the classical one a collection f of continuous functions is called a normal family if every sequence of functions in f contains a subsequence which converges uniformly on compact subsets of x to a continuous function from x to y that is for every sequence of functions in f there is a subsequence formula 2 and a continuous function formula 3 from x to y such that the following holds for every compact subset k contained in x formula 4

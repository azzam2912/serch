martin in 1975 and is applied in descriptive set theory to show that borel sets in polish spaces have regularity properties such as the perfect set property and the property of baire the theorem is also known for its metamathematical properties in 1971 before the theorem was proved harvey friedman showed that any proof of the theorem in zermelo fraenkel set theory must make repeated use of the axiom of replacement later results showed that stronger determinacy theorems cannot be proven in zermelo fraenkel set theory although they are relatively consistent with it if certain large cardinals are consistent a gale stewart game is a two player game of perfect information the game is defined using a set a and is denoted g the two players alternate turns and each player is aware of all moves before making the next one on each turn each player chooses a single element of a to play the same element may be chosen more than once without restriction the game can be visualized through the following diagram in which the moves are made from left to right with the moves of player i above and the moves of player ii below formula 1

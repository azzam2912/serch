baphetids were large labyrinthodont predators of the late carboniferous period namurian through westphalian of europe fragmentary remains from the early carboniferous of canada have been tentatively assigned to the group the phylogenetic relationships of baphetids is uncertain while many studies have placed the group as a close relative of amniota other analyses have found baphetidae to be a more basal clade of early stem tetrapods baphetids were among the first of the carboniferous fossil tetrapods to be found and were originally described in 1850 by john william dawson the baphetids have been referred to the family loxommatidae but this group was later shown to be a junior synonym of baphetidae which was named earlier in 1865 baphetids are known mainly from skulls very little postcranial material has been found the presence of lateral lines and the long rows of needle like teeth show that most were fish eaters their development was likely amphibian though no larval fossils are known their best known characteristic was a curious keyhole shaped orbit formed by excavation of the lacrimal and prefrontal bones in front of the eye it has been suggested that this space accommodated a salt gland or some kind of electrosensory organ

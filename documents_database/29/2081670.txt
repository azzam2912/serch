there are 13 exons in the highest quality isoform forming an mrna of 2797 base pairs three other isoforms have been isolated homologs exist as distant as the green sea turtle and chickens at approximately 60 sequence identity suggesting that the gene may have arisen in the amniotes after their divergence from other tetrapods the first 4 exons are conserved with 36 identity as distantly as the anemone the human c12orf40 protein is 652 amino acids in length its molecular weight is predicted to be 74 52 kda and its isoelectric point 7 822 amino acids 229 652 contain a domain of unknown function duf4552 which is conserved in vertebrates c12orf40 is predicted to be a soluble protein with no transmembrane segments its secondary and tertiary structures are not currently known experimental evidence shows that c12orf40 has a physical interaction with dynein light chain 2 dynll2 this protein is part of a complex that regulates the function of the motor protein dynein within the cell c12orf40 is predicted to be present in the nucleus based on signals within its sequence an analysis of normal human tissues shows that c12orf40 expression occurs primarily in the testis suggesting importance to the male

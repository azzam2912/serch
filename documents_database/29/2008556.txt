the planet orbits the sun in 687 days and travels 9 55 au in doing so making the average orbital speed 24 km s the eccentricity is greater than that of every other planet except mercury and this causes a large difference between the aphelion and perihelion distances they are 1 6660 and 1 3814 au mars is in the midst of a long term increase in eccentricity it reached a minimum of 0 079 about 19 millennia ago and will peak at about 0 105 after about 24 millennia from now and with perihelion distances a mere 1 3621 astronomical units the orbit is at times near circular it was 0 002 1 35 million years ago and will be about 0 01 a million years into the future the maximum eccentricity between those two minima is 0 12 mars reaches opposition when there is a 180 difference between the geocentric longitudes of it and the sun at a time near opposition within 8 days the earth mars distance is as small as it will get during that 780 day synodic period every opposition has some significance because mars is visible from earth all night high and fully lit

it is a technical glass ceramic which can be structured without photoresist when it is exposed to shortwave radiation such as ultraviolet light and subsequently etched in february 2016 schott announced the introduction of foturan ii at photonics west foturan ii is characterized by higher homogeneity of the photosensitivity which allows finer microstructures foturan is a lithium aluminosilicate glass system doped with small amounts of silver oxides and cerium oxides foturan can be structured via uv exposure tempering and etching crystal nucleation grow in foturan when exposed to uv and heat treated afterwards the crystalized areas react much faster to hydrofluoric acid than the surrounding vitreous material resulting in very fine microstructures tight tolerance and high aspect ratio if foturan is exposed to light in the ultra violet range with a wavelength of 320 nm eventually via photomask contact lithography or proximity lithography to expose certain patterns a chemical reaction is started in the exposed areas the containing ce transforms into ce and frees an electron during the nucleation tempering 500 c the silver ion ag will be transferred into ag by scavenging the electron released from ce this activates the agglomeration of atomic silver to form nanometer scale silver

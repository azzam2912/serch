water fuelled cars have been the subject of numerous international patents newspaper and popular science magazine articles local television news coverage and websites the claims for these devices have been found to be pseudoscience and some were found to be tied to investment frauds these vehicles may be claimed to produce fuel from water on board with no other energy input or may be a hybrid claiming to derive some of its energy from water in addition to a conventional source such as gasoline water is fully oxidized hydrogen hydrogen itself is a high energy flammable substance but its useful energy is released when water is formed water will not burn the process of electrolysis can split water into hydrogen and oxygen but it takes as much energy to take apart a water molecule as was released when the hydrogen was oxidized to form water in fact some energy would be lost in converting water to hydrogen and then burning the hydrogen because some waste heat would always be produced in the conversions releasing chemical energy from water in excess or in equal proportion to the energy required to facilitate such production would therefore violate the first or second law

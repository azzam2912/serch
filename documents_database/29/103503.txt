in a deterministic system every action or cause produces a reaction or effect and every reaction in turn becomes the cause of subsequent reactions the totality of these cascading events can theoretically show exactly how the system will exist at any moment in time to understand this concept start with a fairly small system visualize a set of three dominoes lined up in a row with each domino less than a domino s length away from its neighbors once the first domino has toppled the third domino will topple because the second will topple upon being contacted by the first domino small deterministic systems are easy to visualize but are necessarily linked to the rest of reality by an initial cause and or final effect to go back to the dominoes something outside the system has to cause the first domino to topple the last domino falling might cause something else outside the system to happen and the system itself must be considered in isolation if external forces such as hurricanes earthquakes or the hands of nearby people were taken into consideration the final domino toppling might not be a predetermined outcome complete isolation of a system is unrealistic but

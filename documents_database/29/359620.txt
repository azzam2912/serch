if it is homotopic to some constant map intuitively a contractible space is one that can be continuously shrunk to a point within that space a contractible space is precisely one with the homotopy type of a point it follows that all the homotopy groups of a contractible space are trivial therefore any space with a nontrivial homotopy group cannot be contractible similarly since singular homology is a homotopy invariant the reduced homology groups of a contractible space are all trivial for a topological space x the following are all equivalent the cone on a space x is always contractible therefore any space can be embedded in a contractible one which also illustrates that subspaces of contractible spaces need not be contractible furthermore x is contractible if and only if there exists a retraction from the cone of x to x every contractible space is path connected and simply connected moreover since all the higher homotopy groups vanish every contractible space is n connected for all n 0 a topological space is locally contractible if every point has a local base of contractible neighborhoods contractible spaces are not necessarily locally contractible nor vice versa for example the comb space is

these proteins have been shown to have diverse functions in the development of the nervous system and play multiple essential roles in vertebrate embryogenesis including cardiac development schwann cell and oligodendrocyte differentiation some aspects of neuronal development as well as the formation of neuromuscular synapses included in the family are heregulin neu differentiation factor acetylcholine receptor synthesis stimulator glial growth factor and sensory and motor neuron derived factor multiple family members are generated by alternate splicing or by use of several cell type specific transcription initiation sites in general they bind to and activate the erbb family of receptor tyrosine kinases erbb2 her2 erbb3 her3 and erbb4 her4 functioning both as heterodimers and homodimers the neuregulin family includes in mammals neuregulin family members are the products of 4 genes nrg1 nrg2 nrg3 and nrg4 respectively the transmembrane forms of neuregulin 1 nrg1 are present within synaptic vesicles including those containing glutamate after exocytosis nrg1 is in the presynaptic membrane where the ectodomain of nrg1 may be cleaved off the ectodomain then migrates across the synaptic cleft and binds to and activates a member of the egf receptor family on the postsynaptic membrane this has been shown to increase the expression

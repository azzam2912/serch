mutations in this gene result in fanconi anemia a nuclear complex containing fancc protein as well as fanca fancf and fancg is essential for the activation of the fancd2 protein to the mono ubiquitinated isoform in normal non mutant cells fancd2 is mono ubiquinated in response to dna damage fancc together with fance acts as the substrate adaptor for this reaction activated fancd2 protein co localizes with brca1 breast cancer susceptibility protein at ionizing radiation induced foci and in synaptonemal complexes of meiotic chromosomes activated fancd2 protein may function prior to the initiation of meiotic recombination perhaps to prepare chromosomes for synapsis or to regulate subsequent recombination events fancc mutant male and female mice have compromised gametogenesis leading to markedly impaired fertility a characteristic of fanconi anemia patients both male and female fancc mutant mice have reduced numbers of germ cells fanconi anemia complementation group c has been shown to interact with

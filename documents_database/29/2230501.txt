the behavior generally takes place within the first few weeks of life and has been documented in some species of insects nematode worms scorpions and other arachnids as well as in caecilian amphibians the specifics of how matriphagy occurs varies among different species but the process is best described in the desert spider stegodyphus lineatus where the mother harbors nutritional resources for her young through food consumption the mother is able to regurgitate small portions of food for her growing offspring but between 1 2 weeks after hatching the progeny capitalize on this food source by eating her alive typically offspring only feed on their biological mother as opposed to other females in the population in other arachnid species matriphagy occurs after the ingestion of nutritional eggs known as trophic eggs e g black lace weaver amaurobius ferox crab spider diaea ergandros and involves different techniques for killing the mother such as transfer of poison via biting and sucking to cause a quick death e g black lace weaver or continuous sucking of the hemolymph resulting in a more gradual death e g crab spider the behavior is less well described but follows a similar pattern in species such as

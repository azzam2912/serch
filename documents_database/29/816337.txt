this roadway adds two three way intersections in addition to the original four way intersection moving all left turns in right hand traffic countries or right turns in left hand traffic countries from the main intersection the design is intended to improve traffic flow by reducing signal timing phases from four to two in the main intersection the design is intended for intersections where large artery routes meet in an area of dense development and high pedestrian volume proponents also point to a reduction in places where accidents could occur from vehicles potentially crossing paths as well as a low development cost compared to roundabouts or the more complex single point urban interchange designs opponents point to the increase in points where accidents could occur with merging traffic as well as the non traditional nature of the design which has the potential to confuse drivers opponents also rebut low cost claims pointing to right of way and construction costs of the quadrant road single quadrant intersections pictured above feature a single quadrant road a double quadrant intersection or two quadrant intersection adds a second quadrant road placed opposite another another variant links grade separated roads generally a faster road with

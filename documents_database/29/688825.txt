the study of lemniscates and in particular the hippopede dates to ancient greek mathematics but the term lemniscate for curves of this type comes from the work of jacob bernoulli in the late 17th century the consideration of curves with a figure eight shape can be traced back to proclus a greek neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who lived in the 5th century ad proclus considered the cross sections of a torus by a plane parallel to the axis of the torus as he observed for most such sections the cross section consists of either one or two ovals however when the plane is tangent to the inner surface of the torus the cross section takes on a figure eight shape which proclus called a horse fetter a device for holding two feet of a horse together or hippopede in greek the name lemniscate of booth for this curve dates to its study by the 19th century mathematician james booth the lemniscate may be defined as an algebraic curve the zero set of the quartic polynomial formula 1 when the parameter d is negative or zero for the special case where the lemniscate becomes a pair of externally tangent circles for

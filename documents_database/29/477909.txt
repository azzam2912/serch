as a tool it is weaker than turing reduction since not every turing reduction between sets can be performed by a truth table reduction but every truth table reduction can be performed by a turing reduction for the same reason it is said to be a stronger reducibility than turing reducibility because it implies turing reducibility a weak truth table reduction is a related type of reduction which is so named because it weakens the constraints placed on a truth table reduction and provides a weaker equivalence classification as such a weak truth table reduction can actually be more powerful than a truth table reduction as a tool and perform a reduction which is not performable by truth table a turing reduction from a set b to a set a computes the membership of a single element in b by asking questions about the membership of various elements in a during the computation it may adaptively determine which questions it asks based upon answers to previous questions in contrast a truth table reduction or a weak truth table reduction must present all of its finitely many oracle queries at the same time in a truth table reduction the reduction also

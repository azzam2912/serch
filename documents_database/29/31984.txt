it provides block level access to storage devices by carrying scsi commands over a tcp ip network iscsi is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage over long distances it can be used to transmit data over local area networks lans wide area networks wans or the internet and can enable location independent data storage and retrieval the protocol allows clients called initiators to send scsi commands cdbs to storage devices targets on remote servers it is a storage area network san protocol allowing organizations to consolidate storage into storage arrays while providing clients such as database and web servers with the illusion of locally attached scsi disks it mainly competes with fibre channel but unlike traditional fibre channel which usually requires dedicated cabling iscsi can be run over long distances using existing network infrastructure iscsi was pioneered by ibm and cisco in 1998 and submitted as a draft standard in march 2000 in essence iscsi allows two hosts to negotiate and then exchange scsi commands using internet protocol ip networks by doing this iscsi takes a popular high performance local storage bus and emulates it over a wide range of networks creating a storage area

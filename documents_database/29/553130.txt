low lignin is important to the resulting strength of the paper as the hydrophobic nature of lignin interferes with the formation of the hydrogen bonds between cellulose and hemicellulose in the fibers kraft pulp is darker than other wood pulps but it can be bleached to make very white pulp fully bleached kraft pulp is used to make high quality paper where strength whiteness and resistance to yellowing are important wood pulp for sack paper is made from softwood by the kraft process the long fibers provide the paper its strength and wet strength chemicals are added to even further improve the strength both white and brown grades are made sack paper is then produced on a paper machine from the wood pulp the paper is microcrepped to give porosity and elasticity microcrepping is done by drying with loose draws allowing it to shrink this causes the paper to elongate 4 in the machine direction and 10 in the cross direction without breaking machine direction elongation can be further improved by pressing between very elastic cylinders causing more microcrepping the paper may be coated with polyethylene pe to ensure an effective barrier against moisture grease and bacteria a paper sack

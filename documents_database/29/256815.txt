landraces are generally distinguished from cultivars and from breeds in the standardized sense although the term landrace breed is sometimes used as distinguished from the term standardized breed when referring to cattle specimens of a landrace tend to be relatively genetically uniform but are more diverse than members of a standardized or formal breed some standardized animal breeds originate from attempts to make landraces more consistent through selective breeding and a landrace may become a more formal breed with the creation of a breed registry and or publication of a breed standard in such a case the landrace may be thought of as a stage in breed development however in other cases formalizing a landrace may result in the genetic resource of a landrace being lost through crossbreeding landraces are distinct from ancestral wild species of modern stock and from separate species or subspecies derived from the same ancestor as modern domestic stock landraces are not all derived from ancient stock largely unmodified by human breeding interests in a number of cases most commonly dogs and horses domestic animals have escaped in sufficient numbers in an area to breed feral populations that through evolutionary pressure can form new landraces in

coli cloning vectors created in 1977 in the laboratory of herbert boyer at the university of california san francisco it was named after francisco bolivar zapata the postdoctoral researcher who constructed it the p stands for plasmid and br for bolivar and rodriguez pbr322 is 4361 base pairs in length and has two antibiotic resistance genes the gene bla encoding the ampicillin resistance amp protein and the gene teta encoding the tetracycline resistance tet protein it contains the origin of replication of pmb1 and the rop gene which encodes a restrictor of plasmid copy number the plasmid has unique restriction sites for more than forty restriction enzymes eleven of these forty sites lie within the tet gene there are two sites for restriction enzymes hindiii and clai within the promoter of the tet gene there are six key restriction sites inside the amp gene the circular sequence is numbered such that 0 is the middle of the unique ecori site and the count increases through the tet gene the amp gene is penicillin beta lactamase promoters p1 and p3 are for the beta lactamase gene p3 is the natural promoter and p1 is artificially created by the ligation of two

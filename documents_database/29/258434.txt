ammonium sulfate is especially useful as a precipitant because it is highly soluble stabilizes protein structure has a relatively low density is readily available and is relatively inexpensive ammonium sulfate as well as other neutral salts will stabilize proteins by preferential solvation proteins are usually stored in ammonium sulfate because it inhibits bacterial growth with the addition of ammonium sulfate proteins unfolded by denaturants can be pushed into their native conformations this can be seen with the folding of recombinant proteins the solubility of proteins varies according to the ionic strength of the solution thus according to the salt concentration at low ion concentrations salting in as the salt concentration is further increased the solubility of the protein begins to decrease at a sufficiently high ionic strength the protein will precipitate out of the solution an effect termed salting out when the ammonium nh and sulfate so ions are within the aqueous solution they are attracted to the opposite charges evident on the compound that is being purified this attraction of opposite charges prevents the water molecules from interacting with the compound being purified leading to the precipitation or salting out proteins differ markedly in their solubilities at high ionic

unicable uses an integrated software and hardware solution that allows unicable certified digital video recorders and receivers to multiplex selected programming when using unicable lnb or multiswitching products the unicable interoperability platform is open to companies designing and or marketing satellite and other broadcast related products the platform is designed to facilitate the acceptance of unicable certified solutions in the consumer tv broadcast market each satellite receiver in the installation has a dedicated user band of a bandwidth approximately the same as a transponder the receiver requests a particular transponder frequency via a diseqc compliant command a mixer in the dish end equipment an lnb or distribution unit converts the received signal to the correct user band if centre frequency for that receiver the converted transponders of the various users are then combined and sent via the single coaxial cable to the receivers the combined signal is tapped or split to reach every user silicon vendors have developed complex integrated circuits that greatly reduce the cost of implementing the single cable distribution function a channel stacking switch ic is a multiple input multiple output device it typically has n inputs that can be cascaded to additional chips as required to

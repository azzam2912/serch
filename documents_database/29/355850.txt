the hbt improves on the bjt in that it can handle signals of very high frequencies up to several hundred ghz it is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits mostly radio frequency rf systems and in applications requiring a high power efficiency such as rf power amplifiers in cellular phones the idea of employing a heterojunction is as old as the conventional bjt dating back to a patent from 1951 detailed theory of heterojunction bipolar transistor was developed by herbert kroemer in 1957 the principal difference between the bjt and hbt is in the use of differing semiconductor materials for the emitter base junction and the base collector junction creating a heterojunction the effect is to limit the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band unlike bjt technology this allows a high doping density to be used in the base reducing the base resistance while maintaining gain the efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the kroemer factor kroemer was awarded a nobel prize in 2000 for his work in this field at the university of california santa barbara materials used for

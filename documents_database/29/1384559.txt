it consists of shale thin bedded limestone and siltstone that was deposited during middle cambrian time 513 to 497 million years ago it is famous for the exceptional preservation of soft bodied fossils the burgess shale biota the formation overlies the cathedral escarpment a submarine cliff consequently it is divided into two quite separate parts the thin sequence deposited in the shallower waters atop the escarpment and the thick sequence deposited in the deeper waters beyond the cliff because the thick stephen formation represents a distinct lithofacies some authors suggest it warrants its own name and dub it the burgess shale formation the stratigraphy of the thin stephen formation has not been subject to extensive study so except where explicitly mentioned this article applies mainly to the thick stephen formation the stephen formation formed at a low latitude miogeoclinic continental margin at the western limit of a continental craton detrital sediments were washed in by rivers from the continent over the limestone reefs which formed the shallow sea floor at the top of sequence stratigraphic cycles oncoids were sometimes washed in to the thin stephen formation from the shallower waters closer to the shore the fossiliferous deposits of the stephen

it is the fundamental reaction in the body by which the body is protected from complex foreign molecules such as pathogens and their chemical toxins in the blood the antigens are specifically and with high affinity bound by antibodies to form an antigen antibody complex the immune complex is then transported to cellular systems where it can be destroyed or deactivated the first correct description of the antigen antibody reaction was given by richard j goldberg at the university of wisconsin in 1952 it came to be known as goldberg s theory of antigen antibody reaction there are several types of antibodies and antigens and each antibody is capable of binding only to a specific antigen the specificity of the binding is due to specific chemical constitution of each antibody the antigenic determinant or epitope is recognized by the paratope of the antibody situated at the variable region of the polypeptide chain the variable region in turn has hyper variable regions which are unique amino acid sequences in each antibody antigens are bound to antibodies through weak and noncovalent interactions such as electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonds van der waals forces and hydrophobic interactions the principles of specificity and cross reactivity

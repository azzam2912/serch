here s is the classical action the reformulation of this transition amplitude originally due to dirac and conceptualized by feynman forms the basis of the path integral formulation the following derivation makes use of the trotter product formula which states that for self adjoint operators a and b satisfying certain technical conditions we have even if a and b do not commute we can divide the time interval into segments of length the transition amplitude can then be written although the kinetic energy and potential energy operators do not commute the trotter product formula cited above says that over each small time interval we can ignore this noncommutativity and write for notational simplicity we delay making this substitution for the moment we can insert the identity matrix we now implement the substitution associated to the trotter product formula so that we have effectively we can insert the identity into the amplitude to yield where we have used the fact that the free particle wave function is the integral over p can be performed see common integrals in quantum field theory to obtain the transition amplitude for the entire time period is if we take the limit of large the transition

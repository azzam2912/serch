this takes place through a pilus it is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell to cell contact classical e coli bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction or mating since it involves the exchange of genetic material however it is not sexual reproduction since no exchange of gamete occurs and indeed no generation of a new organism instead an existing organism is transformed during classical e coli conjugation the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the recipient cell does not already contain a similar element the genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient benefits may include antibiotic resistance xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbionts other elements however may be viewed as bacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread conjugation in escherichia coli by spontaneous zygogenesis and in mycobacterium smegmatis by distributive conjugal transfer differ from the more well studied classical e coli

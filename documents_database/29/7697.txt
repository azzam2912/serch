the coefficients of this linear combination are referred to as components or coordinates on of the vector the elements of a basis are called equivalently is a basis if its elements are linearly independent and every element of is a linear combination of elements of in more general terms a basis is a linearly independent spanning set a vector space can have several bases however all the bases have the same number of elements called the dimension of the vector space a basis of a vector space over a field such as the real numbers or the complex numbers is a linearly independent subset of that spans this means that a subset of is a basis if it satisfies the two following conditions the scalars are called the coordinates of the vector with respect to the basis and by the first property they are uniquely determined a vector space that has a finite basis is called finite dimensional in this case the subset that is considered twice in the above definition may be chosen as itself it is often convenient or even necessary to have an ordering on the basis vectors e g for discussing orientation or when one considers

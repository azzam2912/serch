rescission bills proposed by the president of the united states are considered under an expedited process that cannot be filibustered in the senate allowing it to pass with 51 votes instead of 60 the procedure was introduced in 1974 as a replacement for impoundment it was widely used between its introduction and 2000 but has not been attempted since then the rescission process is described in the process begins with the president submitting a rescission proposal to the house committee on appropriations and senate committee on appropriations each committee has 25 days to approve or disapprove the proposal if a committee takes no action the bill becomes subject to a discharge petition each house considers the bill under an expedited procedure that does not allow a filibuster in the senate the bill must be passed within 45 days after the original proposal to be enacted and the budget authority is delayed during these 45 days in practice rescission proposals have usually been incorporated into larger appropriations bills considered through the normal process rather than passed as standalone bills using the expedited process in addition to the presidential rescission procedure congress may initiate rescissions as part of a normal appropriations bill

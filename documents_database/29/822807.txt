it is not part of the c standard library or iso c nor it is defined by posix this header declares several useful library functions for performing console input and output from a program most c compilers that target dos windows 3 x phar lap dosx os 2 or win32 have this header and supply the associated library functions in the default c library most c compilers that target unix and linux do not have this header and do not supply the library functions some embedded systems or cc65 use a conio compatible library the library functions declared by conio h vary somewhat from compiler to compiler as originally implemented in lattice c the various functions mapped directly to the first few dos int 21h functions the library supplied with borland s turbo c did not use the dos api but instead accessed video ram directly for output and used bios interrupt calls this library also has additional functions inspired from the successful turbo pascal one compilers that target non dos operating systems such as linux or os 2 provide similar solutions the unix related curses library is very common here another example is syncterm s ciolib the version of

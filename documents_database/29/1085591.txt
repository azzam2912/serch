takahashi dr patrick nolan and michael hastings respectively takahashi used forward genetics n ethyl n nitrosourea enu mutagenesis to screen for mice with varied circadian activity which led to the discovery of the overtime ovtm mutant of the fbxl3 gene nolan discovered the fbxl3 mutation after hours afh by a forward screen assessing wheel activity behavior of mutagenized mice the phenotypes identified in mice were mechanistically explained by pagano who discovered that the fbxl3 protein is necessary for the reactivation of the clock and bmal1 protein heterodimer by inducing the degradation of cry proteins mice with the homozygous mutation of ovtm free run with an intrinsic period of 26 hours overtime is a loss of function mutation caused by a substitution of isoleucine to threonine in the region of fbxl3 that binds to cry in mice with this mutation levels of the proteins per1 and per2 are decreased while levels of cry proteins do not differ from those of wild type mice the stabilization of cry protein levels leads to continued repression of per1 and per2 transcription and translation the after hours mutation is a substitution of cysteine to serine at position 358 similar to overtime the mutation occurs in

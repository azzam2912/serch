syndecan 4 is one of the four vertebrate syndecans and has a molecular weight of 20 kda syndecans are the best characterized plasma membrane proteoglycans their intracellular domain of membrane spanning core protein interacts with actin cytoskeleton and signaling molecules in the cell cortex syndecans are normally found on the cell surface of fibroblasts and epithelial cells syndecans interact with fibronectin on the cell surface cytoskeletal and signaling proteins inside the cell to modulate the function of integrin in cell matrix adhesion also syndecans bind to fgfs and bring them to the fgf receptor on the same cell as a co receptor or regulator mutated certain proteoglycans could cause severe developmental defects like disordered distribution or inactivation of signaling molecules syndecans have similar structural features syndecans normally form homodimers or multimers their biological function includes cell growth regulation differentiation and adhesion syndecan 4 has more widespread distribution than other syndecans and it is the only syndecan that has been found consistently in focal adhesions syndecan 4 is also called ryudocan or amphiglycan it is found on chromosome 20 while a pseudogene has been found on chromosome 22 syndecan 4 is one of the four vertebrate syndecans and has a molecular

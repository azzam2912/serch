during endoscopic ear surgery the surgeon holds the endoscope in one hand while working in the ear with the other to allow this kind of single handed surgery different surgical instruments have to be used endoscopic visualization has improved due to high definition video imaging and wide field endoscopy and being less invasive ees is gaining importance as an adjunct to microscopic ear surgery similar to the early years of fess functional endoscopic sinus surgery ees has been controversial since early descriptions in the 1960s one of the benefits of an endoscope compared to the microscope is the wide field view of the middle ear afforded by the location of the light source at the tip of the instrument and the availability of various types of angled lenses middle ear procedures that utilize a rigid endoscope for viewing may reduce the need to drill for enhanced exposure of the operative field the traditional otologic operating microscopes typically require larger portals e g postauricular approaches to enable adequate passage of light for intraoperative viewing and follow up surveillance in the clinic one handed dissection is cited as the main drawback to ees the indications for this relatively new technique are evolving

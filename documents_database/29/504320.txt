its main role in the repair of damaged or mismatched nucleotides in dna is to create a nick in the phosphodiester backbone of the ap site created when dna glycosylase removes the damaged base there are four types of ap endonucleases that have been classified according to their mechanism and site of incision class i ap endonucleases cleave 3 to ap sites by a lyase mechanism leaving an unsaturated aldehyde termed a 3 4 hydroxy 5 phospho 2 pentenal residue and a 5 phosphate class ii ap endonucleases incise dna 5 to ap sites by a hydrolytic mechanism leaving a 3 hydroxyl and a 5 deoxyribose phosphate residue class iii and class iv ap endonucleases also cleave dna at the phosphate groups 3 and 5 to the baseless site but they generate a 3 phosphate and a 5 oh humans have two ap endonucleases ape1 and ape2 ape1 exhibits robust ap endonuclease activity which accounts for 95 of the total cellular activity and ape1 is considered to be the major ap endonuclease in human cells human ap endonuclease ape1 like most ap endonucleases is of class ii and requires an mg in its active site in order to carry out

the construction itself must satisfy a requirement of geometric invariance which may be regarded as the analog of covariance for a wider class of structures including the schemes of algebraic geometry thus the connection in a certain sense must live in a natural sheaf on a grothendieck topology in this section we discuss how to describe an ehresmann connection in sheaf theoretic terms as a grothendieck connection let m be a manifold and e m a surjective submersion so that e is a manifold fibred over m let j m e be the first order jet bundle of sections of e this may be regarded as a bundle over m or a bundle over the total space of e with the latter interpretation an ehresmann connection is a section of the bundle over e j m e e the problem is thus to obtain an intrinsic description of the sheaf of sections of this vector bundle grothendieck s solution is to consider the diagonal embedding m m m the sheaf i of ideals of in m m consists of functions on m m which vanish along the diagonal much of the infinitesimal geometry of m can be realized in terms

it was intended as a lower cost cpu for use in low end systems computer manufacturers that used these processors include packard bell compaq zeos and ibm in the early 1990s common applications did not need or benefit from an fpu among the rare exceptions were cad applications which could often simulate floating point operations in software but benefited from a hardware floating point unit immensely amd had begun manufacturing its 386dx clone which was faster than intel s to respond to this new situation intel wanted to provide a lower cost i486 cpu for system integrators but without sacrificing the better profit margins of a full i486 this was accomplished through a debug feature called disable floating point dfp by grounding a certain bond wire in the cpu package the i486sx was introduced in mid 1991 at 20 mhz in a pga package later 1992 versions of the i486sx had the fpu entirely removed for cost cutting reasons and comes in surface mount packages as well many systems allowed the user to upgrade the i486sx to a cpu with the fpu enabled the upgrade was shipped as the i487 which was a full blown i486dx chip with an extra

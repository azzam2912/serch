studenitsite has a vitreous luster a mohs hardness of 6 and color of light dirty yellow it is a monoclinic mineral and belongs to the space group p2 c the basic unit of the crystal structure bo oh 5 layers has a miller index of 001 studenitsite has a low surface relief which means the measure of the relative difference between the index of refraction of the mineral and surrounding medium is small birefringence is the difference between two principal indices of refraction of a uniaxial crystal studenitsite has a maximum birefringent value of 0 032 studenitsite has three indices of refraction their values are n 1 532 n 1 538 n 1 564 indices of refraction are the ratio of the light s speed in the mineral and the medium studenitsite is an extremely rare mineral that has only been found in the piskaya deposit yarondolskii basin on the ibar river 280 km south of belgrade serbia the deposit is classified as a volcanogenic sedimentary borate deposit with clay and carbonate minerals it occurs associated with colemanite howlite ulexite and pentahydroborite it is a rare but important mineral for understanding the volcanic settings in western serbia it was named

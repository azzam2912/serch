it is a member of the tis11 tpa induced sequence family along with butyrate response factors 1 and 2 ttp binds to au rich elements ares in the 3 untranslated regions utrs of the mrnas of some cytokines and promotes their degradation for example ttp is a component of a negative feedback loop that interferes with tnf alpha production by destabilizing its mrna mice deficient in ttp develop a complex syndrome of inflammatory diseases zfp36 has been shown to interact with 14 3 3 protein family members such as ywhah and with nup214 a member of the nuclear pore complex post transcriptionally ttp is regulated in several ways the subcellular localization of ttp is influenced by interactions with protein partners such as the 14 3 3 family of proteins these interactions and possibly interactions with target mrnas are affected by the phosphorylation state of ttp as the protein can be posttranslationally modified by a large number of protein kinases there is some evidence that the ttp transcript may also be targeted by micrornas such as mir 29a

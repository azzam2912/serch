if this memory is recorded in the genetic material and stably inherited through cell division mitosis or meiosis it is genetic memory somatic memory is limited to the organism and not passed on to subsequent generations however its mechanism may involve mitotically stable genetic memory the term applies for cellular memory animals memory and plants memory as described in the following paragraphs all cells in multicellular organisms are derived from a pluripotent zygote and contain the same genetic material with a few exceptions however they are capable of recording a history of their development within the organism leading to their specialized functions and limitations cells often employ epigenetic processes that affect dna protein interactions to record this cellular memory in the form of mitotically stable changes of the genetic material without a change in the dna sequence itself this is typically achieved via changes of the chromatin structure examples are methylation patterns of the dna molecule itself and proteins involved in packaging dna such as histones also referred to as histone code a case of somatic genetic memory is the immunological memory of the adaptive immune response in vertebrates the immune system is capable of learning to recognize pathogens and

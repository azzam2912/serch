the white browed crake type species of the defunct genus poliolimnas is now provisionally placed here the species in this genus are typically called bush hens a monotypic subtribe amaurornithina was proposed for this genus the genus amaurornis was erected by the german naturalist ludwig reichenbach in 1853 with the plain bush hen amaurornis olivacea as the type species the name comes from the greek amauros meaning dusky or brown and ornis meaning bird the new guinea flightless rail was sometimes included in this genus but more often held to constitute a distinct monotypic genus megacrex the first cladistic studies of rails based on morphology strongly suggested that amaurornis as traditionally defined is not monophyletic and that several species placed here are in fact closer to the small crakes traditionally placed in porzana this was subsequently confirmed by molecular data however these smallish species are probably not close to the large members of porzana either and would warrant re establishment of the old genus zapornia conversely the white browed crake sometimes placed in porzana too was moved to amaurornis when its alternate genus poliolimnas was abolished regardless it seems to be reasonably close to the striped crake formerly also in

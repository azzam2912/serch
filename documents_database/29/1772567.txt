csis brought about by rare genetic changes provide useful phylogenetic markers that are generally of defined size and they are flanked on both sides by conserved regions to ensure their reliability while indels can be arbitrary inserts or deletions csis are defined as only those protein indels that are present within conserved regions of the protein the csis that are restricted to a particular clade or group of species generally provide good phylogenetic markers of common evolutionary descent due to the rarity and highly specific nature of such changes it is less likely that they could arise independently by either convergent or parallel evolution i e homoplasy or synapomorphy other confounding factors such as differences in evolutionary rates at different sites or among different species also generally do not affect the interpretation of a csi by determining the presence or absence of csis in an out group species one can infer whether the ancestral form of the csi was an insert or deletion and this can be used to develop a rooted phylogenetic relationship among organisms most csis that have been identified have been found to exhibit high predictive value and they generally retain the specificity for the originally identified

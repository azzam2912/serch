they are vital to bacterial cell wall synthesis and antibiotic resistance vany is involved in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and metabolism vany d ala d ala peptidases provide resistance to the antibiotic vancomycin on some strains of enterococci and are therefore drug targets vany is a zinc dependent d dcarboxypeptidase enzyme that cleaved the c terminal residue of peptidoglycan precursors ending in r d ala d ala or r d ala d lac the substrate specificities of vanx and vany ensure that essentially only precursors with low affinity for the glycopeptide antibiotics are available for peptidoglycan synthesis in resistant strains acquired vana and vanb type glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is due to synthesis of modified peptidoglycan precursors terminating in d lactate as opposed to vana type strains which are resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin vanb type strains remain teicoplanin susceptible the vany gene was necessary for synthesis of the vancomycin inducible d d carboxypeptidase ec activity previously proposed to be responsible for glycopeptide resistance however this activity was not required for peptidoglycan synthesis in the presence of glycopeptides bacteriophage lysins ply or endolysins are phage encoded cell wall lytic enzymes which are synthesised late during virus multiplication and mediate

the gene contains 5 exons hadhb encodes a 51 2 kda protein that is composed of 133 amino acids 124 peptides have been observed through mass spectrometry data heart type fatty acid binding protein h fabp is a small cytoplasmic protein 15 kda released from cardiac myocytes following an ischemic episode like the nine other distinct fabps that have been identified h fabp is involved in active fatty acid metabolism where it transports fatty acids from the cell membrane to mitochondria for oxidation see fabp3 for biochemical details the intracellular fatty acid binding proteins fabps belongs to a multigene family fabps are divided into at least three distinct types namely the hepatic intestinal and cardiac type they form 14 15 kda proteins and are thought to participate in the uptake intracellular metabolism and or transport of long chain fatty acids they may also be responsible in the modulation of cell growth and proliferation fatty acid binding protein 3 gene contains four exons and its function is to arrest growth of mammary epithelial cells this gene is also a candidate tumor suppressor gene for human breast cancer fabp3 is known to interact with tnni3k in the context of interacting with cardiac

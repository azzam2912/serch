exposed unprotected steel will corrode much more rapidly than steel covered with this protective layer many ships also use sacrificial anodes or an impressed current for additional protection empty ballast tanks will corrode faster than areas fully immersed due to the thin and electo conducting moisture film covering them the main factors influencing the rate of corrosion are diffusion temperature conductivity type of ions ph and electrochemical corrosion potential ballast tanks do not corrode uniformly throughout the tank each region behaves distinctively according to it electrochemical loading the differences can especially be seen in empty ballast tanks the upper sections usually corrode but the lower sections will blister a ballast tank has three distinct sections 1 upper 2 mid or boottop area and 3 the double bottom or lower wing sections the upper regions are constantly affected by weather this area experiences a high degree of thermal cycling and mechanical damage through vibration this area tends to undergo anodic oxidation more rapidly than other sections and will weaken more rapidly this ullage or headspace area contains more oxygen and thus speeds atmospheric corrosion as evidenced by the appearance of rust scales in the midsection corrodes more slowly than upper or

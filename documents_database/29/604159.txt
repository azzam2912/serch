introduced in june 1988 it was the second mips implementation succeeding the r2000 as the flagship mips microprocessor it operated at 20 25 and 33 33 mhz the mips 1 instruction set is small compared to those of the contemporary 80x86 and 680x0 architectures encoding only more commonly used operations and supporting few addressing modes combined with its fixed instruction length and only three different types of instruction formats this simplified instruction decoding and processing it employed a 5 stage instruction pipeline enabling execution at a rate approaching one instruction per cycle unusual for its time this mips generation supports up to four co processors in addition to the cpu core the r3000 microprocessor includes a control processor cp which contains a translation lookaside buffer and a memory management unit the cp works as a coprocessor besides the cp the r3000 can also support an external r3010 numeric coprocessor and two other external coprocessors the r3000 cpu does not include level 1 cache instead its on chip cache controller operates external data and instruction caches of up to 256 kb each it can access both caches during the same clock cycle the r3000 found much success and was used by

it is a nonparametric test that tests the null hypothesis that the medians of the populations from which two or more samples are drawn are identical the data in each sample are assigned to two groups one consisting of data whose values are higher than the median value in the two groups combined and the other consisting of data whose values are at the median or below a pearson s chi squared test is then used to determine whether the observed frequencies in each sample differ from expected frequencies derived from a distribution combining the two groups the test has low power efficiency for moderate to large sample sizes the wilcoxon mann whitney u two sample test or its generalisation for more samples the kruskal wallis test can often be considered instead the relevant aspect of the median test is that it only considers the position of each observation relative to the overall median whereas the wilcoxon mann whitney test takes the ranks of each observation into account thus the other mentioned tests are usually more powerful than the median test moreover the median test can only be used for quantitative data it is crucial to note however that the

phospholipase a1 is an enzyme that resides in a class of enzymes called phospholipase that hydrolyze phospholipids into fatty acids there are 4 classes which are separated by the type of reaction they catalyze in particular phospholipase a1 pla1 specifically catalyzes the cleavage at the sn 1 position of phospholipids forming a fatty acid and a lysophospholipid pla1 s are present in numerous species including humans and have a variety of cellular functions that include regulation and facilitation of the production of lysophospholipid mediators and acting as digestive enzymes these enzymes are responsible for fast turnover rates of cellular phospholipids in addition to this the products of the reaction catalyzed by pla1 which are a fatty acid and a lysophospholipid are important in various biological functions such as platelet aggregation and smooth muscle contraction in addition lysophospholipids can be found as surfactants in food techniques and cosmetics and can be used in drug delivery since pla1 is found in many species it has been found that there are different classes of this one specific enzyme based on the organism being studied there are many variations of pla1 differing slightly between each organism it is present in most notably it can

michael ross is a result in computational optimal control based on generating carath odory solutions for feedback control ross lemma states that there is fundamental time constant within which a control solution must be computed for controllability and stability this time constant known as ross time constant is proportional to the inverse of the lipschitz constant of the vector field that governs the dynamics of a nonlinear control system the proportionality factor in the definition of ross time constant is dependent upon the magnitude of the disturbance on the plant and the specifications for feedback control when there are no disturbances ross lemma shows that the open loop optimal solution is the same as the closed loop one in the presence of disturbances the proportionality factor can be written in terms of the lambert w function in practical applications ross time constant can be found by numerical experimentation using dido ross et al showed that this time constant is connected to the practical implementation of a caratheodory solution that is ross et al showed that if feedback solutions are obtained by zero order holds only then a significantly faster sampling rate is needed to achieve controllability and stability on the

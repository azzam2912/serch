the diagram consists of a set of nodes and edges nodes represent the variables and edges are the links that represent a connection or a relation between the two variables a link marked positive indicates a positive relation and a link marked negative indicates a negative relation a positive causal link means the two nodes change in the same direction i e if the node in which the link starts decreases the other node also decreases similarly if the node in which the link starts increases the other node increases as well a negative causal link means the two nodes change in opposite directions i e if the node in which the link starts increases the other node decreases and vice versa closed cycles in the diagram are very important features of the clds a closed cycle is either defined as a reinforcing or balancing feedback loop a reinforcing loop is a cycle in which the effect of a variation in any variable propagates through the loop and returns to the variable reinforcing the initial deviation i e if a variable increases in a reinforcing loop the effect through the cycle will return an increase to the same variable and

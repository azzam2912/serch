the continuous problem is broken into formula 1 discrete intervals quadrature or numerical integration determines the weights and locations of representative points for the integral the problem becomes a system of linear equations with formula 1 equations and formula 1 unknowns and the underlying function is implicitly represented by an interpolation using the chosen quadrature rule this discrete problem may be ill conditioned depending on the original problem and the chosen quadrature rule since the linear equations require formula 4 operations to solve high order quadrature rules perform better because low order quadrature rules require large formula 1 for a given accuracy gaussian quadrature is normally a good choice for smooth non singular problems standard quadrature methods seek to represent an integral as a weighed sum in the following manner where formula 7 are the weights of the quadrature rule and points formula 8 are the abscissas applying this to the inhomogeneous fredholm equation of the second kind results in the most important step of the nystr m method is sampling because different sampled landmark points give different approximations of the original matrix uniform sampling without replacement is the most used approach for this purpose where every point has the

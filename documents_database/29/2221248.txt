the c band 4 to 8 ghz is used for many satellite communications transmissions some wi fi devices some cordless telephones as well as some surveillance and weather radar systems the communications c band was the first frequency band that was allocated for commercial telecommunications via satellites the same frequencies were already in use for terrestrial microwave radio relay chains nearly all c band communication satellites use the band of frequencies from 3 7 to 4 2 ghz for their downlinks and the band of frequencies from 5 925 to 6 425 ghz for their uplinks note that by using the band from 3 7 to 4 0 ghz this c band overlaps somewhat into the ieee s band for radars the c band communication satellites typically have 24 radio transponders spaced 20 mhz apart but with the adjacent transponders on opposite polarizations in that configuration the transponders on the same polarization are always 40 mhz apart of this 40 mhz each transponder utilizes about 36 mhz the unused 4 0 mhz between the pairs of transponders acts as guard bands for the likely case of imperfections in the microwave electronics one use of the c band is for satellite

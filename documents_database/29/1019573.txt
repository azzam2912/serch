the rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star or by timing the movements of active features on the surface the rotation of a star produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force as stars are not solid bodies they can also undergo differential rotation thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes these differences in the rate of rotation within a star may have a significant role in the generation of a stellar magnetic field the magnetic field of a star interacts with the stellar wind as the wind moves away from the star its rate of angular velocity slows the magnetic field of the star interacts with the wind which applies a drag to the stellar rotation as a result angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind and over time this gradually slows the star s rate of rotation unless a star is being observed from the direction of its pole sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer the component of movement that is in the direction of the observer is called the radial

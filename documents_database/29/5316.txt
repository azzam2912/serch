glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word or contribute to a specific meaning of what is written with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage in most languages written in any variety of the latin alphabet the dot on a lower case i is not a glyph because it does not convey any distinction and an i in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognized correctly however in turkish it is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter i with and without a dot also in japanese syllabaries a number of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves however in some cases additional marks fulfill the role of diacritics to differentiate distinct characters such additional marks constitute glyphs in general a diacritic is a glyph even if it is contiguous with the rest of the character like a cedilla in french the ogonek in several languages or the stroke on a polish some characters such as in icelandic

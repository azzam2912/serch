a function need not have a least fixed point and cannot have more than one for example with the usual order on the real numbers the least fixed point of the real function f x x is x 0 since the only other fixed point is 1 and 0 fixed point theorems yield algorithms for locating the least fixed point least fixed points often have desirable properties that arbitrary fixed points do not in mathematical logic and computer science the least fixed point is related to making recursive definitions see domain theory and or denotational semantics for details immerman and vardi independently showed the descriptive complexity result that the polynomial time computable properties of linearly ordered structures are definable in fo lfp i e in first order logic with a least fixed point operator however fo lfp is too weak to express all polynomial time properties of unordered structures for instance that a structure has even size let g v a be a directed graph and v be a vertex the set of nodes accessible from v can be defined as the set s which is the least fixed point for the property v belongs to s and if w

otherwise the expression is said to be not well defined ill defined or ambiguous a function is well defined if it gives the same result when the representation of the input is changed without changing the value of the input for instance if f takes real numbers as input and if f 0 5 does not equal f 1 2 then f is not well defined and thus not a function the term well defined can also used to indicate that a logical expression is unambiguous or uncontradictory a function that is not well defined is not the same as a function that is undefined for example if f x 1 x then the fact that f 0 is undefined does not mean that the f is not well defined but that 0 is simply not in the domain of f let formula 1 be sets let formula 2 and define formula 3 as formula 4 if formula 5 and formula 6 if formula 7 then formula 8 is well defined if formula 9 for example if formula 10and formula 11 then formula 12would be well defined and equal to formula 13 however if formula 14 then formula 8 would

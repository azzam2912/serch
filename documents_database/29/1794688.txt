the epicenter was located in the northern izu peninsula japan it had a magnitude of 7 3 the earthquake was caused by the movement of the tanna fault the izu peninsula is located in the northern tip of the philippine sea plate however the gps vectors of the izu peninsula are almost westwards which are different from the northwestward motion of the philippine sea plate a seismically active area in the east off the izu peninsula might be the deformation zone between the izu peninsula and the main part of the philippine sea plate or at times be regarded as the boundary between the izu microplate and the philippine sea plate the suspected boundary might be rather a complex fracture zone than a simple boundary in this view the izu microplate is pushed northwestwards by the philippine sea plate and rotates clockwise pivoting on the base of the izu peninsula the rotation causes an almost westward motion under the suruga bay the interplate coupling under the sugura bay is not weak the tanna fault is part of the north izu fault zone or kita izu fault zone the north izu fault zone is about long lying in the nne ssw

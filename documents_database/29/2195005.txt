the company provides a full stack software as a service platform called nervana cloud that enables businesses to develop custom deep learning software on august 9 2016 it was acquired by intel for an estimated 408 million the company s now discontinued open source deep learning framework is called neon neon which the company says outperforms rival frameworks such as caffe theano torch and tensorflow achieves its performance advantage through assembler level optimization multi gpu support and use of an algorithm called winograd for computing convolutions which are common mathematical operations in the deep learning process nervana cloud announced in february 2016 is based on neon and runs on nvidia titan x gpus today but nervana is developing a custom application specific integrated circuit asic called the nervana engine that is optimized for deep learning and that nervana says will perform 10x better than nvidia maxwell architecture gpus the nervana engine will achieve greater compute density by implementing only those design elements that are necessary to support deep learning algorithms and ignoring legacy elements specific to graphics processing nervana was founded in 2014 by ceo naveen rao cto amir khosrowshahi dara khosrowshahi s cousin and vp algorithms arjun bansal nervana

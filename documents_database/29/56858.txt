there is currently no generally accepted globally consistent definition of exactly what constitutes a metropolitan area thus making comparisons between cities in different countries especially difficult however for consistency the sources on this article include official figures from governments only as an alternative to the metropolitan area eurostat introduced the concept of the larger urban zone in 2004 similarly oecd defines functional urban areas for cities in oecd countries both larger urban zone and functional urban area define a city as an urban core surrounded by a commuting zone and so are similar to the general concept of the metropolitan area eurostat only computes larger urban zone populations for european union member states candidate members and european free trade area members oecd computes functional urban area populations for oecd member states these two statistics are therefore not available for most developing countries note due to a lack of accurate governmental data this list is incomplete metropolitan country continent official population year

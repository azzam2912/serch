this can be quantified simply as a measure of time or it may entail a host of other criteria involving other evidence of functionality or fitness for purpose the following depict the most commonly used international time temperature curves there are many international variations for nearly countless types of products and systems some with multiple test requirements canada s institute for research in construction a part of the national research council and publisher of canada s model building code nbc requires a special test regime for firestops for plastic pipe penetrants fire endurance tests for this application must be run under 50pa positive furnace pressure in order to adequately simulate the effect of potential temperature differences between indoor and outdoor temperatures in canada s winters special hoods are applied here to provide suction on the top side of a test assembly in order to reach the 50pa pressure differential afterwards a 30psi hose stream test may be applied outdoor spray fireproofing methods that must be qualified to the hydrocarbon curve may be required to pass a host of environmental tests before any burn takes place to minimize the likelihood that ordinary operational environments cannot render a vital system component useless

it is yellowish grey the shell contains 11 whorls of which about 3 form a convexly whorled protoconch with the common criss cross lines the subsequent whorls are slightly convex separated by a linear indistinct suture bordered by a narrow excavation the sculpture consists of rounded ribs on a little more than 4 following whorls disappearing on lower whorls they are all crossed by spiral lirae 9 in number on penultimate whorl of which one borders the suture another the excavation about 30 on the body whorl and the siphonal canal besides a few intermediate ones on this body whorl scarcely appreciable on the upper ones these lirae produce a cancellation on the upper 4 post nuclear whorls hence the name moreover there are numerous finer spiral lines between the principal ones making the whole shell spirally striated crossed by more or less conspicuous growth striae strongly incised at intervals closer on last part of the body whorl making the principal lirae nearly beaded the aperture is oblong narrow above at the rather deep sinus and below al the siphonal canal the perisotme is rather strong much contracted at the limit of the siphonal canal interiorly with short grooves corresponding

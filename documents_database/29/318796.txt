this type of power plant is sometimes called a trash to energy municipal waste incineration energy recovery or resource recovery plant modern waste to energy plants are very different from the trash incinerators that were commonly used until a few decades ago unlike modern ones those plants usually did not remove hazardous or recyclable materials before burning these incinerators endangered the health of the plant workers and the nearby residents and most of them did not generate electricity waste to energy generation is being increasingly looked at as a potential energy diversification strategy especially by sweden which has been a leader in waste to energy production over the past 20 years the typical range of net electrical energy that can be produced is about 500 to 600 kwh of electricity per ton of waste incinerated thus the incineration of about 2 200 tons per day of waste will produce about 1200 mwh of electrical energy most waste to energy plants burn municipal solid waste but some burn industrial waste or hazardous waste a modern properly run waste to energy plant sorts material before burning it and can co exist with recycling the only items that are burned are not recyclable

it supports approximately 50 file formats for some 25 instruction set architectures when david henkel wallace of cygnus support proposed developing the library as a way to open up new business opportunities for the company richard stallman said that it would be difficult david s response was that it wasn t such a big fucking deal abbreviated to bfd this became the library name binary file descriptor was invented later as a backronym for bfd bfd works by presenting a common abstract view of object files an object file has a header with descriptive info a variable number of sections that each has a name some attributes and a block of data a symbol table relocation entries and so forth internally bfd translates the data from the abstract view into the details of the bit byte layout required by the target processor and file format its key services include handling byte order differences such as between a little endian host and big endian target correct conversion between 32 bit and 64 bit data and details of address arithmetic specified by relocation entries although bfd was originally designed to be a generic library usable by a wide variety of tools the

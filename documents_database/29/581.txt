the proteins may be separated by charge and or size isoelectric focusing agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent and the dna and rna fragments by length biomolecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the charged molecules through an agarose matrix and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrix agarose gel is easy to cast has relatively fewer charged groups and is particularly suitable for separating dna of size range most often encountered in laboratories which accounts for the popularity of its use the separated dna may be viewed with stain most commonly under uv light and the dna fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease most agarose gels used are between 0 7 2 dissolved in a suitable electrophoresis buffer agarose gel is a three dimensional matrix formed of helical agarose molecules in supercoiled bundles that are aggregated into three dimensional structures with channels and pores through which biomolecules can pass the 3 d structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can therefore be disrupted by heating back to a liquid state the melting temperature is different from the gelling temperature depending on the sources agarose gel has a

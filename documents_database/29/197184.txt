the macula densa is the thickening where the distal tubule touches the glomerulus the cells of the macula densa are sensitive to the concentration of sodium chloride in the distal convoluted tubule a decrease in sodium chloride concentration initiates a signal from the macula densa that has two effects 1 it decreases resistance to blood flow in the afferent arterioles which raises glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helps return the glomerular filtration rate gfr toward normal and 2 it increases renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles which are the major storage sites for renin as such an increase in sodium chloride concentration would result in vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles and reduced paracrine stimulation of juxtaglomerular cells this demonstrates the macula densa feedback where compensatory mechanisms act in order to return gfr to normal the release of renin is an essential component of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system raas which regulates blood pressure and volume the cells of the macula densa are taller and have more prominent nuclei than surrounding cells of the distal straight tubule cortical thick ascending limb the close proximity and prominence of the nuclei cause this segment of the distal tubule wall

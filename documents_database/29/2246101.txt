developed the governing equations for multiphase flow one vector equation for each fluid phase in porous media as a generalisation of darcy s equation or darcy s law for water flow in porous media the porous media are usually sedimentary rocks such as clastic rocks mostly sandstone or carbonate rocks the present fluid phases are water oil and gas and they are represented by the subscript a w o g respectively the gravitational acceleration with direction is represented as formula 2 or formula 3 or formula 4 notice that in petroleum engineering the spatial co ordinate system is right hand oriented with z axis pointing downward the physical property that links the flow equations of the three fluid phases is relative permeability of each fluid phase and pressure this property of the fluid rock system i e water oil gas rock system is mainly a function of the fluid saturations and it is linked to capillary pressure and the flowing process implying that it is subject to hysteresis effect in 1940 m c leverett pointed out that in order to include capillary pressure effects in the flow equation the pressure must be phase dependent the flow equation then becomes leverett

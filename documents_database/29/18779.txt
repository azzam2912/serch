the stratosphere is stratified layered in temperature with warmer layers higher and cooler layers closer to the earth this increase of temperature with altitude is a result of the absorption of the sun s ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer this is in contrast to the troposphere near the earth s surface where temperature decreases with altitude the border between the troposphere and stratosphere the tropopause marks where this temperature inversion begins near the equator the stratosphere starts at as high as around at midlatitudes and at about at the poles temperatures range from an average of near the tropopause to an average of near the mesosphere stratospheric temperatures also vary within the stratosphere as the seasons change reaching particularly low temperatures in the polar night winter winds in the stratosphere can far exceed those in the troposphere reaching near in the southern polar vortex the mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by british mathematician sydney chapman in 1930 molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the uv c region at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone ozone in turn is

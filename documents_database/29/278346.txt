by definition cycles are excluded so that the silenes comprise homologous series of inorganic compounds with the general formula k 0 where k is defined as the number of double bonds there are no commercial sources each silicon atom has three or four bonds either si h si si or si si and each hydrogen atom is joined to a silicon atom h si bonds a series of linked silicon atoms is known as the silicon skeleton or silicon backbone the number of silicon atoms is used to define the size of the silene e g si silene a silenyl group is a functional group or side chain with the general formula k 0 where k is defined as the number of double bonds for example an disilenyl or trisil 1 en 1 yl group the simplest silene is the parent molecule is disilene there is no limit to the number of silicon atoms that can be linked together the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic is unsaturated and is a hydrosilicon for bridged silenes the bredt s rule states that a double bond cannot be placed at the bridgehead of a bridged ring system unless the rings

this type of myotonia has been termed paradoxical because it becomes worse with exercise whereas classical myotonia as seen in myotonia congenita is alleviated by exercise pc is also distinguished as it can be induced by cold temperatures although more typical of the periodic paralytic disorders patients with pc may also have potassium provoked paralysis pc typically presents within the first decade of life and has 100 penetrance patients with this disorder commonly present with myotonia in the face or upper extremities the lower extremities are generally less affected while some other related disorders result in muscle atrophy this is not normally the case with pc this disease can also present as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and there is debate as to whether the two disorders are actually distinct patients typically complain of muscle stiffness that can continue to focal weakness this muscle stiffness cannot be walked off in contrast to myotonia congenita these symptoms are increased and sometimes induced in cold environments for example some patients have reported that eating ice cream leads to a stiffening of the throat for other patients exercise consistently induces symptoms of myotonia or weakness typical presentations of this are during squatting or repetitive fist

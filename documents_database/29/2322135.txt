horizontal gene transfer is universal in fungi viruses bacteria and other eukaryotes horizontal gene transfer research often focuses on prokaryotes because of the abundant sequence data from diverse lineages and because it is assumed not to play a significant role in eukaryotes most plant fungus horizontal gene transfer events are ancient and rare but they may have provided important gene functions leading to wider substrate use and habitat spread for plants and fungi since these events are rare and ancient they have been difficult to detect and remain relatively unknown plant fungus interactions could play a part in a multi horizontal gene transfer pathway among many other organisms fungus plant mediated horizontal gene transfer can occur via phagotrophic mechanisms mediated by phagotrophic eukaryotes and nonphagotropic mechanisms nonphagotrophic mechanisms have been seen in the transmission of transposable elements plastid derived endosymbiotic gene transfer prokaryote derived gene transfer agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated dna transfer cross species hybridization events and gene transfer between mitochondrial genes horizontal gene transfer could bypass eukaryotic barrier features like linear chromatin based chromosomes intron exon gene structures and the nuclear envelope horizontal gene transfer occurs between microorganisms sharing overlapping ecological niches and associations like parasitism or symbiosis ecological association

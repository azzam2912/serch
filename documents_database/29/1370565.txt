the ejc has major influences on translation surveillance and localization of the spliced mrna it is first deposited onto mrna during splicing and is then transported into the cytoplasm there it plays a major role in post transcriptional regulation of mrna it is believed that exon junction complexes provide a position specific memory of the splicing event the ejc consists of a stable heterotetramer core which serves as a binding platform for other factors necessary for the mrna pathway the core of the ejc contains the protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4a iii eif4a iii a dead box rna helicase bound to an adenosine triphosphate atp analog as well as the additional proteins magoh and y14 the binding of these proteins to nuclear speckled domains has been measured recently and it may be regulated by pi3k akt mtor signaling pathways in order for the binding of the complex to the mrna to occur the eif4aiii factor is inhibited stopping the hydrolysis of atp this recognizes ejc as an atp dependent complex ejc also interacts with a large number of additional proteins most notably sr proteins these interactions are suggested to be important for mrna compaction the role of ejc in mrna

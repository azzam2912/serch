it enabled ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving very low frequency vlf radio signals in the range 10 to 14 khz transmitted by a network of fixed terrestrial radio beacons using a receiver unit it became operational around 1971 and was shut down in 1997 in favour of the global positioning system taking a fix in any navigation system requires the determination of two measurements typically these are taken in relation to fixed objects like prominent landmarks or the known location of radio transmission towers by measuring the angle to two such locations the position of the navigator can be determined alternately one can measure the angle and distance to a single object or the distance to two objects the introduction of radio systems during the 20th century dramatically increased the distances over which measurements could be taken such a system also demanded much greater accuracies in the measurements an error of one degree in angle might be acceptable when taking a fix on a lighthouse a few miles away but would be of limited use when used on a radio station away a variety of methods were developed to take fixes with relatively small angle inaccuracies

the source node is known as the root the destination nodes are known as leaves in the modern era it is important to protect multicast connections in an optical mesh network recently multicast applications have gained popularity as they are important to protecting critical sessions against failures such as fiber cuts hardware faults and natural disasters multicast applications include multimedia medical imaging digital audio hdtv video conferencing interactive distance learning and distributed games in order to support multi casting the wdm network requires multicast capable wavelength routing switches at the network node these switches are capable of replicating data streams from one input port to multiple output ports there are two types of switch architectures that are usually used multicast lightpaths protection refers to an immediate response of the network after a failure to switch the traffic on another path dedicated resources along the backup paths are dedicated for only one connection and are not shared with the backup paths for other connections shared resources along a backup path may be shared with other backup paths for other connections several protection schemes have been proposed in the literature to protect the multicast connections the simplest idea to protect the multicast

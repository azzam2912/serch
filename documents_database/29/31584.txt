there are two subfamilies silphinae and nicrophorinae nicrophorines are sometimes known as sexton beetles the number of species is relatively small and around two hundred they are more diverse in the temperate region although a few tropical endemics are known both subfamilies feed on decaying organic matter such as dead animals the subfamilies differ in which uses parental care and which types of carcasses they prefer silphidae are considered to be of importance to forensic entomologists because when they are found on a decaying body they are used to help estimate a post mortem interval the family silphidae belongs to the order coleoptera they are commonly referred to as carrion beetles or burying beetles and are usually associated with carrion fungi and dung in the past members of the family agyrtidae were included this family has two subfamilies silphinae and nicrophorinae the antenna is made up of 11 segments and is capitate ending in an abruptly capped club in the nicrophorinae and has a more gradual club shape in the silphinae the subfamilies also differ in behavior members of the subfamily silphinae show little to no care for their young and breed on large carrion nicrophorinae breed on small animal

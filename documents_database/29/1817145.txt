the basic cause of sporadic non familial cancers is dna damage and genomic instability a minority of cancers are due to inherited genetic mutations most cancers are related to environmental lifestyle or behavioral exposures cancer is generally not contagious in humans though it can be caused by oncoviruses and cancer bacteria the term environmental as used by cancer researchers refers to everything outside the body that interacts with humans the environment is not limited to the biophysical environment e g exposure to factors such as air pollution or sunlight but also includes lifestyle and behavioral factors over one third of cancer deaths worldwide and about 75 80 in the united states are potentially avoidable by reducing exposure to known factors common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include exposure to different chemical and physical agents tobacco use accounts for 25 30 of cancer deaths environmental pollutants diet and obesity 30 35 infections 15 20 and radiation both ionizing and non ionizing up to 10 these factors act at least partly by altering the function of genes within cells typically many such genetic changes are required before cancer develops aging has been repeatedly and consistently regarded as an important aspect

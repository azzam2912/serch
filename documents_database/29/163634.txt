the transform was introduced in 1917 by johann radon who also provided a formula for the inverse transform radon further included formulas for the transform in three dimensions in which the integral is taken over planes integrating over lines is known as the x ray transform it was later generalized to higher dimensional euclidean spaces and more broadly in the context of integral geometry the complex analog of the radon transform is known as the penrose transform the radon transform is widely applicable to tomography the creation of an image from the projection data associated with cross sectional scans of an object if a function formula 1 represents an unknown density then the radon transform represents the projection data obtained as the output of a tomographic scan hence the inverse of the radon transform can be used to reconstruct the original density from the projection data and thus it forms the mathematical underpinning for tomographic reconstruction also known as iterative reconstruction the radon transform data is often called a sinogram because the radon transform of an off center point source is a sinusoid consequently the radon transform of a number of small objects appears graphically as a number of blurred

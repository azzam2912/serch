if there exists an isomorphism between two groups then the groups are called isomorphic from the standpoint of group theory isomorphic groups have the same properties and need not be distinguished given two groups g and h formula 1 a group isomorphism from g to h formula 1 is a bijective group homomorphism from g to h spelled out this means that a group isomorphism is a bijective function formula 3 such that for all u and v in g it holds that the two groups g and h formula 1 are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism from one to the other this is written often shorter and simpler notations can be used when the relevant group operations are unambiguous they are omitted and one writes sometimes one can even simply write g h whether such a notation is possible without confusion or ambiguity depends on context for example the equals sign is not very suitable when the groups are both subgroups of the same group see also the examples conversely given a group g a set h and a bijection formula 3 we can make h a group h formula 1 by defining if h g and formula

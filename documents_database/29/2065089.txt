it was discovered by william parsons 3rd earl of rosse lord rosse sometime before 1850 ngc 3198 is located in the leo spur which is part of the virgo supercluster and is approximately 47 million light years away two supernovae have been discovered in ngc 3198 sn 1966j a type ib supernova and 1999bw which was significantly fainter than expected when first discovered and has been classified a type iin supernova observations made with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope detected for the first time the presence of extraplanar gas the extraplanar gas makes up approximately 15 of the total atomic hydrogen hi mass of the galaxy ngc 3198 was one of 18 galaxies targeted by the hubble space telescope hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale which aimed to calibrate various secondary distance indicators and determine the hubble constant to an accuracy of 10 the type and orientation of ngc 3198 made it suitable for these measurements the wide field and planetary camera 2 wfpc2 of the hst was used to measure the magnitudes of 52 cepheid variables and the resulting distance modulus corresponded to a distance of 14 5 mpc 47 million light years

this process is widely associated with the development of new bio based associated by products the milling process separates the grain into four distinct physical components the germ flour fine grits and coarse grits the separated materials are then reduced into food products utilized for human and animal consumption it is estimated that 165 million bushels of corn are dry milled per year currently dry milling is mainly focused on corn based products for human and animal consumption or utilized during fuel ethanol production the main objective of the dry milling process is to separate the endosperm which is mainly composed of starch from the germ and pericarp fibers as much as possible the dry milling process includes a number of unique features the most utilized grinding mills include pin hammer and disk mills but many machines are utilized for more specific processes to maintain a high starch extraction the grains will go through a degermination process this process removes the germ and fiber pericarp first and the endosperm is recovered in several sizes grits cones meal and flow it is important to note that the gluten protein matrix is not separated from the starch the table below is a

many of the salts containing phosphirenium ions have been isolated and characterized by nmr spectroscopy and x ray crystallography the first series of phosphirenium ions were synthesized by reacting alkynes with methyl or phenylphosphonous dichloride and aluminum trichloride these reactions may be regarded as formal addition of rclp to alkynes 2 1 cycloaddition reactions between phosphaalkynes and chlorocarbene give phosphirenes which serve as starting materials for the generation of phosphirenium species treatment of diphenylphosphine oxide with diphenylacetylene affords phosphirenium species phosphirenium ions can also be obtained from reaction between phosphiranes and alkynes where rclp is formally transferred from alkenes to alkynes in the literature p nmr spectra of phosphirenium ions show upfield shifts 57 3 ppm when r r y ch y cl large coupling constants j are also found in h nmr and are comparable to those found in cyclopropenium ions the first phosphirenium ion characterized by x ray crystallography has the following structural formula in the refined crystal structure average phosphorus cyclic carbon distance has been found to be 1 731 12 roughly corresponding to a bond order of 1 5 for comparison typical single and double bond p c distances are 1 86 and 1 68 respectively

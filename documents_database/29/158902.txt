adherents of the church called themselves simply krstjani christians or dobri bo njani good bosnians the church s organization and beliefs are poorly understood because few if any records were left by church members and the church is mostly known from the writings of outside sources primarily roman catholic ones the monumental tombstones called ste ak that appeared in medieval bosnia and herzegovina as well croatia serbia and montenegro are sometime identified with the bosnian church christian missions emanating from rome and constantinople started pushing into the balkans in the 9th century christianizing the south slavs and establishing boundaries between the ecclesiastical jurisdictions of the see of rome and the see of constantinople the east west schism then led to the establishment of roman catholicism in croatia and most of dalmatia while eastern orthodoxy came to prevail in serbia lying in between the mountainous bosnia was nominally under rome but catholicism never became firmly established due to a weak church organization and poor communications medieval bosnia thus remained a no man s land between faiths rather than a meeting ground between the two churches leading to a unique religious history and the emergence of an independent and somewhat heretical church

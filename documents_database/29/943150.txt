random measures are for example used in the theory of random processes where they form many important point processes such as poisson point processes and cox processes random measures can be defined as transition kernels or as random elements both definitions are equivalent for the definitions let formula 1 be a separable complete metric space and let formula 2 be its borel formula 3 algebra the most common example of a separable complete metric space is formula 4 a random measure formula 5 is a a s locally finite transition kernel from a abstract probability space formula 6 to formula 7 being a transition kernel means that being locally finite means that the measures satisfy formula 16 for all bounded measurable sets formula 17 and for all formula 12 except some formula 19 null set define and the subset of locally finite measures by for all bounded measurable formula 22 define the mappings from formula 24 to formula 25 let formula 26 be the formula 3 algebra induced by the mappings formula 28 on formula 24 and formula 30 the formula 3 algebra induced by the mappings formula 28 on formula 33 note that formula 34 a random measure is

each base edge and apex form a triangle called a lateral face it is a conic solid with polygonal base a pyramid with an n sided base has vertices faces and 2 n edges all pyramids are self dual a right pyramid has its apex directly above the centroid of its base nonright pyramids are called oblique pyramids a regular pyramid has a regular polygon base and is usually implied to be a right pyramid when unspecified a pyramid is usually assumed to be a regular square pyramid like the physical pyramid structures a triangle based pyramid is more often called a tetrahedron among oblique pyramids like acute and obtuse triangles a pyramid can be called acute if its apex is above the interior of the base and obtuse if its apex is above the exterior of the base a right angled pyramid has its apex above an edge or vertex of the base in a tetrahedron these qualifiers change based on which face is considered the base pyramids are a class of the prismatoids pyramids can be doubled into bipyramids by adding a second offset point on the other side of the base plane a right pyramid with a

this causes an effect analogous to a sonic boom during seismic events along a fault surface the displacement initiates at the focus and then propagates outwards typically for large earthquakes the focus lies towards one end of the slip surface and much of the propagation is unidirectional e g the 2008 sichuan and 2004 indian ocean earthquakes theoretical studies have in the past suggested that the upper bound for propagation velocity is that of rayleigh waves approximately 0 92 of the shear wave velocity however evidence of propagation at velocities between s wave and compressional wave p wave values have been reported for several earthquakes in agreement with theoretical and laboratory studies that support the possibility of rupture propagation in this velocity range evidence of rupture propagation at velocities greater than s wave velocities expected for the surrounding crust have been observed for several large earthquakes associated with strike slip faults during strike slip the main component of rupture propagation will be horizontal in the direction of displacement as a mode ii in plane shear crack this contrasts with a dip slip rupture where the main direction of rupture propagation will be perpendicular to the displacement like a mode iii

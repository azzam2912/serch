depending on the relationship such groups can be heterotopic homotopic enantiotopic or diastereotopic homotopic groups in a chemical compound are equivalent groups two groups a and b are homotopic if the molecule remains the same including stereochemically when the groups are interchanged with some other atom such as bromine the remaining parts of the molecule fixed homotopic atoms are always identical in any environment homotopic nmr active nuclei have the same chemical shift in an nmr spectrum for example the four hydrogen atoms of methane ch are homotopic with one another as are the two hydrogens or the two chlorines in dichloromethane chcl the stereochemical term enantiotopic refers to the relationship between two groups in a molecule which if one or the other were replaced would generate a chiral compound the two possible compounds resulting from that replacement would be enantiomers for example the two hydrogen atoms attached to the second carbon in butane are enantiotopic replacement of one hydrogen atom colored blue with a bromine atom will produce r 2 bromobutane replacement of the other hydrogen atom colored red with a bromine atom will produce the enantiomer s 2 bromobutane enantiotopic groups are identical and indistinguishable except in chiral

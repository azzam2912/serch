the ote consists of some major parts of the telescopes including the main mirror the secondary mirrors the framework and controls to support those mirrors and various thermal and other systems to support the functioning of the telescope the other two major sections of the jwst are the integrated science instrument module holds instruments and the spacecraft element se which includes the spacecraft bus and sunshield the ote collects the light and sends it to the science instruments in the isim the ote has been compared to being the eye of the telescope and the backplane of it to being the spine the primary mirror is a tiled assembly of 18 hexagonal elements each 1 32 meters from flat to flat this combination yields an effective aperture of 6 5 meters and a total collecting surface of 27 square meters secondary mirrors complete the 20 anastigmatic imaging optics the complete system provides an effective number of 16 67 and focal length of 131 4 meters the main three mirror telescope is a korsch type design and it feeds into the aft optics subsystem part of ote which in turn feeds into the integrated science instrument module which holds the science

mccauley and others have proposed the name caloris group to include the mappable units created by the impact that formed the caloris basin and have formally named four formations within the group which were first recognized and named informally by trask and guest like the imbrium and orientale basins on the moon caloris basin is surrounded by an extensive and well preserved ejecta blanket as on the moon where ejecta from the better preserved basins was used to construct a stratigraphy the ejecta from the caloris basin also can be used as a marker horizon this ejecta is recognizable to a distance of about one basin diameter in the tolstoj quadrangle and the adjacent shakespeare quadrangle to the north undoubtedly the ejecta also influences a large part of the terrain to the west that was recently photographed by messenger a stratigraphic and structural comparison between the orientale and caloris basins has been made by mccauley mccauley and others have proposed a formal rock stratigraphy for the caloris basin that we have adopted on the present map this stratigraphy is patterned after that used in and around the orientale basin on the moon and should aid in the future recognition of

alfred errera published it in 1921 as a counterexample to kempe s erroneous proof of the four color theorem it was named after errera by the errera graph is planar and has chromatic number 4 chromatic index 6 radius 3 diameter 4 and girth 3 all its vertices are of degree 5 or 6 and it is a 5 vertex connected graph and a 5 edge connected graph the errera graph is not a vertex transitive graph and its full automorphism group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 20 the group of symmetries of a decagon including both rotations and reflections the characteristic polynomial of the errera graph is formula 1 the four color theorem states that the vertices of every planar graph can be colored with four colors so that no two adjacent vertices have equal colors an erroneous proof was published in 1879 by alfred kempe but it was discovered to be erroneous by 1890 the four color theorem was not given a valid proof until 1976 kempe s proof can be translated into an algorithm to color planar graphs which is also erroneous counterexamples to his proof were found in 1890 and 1896 the poussin

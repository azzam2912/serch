in the gut the ingested protein is split into an insoluble peptide para kappa casein and a soluble hydrophilic glycopeptide caseinomacropeptide caseinomacropeptide is responsible for increased efficiency of digestion prevention of neonate hypersensitivity to ingested proteins and inhibition of gastric pathogens caseins are a family of phosphoproteins s1 s2 that account for nearly 80 of bovine milk proteins and that form soluble aggregates known as casein micelles in which casein molecules stabilize the structure there are several models that account for the special conformation of casein in the micelles one of them proposes that the micellar nucleus is formed by several submicelles the periphery consisting of microvellosities of casein another model suggests that the nucleus is formed by casein interlinked fibrils finally the most recent model proposes a double link among the caseins for gelling to take place all 3 models consider micelles as colloidal particles formed by casein aggregates wrapped up in soluble casein molecules milk clotting proteases act on the soluble portion casein thus originating an unstable micellar state that results in clot formation chymosin ec 3 4 23 4 is an aspartic protease that specifically hydrolyzes the peptide bond in phe105 met106 of casein and is considered

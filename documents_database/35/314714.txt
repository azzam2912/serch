it has the formula of chf difluoromethane is a molecule used as refrigerant that has zero ozone depletion potential odp a global warming potential gwp index 675 times that of carbon dioxide based on a 100 year time frame and it is classified as a2l slightly flammable by ashrae difluoromethane has excellent heat transfer and pressure drop performance both in condensation and vaporisation therefore in spite of its mild flammability it seems to be a very promising low gwp substitute for traditional hfc refrigerants difluoromethane in a zeotropic 50 50 mass mixture with pentafluoroethane r 125 is known as r 410a a common replacement for various chlorofluorocarbons aka freon in new refrigerant systems especially for air conditioning the zeotropic mix of difluoromethane with pentafluoroethane r 125 and tetrafluoroethane r 134a is known as r 407a through r 407e depending on the composition likewise the azeotropic 48 2 51 8 mass mixture with chlorotrifluoromethane r13 difluoromethane is currently used in residential and commercial air conditioners in japan china and india as substitute for r 410a in order to reduce the residual risk associated with its mild flammability this molecule should be applied in heat transfer equipment with low refrigerant charge such

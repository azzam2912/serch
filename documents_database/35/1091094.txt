the word is usually but not exclusively applied to marine mollusks although in addition numerous species of land snails and freshwater mollusks also reach adult size at very small dimensions these tiny mollusks or their tiny shells are easy to overlook as many of them are not very noticeable to the naked eye and thus many people are not aware that they even exist nonetheless there are large numbers of families and vast numbers of mollusk species in particular marine gastropods or sea snails which are minute enough to be considered micromollusks considerable numbers of marine gastropod species are only about 5 or 6 mm in adult size many others are only about 2 or 3 mm in adult size and a few have adult shells which are as small as one millimeter or even smaller still despite their tiny size many of the shells have a good deal of elaborate sculpture a fair number of them are even quite colorful although many others are colorless and translucent certain species of micromollusks are very common in the right habitat and can on occasion be present in huge numbers however because of their minute size micromollusks often go unnoticed by beachcombers

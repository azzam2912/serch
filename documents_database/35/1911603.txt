it is a neutral stable compound kifunensine is a potent inhibitor of the mannosidase i enzyme and is primarily used in cell culture to make high mannose glycoproteins inside a cell it prevents endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase i erm1 from trimming mannose residues from precursor glycoproteins kifunensine shows no inhibitory action against mannosidase ii or the endoplasmic reticulum alpha mannosidase and it weakly inhibits arylmannosidase when incorporated in cell culture media kifunensine has shown no significant impact on cell growth or glycoprotein production yield kifunensine has shown potential for treatment of sarcoglycanopathies and lysosomal storage disorders kifunensine was first isolated by iwami et al in 1987 and described as a new type of immunoactive substance it was originally prepared by culturing the actinobacterium kitasatosporia kifunense in a suitable medium at 25 33 c for several days followed by extraction of the alkaloid the structure of kifunensine was published in 1989 by kayakiri et al kifunensine is a potent inhibitor of the mannosidase i enzyme it is 50 to 100 times more potent than deoxymannojirimycin an alkaloid with a similar structure kifunensine inhibits human endoplasmic reticulum 1 2 mannosidase i and golgi class i mannosidases ia ib and ic with ki values

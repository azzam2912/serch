this was frequently done by governments in order to inflate the amount of currency in circulation typically some of the precious metal was replaced by a cheaper metal when the coin was minted but when done by an individual precious metal was physically removed from the coin which could then be passed on at the original face value leaving the debaser with a profit coin debasement was effected by several methods including clipping shaving metal from the coin s circumference and sweating shaking the coins in a bag and collecting the dust worn off until the mid 20th century coins were often made of silver or gold which were quite soft and prone to wear this meant coins naturally got lighter and thus less valuable as they aged so coins that had lost a small amount of bullion would go unnoticed modern coins are made of hard cheap metals such as steel copper or a copper nickel alloy reducing wear and making it difficult and unprofitable to debase them clipping is the act of shaving off a small portion of a precious metal coin for profit over time the precious metal clippings could be saved up and melted into bullion

though it performed as well as its conventional contemporaries it did not offer sufficiently improved performance to compensate for its difficult handling characteristics the akaflieg braunschweig or akademische fliegergruppe braunschweig is one of some fourteen german undergraduate student flying groups attached to and supported by their home technical university several have designed and built aircraft often technically advanced and leading the development of gliders in particular in 1982 when the sb 13 design was first discussed no new tailless glider had been built for thirty years during which time glass reinforced plastic materials had replaced wood in glider construction and much learned about laminar flow wings it was hoped that tailless designs would be lighter simpler and cheaper work on the sb 13 arcus named after the cloud formation began in 1982 because of the novelty of the layout a one third scale model of the early design was built and flown revealing several serious problems strong flutter was experienced even at modest speed and the aircraft was very sensitive to the centre of gravity c g position it stalled readily when this was too far aft recovery from the spin that followed was difficult with the c g too

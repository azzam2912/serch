why are we willing to trust machines in some areas and not others dhar s view is that there is a discontinuity when we give complete decision making control to a machine that learns from ongoing data this discontinuity introduces some risks specifically those around the errors made by such systems which directly impact our degree of trust in them dhar s research breaks down trust along 2 risk based dimensions predictability or how frequently a system makes mistakes x axis and the associated costs of error y axis of such mistakes the research demonstrates the existence of an automation frontier that expresses a tradeoff between how often a system will be wrong and the consequences of such mistakes trust and hence our willingness to cede control of decision making to the machine increases with increasing predictability and lower error costs in other words we are willing to trust machines if they don t make too many mistakes and their costs are tolerable as mistakes increase we require that their consequences be less costly the automation frontier provides a natural way to think about the future of work with more and better data and algorithms parts of existing processes become

these are determined by three main types of selection dynamics negative frequency dependent selection when a rare allele has a selective advantage overdominance caused by heterozygote advantage and directional selective sweeps near an advantageous mutation theories of host parasite coevolution include the geographic mosaic theory which assumes a selection mosaic coevolutionary hotspots and geographic mixing the red queen hypothesis which proposes that parasitism favours sexual reproduction in the host and an evolutionary trade off between transmission and virulence since if the parasite kills its host too quickly the parasite will not be able to reproduce model systems include the nematode caenorhabditis elegans with the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis the crustacean daphnia and its numerous parasites and escherichia coli and the mammals including humans whose intestines it inhabits hosts and parasites exert reciprocal selective pressures on each other which may lead to rapid reciprocal adaptation for organisms with short generation times host parasite coevolution can be observed in comparatively small time periods making it possible to study evolutionary change in real time under both field and laboratory conditions these interactions may thus serve as a counter example to the common notion that evolution can only be detected across extended time the dynamics

among stable nuclei and naturally occurring nuclei this ratio generally increases with increasing atomic number this is because electrical repulsive forces between protons scale with distance differently than strong nuclear force attractions in particular most pairs of protons in large nuclei are not far enough apart such that electrical repulsion dominates over the strong nuclear force and thus proton density in stable larger nuclei must be lower than in stable smaller nuclei where more pairs of protons have appreciable short range nuclear force attractions for each element with atomic number z small enough to occupy only the first three nuclear shells that is up to that of calcium z 20 there exists a stable isotope with n z ratio of one with the exception of beryllium n z 1 25 and every element with odd atomic number between 9 and 19 inclusive n z 1 hydrogen 1 n z ratio 0 and helium 3 n z ratio 0 5 are the only stable isotopes with neutron proton ratio under one uranium 238 has the highest n z ratio of any primordial nuclide at 1 587 while lead 208 has the highest n z ratio of any known stable isotope at

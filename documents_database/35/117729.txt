a peltier cooler heater or thermoelectric heat pump is a solid state active heat pump which transfers heat from one side of the device to the other with consumption of electrical energy depending on the direction of the current such an instrument is also called a peltier device peltier heat pump solid state refrigerator or thermoelectric cooler tec it can be used either for heating or for cooling although in practice the main application is cooling it can also be used as a temperature controller that either heats or cools this technology is far less commonly applied to refrigeration than vapor compression refrigeration is the primary advantages of a peltier cooler compared to a vapor compression refrigerator are its lack of moving parts or circulating liquid very long life invulnerability to leaks small size and flexible shape its main disadvantages are high cost for a given cooling capacity and poor power efficiency many researchers and companies are trying to develop peltier coolers that are cheap and efficient see thermoelectric materials a peltier cooler can also be used as a thermoelectric generator when operated as a cooler a voltage is applied across the device and as a result a difference in

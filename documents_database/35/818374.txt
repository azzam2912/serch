it is secreted by mesenchymal cells and targets and acts primarily upon epithelial cells and endothelial cells but also acts on haemopoietic progenitor cells and t cells it has been shown to have a major role in embryonic organ development specifically in myogenesis in adult organ regeneration and in wound healing hepatocyte growth factor regulates cell growth cell motility and morphogenesis by activating a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade after binding to the proto oncogenic c met receptor hepatocyte growth factor is secreted by mesenchymal cells and acts as a multi functional cytokine on cells of mainly epithelial origin its ability to stimulate mitogenesis cell motility and matrix invasion gives it a central role in angiogenesis tumorogenesis and tissue regeneration it is secreted as a single inactive polypeptide and is cleaved by serine proteases into a 69 kda alpha chain and 34 kda beta chain a disulfide bond between the alpha and beta chains produces the active heterodimeric molecule the protein belongs to the plasminogen subfamily of s1 peptidases but has no detectable protease activity human hgf plasmid dna therapy of cardiomyocytes is being examined as a potential treatment for coronary artery disease as well as treatment for the damage that

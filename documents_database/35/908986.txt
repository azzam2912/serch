then a n ron model of a is defined to be a smooth separated scheme a over r with fiber a that is universal in the following sense in particular the canonical map formula 1 is an isomorphism if a n ron model exists then it is unique up to unique isomorphism in terms of sheaves any scheme a over spec k represents a sheaf on the category of schemes smooth over spec k with the smooth grothendieck topology and this has a pushforward by the injection map from spec k to spec r which is a sheaf over spec r if this pushforward is representable by a scheme then this scheme is the n ron model of a in general the scheme a need not have any n ron model for abelian varieties a n ron models exist and are unique up to unique isomorphism and are commutative quasi projective group schemes over r the fiber of a n ron model over a closed point of spec r is a smooth commutative algebraic group but need not be an abelian variety for example it may be disconnected or a torus n ron models exist as well for certain commutative

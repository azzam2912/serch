organosilicon chemistry is the corresponding science of their preparation and properties most organosilicon compounds are similar to the ordinary organic compounds being colourless flammable hydrophobic and stable to air silicon carbide is an inorganic compound organosilicon compounds are widely encountered in commercial products most common are sealants caulks sealant adhesives and coatings made from silicones other important uses include synthesis of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes agricultural and plant control adjuvants commonly used in conjunction with herbicides and fungicides carbon silicon bonds are naturally absent in biology however enzymes have been used to artificially create carbon silicon bonds in living microbes silicates on the other hand have known existence in diatoms silafluofen is an organosilicon compound that functions as a pyrethroid insecticide several organosilicon compounds have been investigated as pharmaceuticals in most organosilicon compounds si is tetravalent with tetrahedral molecular geometry carbon silicon bonds compared to carbon carbon bonds are longer 186 pm vs 154 pm and weaker with bond dissociation energy 451 kj mol vs 607 kj mol the c si bond is somewhat polarised towards carbon due to carbon s greater electronegativity c 2 55 vs si 1 90 the si c bond can be broken more readily than typical

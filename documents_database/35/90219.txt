sucrose or lactose are converted into cellular energy and the metabolite lactate which is lactic acid in solution it is an anaerobic fermentation reaction that occurs in some bacteria and animal cells such as muscle cells if oxygen is present in the cell many organisms will bypass fermentation and undergo cellular respiration however facultative anaerobic organisms will both ferment and undergo respiration in the presence of oxygen sometimes even when oxygen is present and aerobic metabolism is happening in the mitochondria if pyruvate is building up faster than it can be metabolized the fermentation will happen anyway lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of nadh and nad in homolactic fermentation one molecule of glucose is ultimately converted to two molecules of lactic acid heterolactic fermentation in contrast yields carbon dioxide and ethanol in addition to lactic acid in a process called the phosphoketolase pathway several chemists discovered during the 19th century some fundamental concepts of the domain of organic chemistry one of them for example was the french chemist joseph louis gay lussac who was especially interested in fermentation processes and he passed this fascination to one of his best students justus von liebig

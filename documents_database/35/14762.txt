it is sometimes paraphrased by a statement like the simplest solution is most likely the right one but is the same as the razor only if results match occam s razor says that when presented with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions and it is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions similarly in science occam s razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models in the scientific method occam s razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon there may be an extremely large perhaps even incomprehensible number of possible and more complex alternatives since one can always burden failing explanations with ad hoc hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more testable the term occam s razor did not appear until a few centuries after william of ockham s death

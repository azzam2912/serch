the north american subspecies is often simply but ambiguously called giant horsetail but that name may just as well refer to the latin american equisetum giganteum and equisetum myriochaetum it is a herbaceous perennial plant with separate green photosynthetic sterile stems and pale yellowish non photosynthetic spore bearing fertile stems the sterile stems produced in late spring and dying down in late autumn are 30 150 cm rarely to 240 cm tall the tallest species of horsetail outside of tropical regions and 1 cm diameter heavily branched with whorls of 14 40 branches these up to 20 cm long 1 2 mm diameter and unbranched emerging from the axils of a ring of bracts the fertile stems are produced in early spring before the sterile shoots growing to 15 45 cm tall with an apical spore bearing strobilus 4 10 cm long and 1 2 cm broad and no side branches the spores disperse in mid spring with the fertile stems dying immediately after spore release it also spreads by means of rhizomes that have been observed to penetrate 4 meters into wet clay soil spreading laterally in multiple layers occasional plants produce stems that are both fertile and photosynthetic

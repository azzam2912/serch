in primates alpha lactalbumin expression is upregulated in response to the hormone prolactin and increases the production of lactose lactalbumin forms the regulatory subunit of the lactose synthase ls heterodimer and 1 4 galactosyltransferase beta4gal t1 forms the catalytic component together these proteins enable ls to produce lactose by transferring galactose moieties to glucose as a multimer alpha lactalbumin strongly binds calcium and zinc ions and may possess bactericidal or antitumor activity a folding variant of human alpha lactalbumin that may form in acidic environments such as the stomach called hamlet probably induces apoptosis in tumor and immature cells the corresponding folding dynamics of alpha lactalbumin is thus highly unusual when formed into a complex with gal t1 a galactosyltransferase lactalbumin enhances the enzyme s affinity for glucose by about 1000 times and inhibits the ability to polymerise multiple galactose units this gives rise to a pathway for forming lactose by converting gal ti to lactose synthase the structure of alpha lactalbumin is well known and is composed of 123 amino acids and 4 disulfide bridges the molecular weight is 14178 da and the isoelectric point is between 4 2 and 4 5 one of the main structural differences with

the global efficiency of network is a measure comparable to formula 12 rather than just the average path length itself the key distinction is that formula 12 measures efficiency in a system where only one packet of information is being moved through the network and formula 14 measures the efficiency where all the nodes are exchanging packets of information with each other as an alternative to the clustering coefficient of a network the local efficiency of a network is defined as where formula 16 is the local subgraph consisting only of a node formula 1 s immediate neighbors but not the node formula 1 itself broadly speaking the efficiency of a network can be used to quantify small world behavior in networks efficiency can also be used to determine cost effective structures in weighted and unweighted networks for these reasons the concept of efficiency has been used across the many diverse applications of network science beyond human constructed networks efficiency is a useful metric when talking about physical biological networks in any facet of biology the scarcity of resource plays a key role and biological networks are no exception efficiency is used in neuroscience to discuss information transfer across neural

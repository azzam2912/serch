this contrasts with non traditional approaches to math education traditional mathematics education has been challenged by several reform movements over the last several decades notably new math a now largely abandoned and discredited set of alternative methods and most recently reform or standards based mathematics based on nctm standards which is federally supported and has been widely adopted but subject to ongoing criticism the topics and methods of traditional mathematics are well documented in books and open source articles of many nations and languages major topics covered include in general traditional methods are based on direct instruction where students are shown one standard method of performing a task such as decimal addition in a standard sequence a task is taught in isolation rather than as only a part of a more complex project by contrast reform books often postpone standard methods until students have the necessary background to understand the procedures students in modern curricula often explore their own methods for multiplying multi digit numbers deepening their understanding of multiplication principles before being guided to the standard algorithm parents sometimes misunderstand this approach to mean that the children will not be taught formulas and standard algorithms and therefore there are

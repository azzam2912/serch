study subjects are shielded from all time cues often by a constant light protocol by a constant dark protocol or by the use of light dark conditions to which the organism cannot entrain such as the ultrashort protocol of one hour dark and two hours light also limited amounts of food may be made available at short intervals so as to avoid entrainment to mealtimes subjects are thus forced to live by their internal circadian clocks the individual s or animal s circadian phase can be known only by the monitoring of some kind of output of the circadian system the internal body clock the researcher can precisely determine for example the daily cycles of gene activity body temperature blood pressure hormone secretion and or sleep and activity alertness alertness in humans can be determined by many kinds of verbal and non verbal tests activity in animals by observation for example of wheel running in rodents when animals or people free run experiments can be done to see what sort of signals known as zeitgebers are effective in entrainment also much work has been done to see how long or short a circadian cycle to which different organisms can be

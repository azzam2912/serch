three finger toxins are in turn members of a larger superfamily of three finger protein domains which includes non toxic proteins that share a similar protein fold the group is named for its common structure consisting of three beta strand loops connected to a central core containing four conserved disulfide bonds the 3fp protein domain has no enzymatic activity and is typically between 60 74 amino acid residues long despite their conserved structure three finger toxin proteins have a wide range of pharmacological effects most members of the family are neurotoxins that act on cholinergic intercellular signaling the alpha neurotoxin family interacts with muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nachrs the kappa bungarotoxin family with neuronal nachrs and muscarinic toxins with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors machrs the three finger toxin superfamily is defined by a common tertiary structure consisting of three beta strand containing loops designated loops i ii and iii projecting from a small hydrophobic core containing four conserved disulfide bonds this structure is thought to resemble a hand with three fingers giving rise to the name the proteins are typically 60 74 amino acid residues long though some have additional n or c terminal extensions an additional disulfide bond may be

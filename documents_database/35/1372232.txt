biological psychopathology attempts to explain psychiatric disorders using multiple levels of analysis from the genome to brain functioning to behavior although closely related to clinical psychology it is fundamentally an interdisciplinary approach that attempts to synthesize methods across fields such as neuroscience psychopharmacology biochemistry genetics and physiology it is known by several alternative names including clinical neuroscience and experimental psychopathology due to the focus on biological processes of the central and peripheral nervous systems biological psychopathology has been important in developing new biologically based treatments for mental disorders biological psychopathology is a field that focuses mostly on the research and understanding the biological basis of major mental disorders such as bipolar and unipolar affective disorder schizophrenia and alzheimer s disease much of the understanding thus far has come from neuroimaging techniques such as radiotracer positron emission tomography pet and functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri scans as well as genetic studies together neuroimaging with multimodal pet fmri and pharmacological investigations are revealing how the differences in behaviorally relevant brain activations can arise from underlying variations in certain brain signaling pathways understanding the detailed interplay between neurotransmitters and the psychiatric drugs that affect them are key to the research within this field

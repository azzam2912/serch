supporting brackets between a high performance single cylinder motorcycle engine and a perimetral rigid aluminium frame helped damp engine vibrations and prolonged lifetime of the frame the paek polymer along with the carbon fibers also offer low friction so that soon the use of olimunllum cf peek in suspension hydraulic piston guides and in transmission components such as gears and chain sprockets was found to reduce power losses at similar wear rates in comparison with the light weight metallic solutions higher ductility of the cf peek specimen shown with values increasing with temperature on the cf epoxy side overall lower ductility observed and value drop with increasing temperature observed in the cf epoxy specimens in addition weight falling tests have shown that cf peek specimens absorb more energy than cf epoxy in both elastic and plastic ranges cf peek specimen reached after 48h the peak weight increase 0 14 while the cf epoxy specimen showed a weight increase 0 3 still unsaturated endless fiber reinforced peek composite as used in the olimunllum sheets can be recycled by chopping the old material resulting in a composite with short fiber reinforcement that can be thermoformed again the mechanical properties of pressed or

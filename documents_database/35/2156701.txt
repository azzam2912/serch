the cycle routes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel then is exhausted since not all fuel flows through the throat into the nozzle the tap off cycle is considered an open cycle engine the cycle is comparable to a gas generator cycle engine with turbines driven by main combustion chamber exhaust rather than a separate gas generator or preburner the j 2s rocket engine a cancelled engine developed by nasa used the combustion tap off cycle and was first successfully tested in 1969 by 2013 blue origin with their new shepard launch vehicle had successfully flight tested the be 3 engine using a tap off cycle according to blue origin the cycle is particularly suited to human spaceflight due to its simplicity with only one combustion chamber and a less stressful engine shutdown process however engine startup is more complicated and due to its nature of feeding gases from the main combustion chamber into the turbopumps the turbine must be built to withstand higher than normal temperatures in contrast the upper stage variant of the be 3 the be 3u uses an expander cycle to

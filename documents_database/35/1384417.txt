oacs combine the representational and computational efficiency for purposes of search the frame problem of strips rules and the object and situation oriented concept of affordance with the logical clarity of the event calculus affordance is the relation between a situation usually including an object of a defined type and the actions that it allows while affordances have mostly been analyzed in their purely perceptual aspect the oac concept defines them more generally as state transition functions suited to prediction such functions can be used for efficient forward chaining planning learning and execution of actions represented simultaneously at multiple levels in an embodied agent architecture the paco project an integrated project funded by the european commission through its cognition unit under the information society technologies of the sixth framework programme fp6 and launched on 1 february 2006 brings together an interdisciplinary research team to design and build cognitive robots capable of developing perceptual behavioural and cognitive categories that can be used communicated and shared with other humans and artificial agents in the project they hypothesize that such understanding can only be attained by embodied agents and requires the simultaneous consideration of perception and action resting on three foundational assumptions

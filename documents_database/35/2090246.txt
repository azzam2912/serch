the term is often used interchangeably with nanomotor despite the implicit size difference these micromotors actually propel themselves in a specific direction autonomously when placed in a chemical solution there are many different micromotor types operating under a host of mechanisms easily the most important examples are biological motors such as bacteria and any other self propelled cells synthetically researchers have exploited oxidation reduction reactions to produce chemical gradients local fluid flows or streams of bubbles that then propel these micromotors through chemical media micromotors may have applications in medicine since they have been shown to be able to deliver materials to living cells within an organism they also have been shown to be effective in degrading certain chemical and biological warfare agents janus sphere micromotors usually consist of a titanium dioxide surface layer and a strong reducing agent inner layer the interaction of the two layer under irradiation of uv light produces bubbles as a result of a reduction reaction micromotors usually have a size of about 30 m with a small 2 m opening on the outer layer this leads to the exposure of the inner core which is typically the fuel source for the propulsion mechanism the

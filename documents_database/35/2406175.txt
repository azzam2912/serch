an eclipsing binary its apparent magnitude has a maximum of 7 56 dimming to 8 25 during primary eclipse and 8 19 during secondary eclipse from parallax measurements by the gaia spacecraft the system is located at a distance of from earth ae phoenicis is a contact binary of w ursae majoris type composed of two stars so close that their surfaces touch each other they are separated by 2 70 solar radii and orbit each other with a period of 0 3624 days they are both classified as g type main sequence stars of spectral type g0v with effective temperatures of 6 083 and 6 310 k the system is classified as a w ursae majoris variable of subtype w where the secondary star is hotter than the primary for this reason the primary eclipses are caused by the occultation of the secondary star the orbit is circular and is inclined by 86 5 in relation to the plane of the sky the combination of photometric and spectroscopic data have allowed the direct determination of the parameters of the stars the primary component has a mass of 1 38 times the solar mass and a radius of 1 29

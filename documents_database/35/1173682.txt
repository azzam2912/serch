at the time the channel that currently serves as the main channel of the nooksack river was restricted by a massive mile long log jam in the late 19th century with an interest in creating a navigable waterway that would empty into bellingham bay and be usable beyond ferndale the city of bellingham commissioned the removal of the log jam once the log jam was removed the river s flow shifted into the southern channel and the headwaters of the lummi river were restricted by a dam which was later damaged then replaced by a dam and spillway system which was also later damaged today the lummi river is currently only fed by water from the nooksack river during times of high water by a culvert that passes through the levee the lummi river today is characterized by a narrow channel as its main purpose is now as a high water overflow it has been artificially channelized and diked to prevent flooding or surrounding fields it has a low as a result of its short course across glacially ploughed flatlands the considerable reduction in the flow of the river has allowed erosive processes to strongly affect the lummi river delta

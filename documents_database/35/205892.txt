the opposite a squeeze catch is when more than one ball is caught in the hand simultaneously on the same beat if a multiplex throw were time reversed it would be a squeeze catch multiplex throws are given different names depending on the number of balls used for example a one ball throw with one ball held would be called a uniplex a two ball throw would be called a duplex and a three ball throw a triplex a four and a five ball throw would be called a quadruplex and a quintuplex respectively multiplex throws are generally grouped into different categories stack split cut and slice stacked multiplex throws involve throwing both balls from one hand and catching them both in the same or other hand split multiplex throws as the name suggests involve throwing both balls from one hand splitting them in the air and catching them in separate hands cut multiplex throws involve throwing both balls to the same or other hand like a stacked multiplex but in a staggered fashion so the bottom ball of the duplex is caught and re thrown before the top ball is caught these are used in the shower explosion family

snake tongue plants are a small group of pteridophyte plants traditionally they were included in the ferns originally as a family and later as the order ophioglossales in some classifications this group is placed in a separate division the ophioglossophyta but recent molecular systematic studies have shown the ophioglossales to be closely related to the psilotales and both are placed in the class ophioglossidae in the molecular phylogenetic classification of smith et al in 2006 ophioglossales in its present circumscription was placed with the order psilotales in the class psilotopsida the linear sequence of christenhusz et al 2011 intended for compatibility with the classification of chase and reveal 2009 which placed all land plants in equisetopsida made it a member of subclass ophioglossidae equivalent to smith s psilotopsida the placement of ophioglossales in subclass ophioglossidae has subsequently been followed in the classifications of christenhusz and chase 2014 and ppg i 2016 older treatments have recognized segregate families within ophioglossales such as botrychiaceae for the moonworts and grape ferns and helminthostachyaceae for helminthostachys but all modern treatments combine all members of the order into the single family ophioglossaceae the plants have short lived spores formed in sporangia lacking an annulus and

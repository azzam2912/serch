the team led by bernard gregory completed the construction of the chamber in 1960 and later it was moved to cern and installed at the proton synchrotron ps a series of experiments began in 1961 which provided data on the properties of hadronic resonances firstly the chamber was irradiated by a beam rich of low energy antiprotons enabling the study of antiproton proton annihilations at rest these annihilations generated several bosonic particles and some of them led to the formation of pairs of k mesons also it allowed the study and eventually the discovery of mesonic resonances with emphasis on kaon production subsequently the chamber was exposed to various particles such as k k and antiprotons at various momenta up to 10 gev c the experiments with low energy k beams resulted in the systematic studies of quasi elastic reactions on protons directly correlated to strange baryonic resonances the exposure to higher energy beams allowed the first evidence of the anti particle and enabled the discovery and analysis of various mesonic and baryonic resonances additionally in 1963 the chamber started its operation with liquid deuterium resulting in quasi elastic reactions of k on a neutrons instead of protons an interesting

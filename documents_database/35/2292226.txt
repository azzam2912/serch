it fell in the morawa region of western australia on 31 october 2016 8 05 pm local time and was recovered less than a week later on the morning of 7 november in a paddock at dingle dell farm given the rapid turnaround for meteorite recovery and a lack of rainfall between fall date and find date the rock is in pristine condition and shows no evidence of terrestrial weathering w0 this particular meteorite fall demonstrates the proficiency of the dfn as a sample recovery tool for meteoritics the rock is 1 15 kg in mass and approximately 16 9 4 cm in size it was originally slightly wedged shaped with pristine fusion crust that is both primary and secondary which indicate this rock broke up as it was passing through the earth s atmosphere dingle dell contains chondrules between 1 15 4 11 mm in diameter that are poorly defined which is characteristic of a type 5 ordinary chondrite and moderate amounts of thermal metamorphism both olivine and pyroxene have undulose extinction which is evidence for mild shock and therefore this rock is classified as an s2 bulk density is 3 23 g cm and grain density is 3

the actual color of the wine can range from intense violet typical of young wines through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines the juice from most purple grapes is greenish white the red color coming from anthocyan pigments also called anthocyanins present in the skin of the grape exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties which produce a red colored juice much of the red wine production process therefore involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin the first step in red wine production after picking involves physical processing of the grapes hand picked or machine harvested grapes are usually tipped into a receival bin when they arrive at the winery and conveyed by a screw mechanism to the grape processing equipment on arrival at the winery there is usually a mixture of individual berries whole bunches particularly with hand picked grapes stems and leaves the presence of stems during fermentation can lead to a bitter taste in the wine and the purpose of destemming is to separate grapes from the stems and leaves mechanical de stemmers usually consist of a rotating cage perforated with grape sized holes within this cage

the anthraquinone must already have at least one hydroxy group the reaction was first described in 1889 by ren bohn 1862 1922 and in 1891 by robert emanuel schmidt 1864 1938 two german industrial chemists ren bohn is one of the few industrial chemists after whom a reaction is named in 1901 he made indanthrone from 2 aminoanthraquinone and thus laid the basis for a new group of dyes the postulated reaction mechanism is explained below for the example of 2 hydroxyanthraquinone the sulfuric acid protonates the keto group of the anthraquinone 1 this causes a shift of the electrons to the oxonium ion in molecule 2 this shift enables the sulfuric acid to attack the carbenium ion 3 which is formed the sulfuric acid oxidizes the resulting hydroxyanthracenone 5 which is then protonated and the reaction starts all over again finally polyhydroxyanthraquinones with different numbers of hydroxy groups are obtained the reaction proceeds best at 25 50 c and takes up to several weeks to complete the presence of a catalyst such as selenium or mercury accelerate the reaction by adding boric acid sulfuric acid can be used instead of fuming sulfuric acid if boric acid is used it

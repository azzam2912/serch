on april 8 under harsh conditions while his two ships were trapped by ice forcing him to winter over at melville island in the northern canadian arctic archipelago he made a drawing of the phenomenon the drawing accurately renders the parhelic circle a 22 halo a pair of sun dogs a lower tangent arc a 46 halo and a circumzenithal arc he did however get the upper tangent arc slightly wrong on the other hand he added two arcs extending laterally from the bases of the 46 halo for long interpreted as incorrectly drawn infralateral arcs but were probably correctly drawn subhelic arcs both produced by the same crystal orientation but with light passing through different faces of the crystals parry arcs are generated by double oriented hexagonal column crystals i e a so called parry orientation where both the central main axis of the prism and the top and bottom prism side faces are oriented horizontally this orientation is responsible for several rare haloes parry arcs are the result of light passing through two side faces forming a 60 angle the shape of parry arcs changes with the elevation of the sun and are subsequently called upper or lower

these aircraft are unique to nasa or are commercial aircraft they are equipped with sensors that provide data for nasa s spaceborne missions this program is part of the earth science division and is what provides new aircraft systems that will further science and make better the use of data from satellites there are four main goals to the program and those are satellite calibration and validation support new sensor development process studies and develop the next generation of scientists and engineers calibration is defined as the process of quantitatively defining the system response to known controlled signal inputs validation is defined as the process of assessing by independent means the quality of the data provided higher level products can be successfully generated from satellite sensor data only if both calibration and validation are present this allows earth observation satellites the ability to get calibration measurements and allows them to get validation of their data retrieval algorithms when using sensors to gain data science platform aircraft use remote sensors these can be broken into two groups active and passive active sensors emit radiation in the direction of the object they are observing causing it to light up to get a

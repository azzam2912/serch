this computer rather than individual instruments can determine the calibrated airspeed mach number altitude and altitude trend data from an aircraft s pitot static system in some very high speed aircraft such as the space shuttle equivalent airspeed is calculated instead of calibrated airspeed the first air data computer patented in the us was developed by john h andresen in february 1971 air data computers usually also have an input of total air temperature this enables computation of static air temperature and true airspeed from the late 1980s much of the usaf and usn aircraft fleets were retrofitted with the gec avionics rochester developed standard centralised air data computer scadc aircraft fitted included the a 4 skyhawk a 6 intruder a 7 corsair c 5a b galaxy ea 6b prowler f 111 aardvark f 4 phantom s 3 viking c 141 starlifter c 135 stratolifter c 2 greyhound and e 2 hawkeye for which the company received the queens award for technological achievement in airbus aircraft the air data computer is combined with altitude heading and navigation sources in a single unit known as the air data inertial reference unit adiru this has now been replaced by the global navigation

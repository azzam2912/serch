it represents the broadest class of forcings for which a forcing axiom is consistent martin s maximum mm states that if d is a collection of formula 1 dense subsets of a notion of forcing that preserves stationary subsets of then there is a d generic filter forcing with a ccc notion of forcing preserves stationary subsets of thus mm extends ma formula 1 if p is not a stationary set preserving notion of forcing i e there is a stationary subset of which becomes nonstationary when forcing with p then there is a collection d of formula 1 dense subsets of p such that there is no d generic filter this is why mm is called the maximal extension of martin s axiom the existence of a supercompact cardinal implies the consistency of martin s maximum the proof uses shelah s theories of semiproper forcing and iteration with revised countable supports mm implies that the value of the continuum is formula 4 and that the ideal of nonstationary sets on is formula 4 saturated it further implies stationary reflection i e if s is a stationary subset of some regular cardinal and every element of s has countable cofinality

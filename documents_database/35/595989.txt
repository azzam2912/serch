the pitcher receives 50 to begin with and loses no points because there are no hits walks or runs of any kind he receives 27 points for the 27 outs and 10 points for five innings completed after the fourth inning for a total of 87 in this perfect score scenario the pitcher would have to strike out every hitter he faced netting him an additional 27 points for a grand total of 114 the absolute maximum possible score requires the extremely unlikely scenario in which three base runners reach base each inning on wild pitches or passed balls on third strikes if this were to happen such that no one scored and the pitcher recorded all outs by strikeout a pitcher could theoretically record six strikeouts per inning and thus 54 for the game netting him 54 points in addition to the 87 he would have received as described above for a total of 141 the highest game score for a nine inning game in the history of baseball is kerry wood s one hit no walk 20 strikeout shutout performance for the chicago cubs against the houston astros on may 6 1998 his game score was 105 50

the nociceptin receptor is a member of the opioid subfamily of g protein coupled receptors whose natural ligand is the 17 amino acid neuropeptide known as nociceptin n ofq this receptor is involved in the regulation of numerous brain activities particularly instinctive and emotional behaviors antagonists targeting nop are under investigation for their role as treatments for depression and parkinson s disease whereas nop agonists have been shown to act as powerful non addictive painkillers in non human primates although nop shares high sequence identity 60 with the classical opioid receptors op mop op kop and op dop it possesses little or no affinity for opioid peptides or morphine like compounds likewise classical opioid receptors possess little affinity towards nop s endogenous ligand nociceptin which is structurally related to dynorphin a in 1994 mollereau et al cloned a receptor that was highly homologous to the classical opioid receptors ops or mop or kop and or dop that came to be known as the nociceptin opioid peptide receptor nop as these classical opioid receptors were identified 30 years earlier in the mid 1960s the physiological and pharmacological characterization of nop as well as therapeutic development targeting this receptor remain decades behind

it may be created by computer programs for a variety of purposes principally when a program cannot allocate enough memory for its tasks when the program is working on data bigger than the architecture s address space or as a primitive form of inter process communication modern operating systems employ virtual memory however programs that use large amounts of data e g video editing may need to create temporary file s most operating systems offer primitives such as pipes sockets or shared memory to pass data among programs but often the simplest way especially for programs that follow the unix philosophy is to write data into a temporary file and inform the receiving program of the location of the temporary file on posix systems temporary files can be safely created with the codice 1 or library functions some systems provide the former posix now removed program these files are typically located in the standard temporary directory tmp on unix machines or temp which is log in specific on windows machines a temporary file created with is deleted automatically when the program exits or the file is closed to generate a temporary file name that will survive past the lifespan of

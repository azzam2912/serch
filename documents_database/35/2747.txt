if an evacuated glass tube is equipped with two electrodes and a voltage is applied glass behind the positive electrode is observed to glow due to electrons emitted from the cathode the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the voltage supply they were first observed in 1869 by german physicist julius pl cker and johann wilhelm hittorf and were named in 1876 by eugen goldstein kathodenstrahlen or cathode rays in 1897 british physicist j j thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle which was later named the electron cathode ray tubes crts use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to render an image on a screen cathode rays are so named because they are emitted by the negative electrode or cathode in a vacuum tube to release electrons into the tube they first must be detached from the atoms of the cathode in the early cold cathode vacuum tubes called crookes tubes this was done by using a high electrical potential of thousands of volts between the anode and the cathode to ionize the residual gas atoms in the tube the positive ions were accelerated by the

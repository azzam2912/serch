and boston he was a program officer at the ford foundation after serving as a professor of political science at mit he is well known in the field of public administration for his classic book about street level bureaucracy the concept of street level bureaucracy was popularized by michael lipsky in 1980 he argued that policy implementation in the end comes down to the people who actually implement it he argued that state employees such as police and social workers should be seen as part of the policy making community and as exercisers of political power lipsky identified several problems with street level bureaucracy including the problem of limited resources the continuous negotiation that is necessary in order to make it seem like one is meeting targets and the relations with nonvoluntary clients however some commentators have challenged lipsky s model tony evans and john harris argue that the proliferation of rules and regulations should not automatically be equated with greater control over professional discretion paradoxically more rules may create more discretion they also argue that the exercise of professional discretion by street level bureaucrats is not inherently bad but can be seen as an important professional attribute

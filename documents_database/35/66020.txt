the population was 354 at the 2010 census it is included in the cleveland metropolitan statistical area starting around the time of the civil war the production method for removing the sulphur from the copper ore mined in the area required building bonfires throwing in the ore and burning off the sulphur this necessitated cutting most of the trees in the valley for the bonfires the acid rain caused by the burning of the sulphur inhibited additional vegetation from growing and the topsoil consequently washed off the hilly terrain due to lack of vegetation to hold it though acid plants were later built to convert the sulphur into a useful product the result of the earlier activities was that for years up until the 1980s the area was denuded of any greenery and the red clay soil remaining gave it a martian appearance the area has now been greatly reforested due to a multimillion dollar effort by the successor companies to the original copper company the copper and acid plants have been permanently closed and most of the plant infrastructure already removed and sold overseas much of the scrap metals from the site have been removed and sold to china

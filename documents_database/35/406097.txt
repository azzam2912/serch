food is directed into the cytostome and sealed into vacuoles only certain groups of protozoa such as the ciliophora and excavata have cytostomes an example is balantidium coli a ciliate in other protozoa and in cells from multicellular organisms phagocytosis takes place at any point on the cell or feeding takes place by absorption the cytostome forms an invagination on the cell surface and is typically directed towards the nucleus of the cell the cytostome is often labeled as the entire invagination but in fact the cytostome only constitutes the opening of the invagination at the surface of the cell the rest of the invagination is classified as the cytopharynx the cytopharynx works in conjunction with the cytostome in order to import macromolecules into the cell this strong association between the cytostome and cytopharynx is often called the cytostome cytopharynx complex or the cytopharyngeal apparatus however in a small number of cases the cytostome works independently in order to import macromolecules in these instances the cytostome imports macromolecules by directly forming vesicles that are imported into the interior of the cell the cytostome is associated with microtubules that function in maintaining its form one set of microtubules is arranged in

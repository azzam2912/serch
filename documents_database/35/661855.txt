these components allow for the design and deployment of next generation networking systems that can make packet or message processing decisions based on an awareness of the packet or message content the work of content processors is often termed content processing or deep packet inspection dpi though some people feel that the expression dpi is too limiting as many content processors can modify and re write content on the fly therefore they can do much more than just inspect which implies a sort of monitoring only function unlike knowledge based processors or ternary content addressable memory tcams which mainly target the packet header twenty percent of the packet currently comprises the header content processors go much further into the packet or message thereby determining the nature of the content in the packet itself 80 of the packet currently is data applications of content processors include layer 7 application application oriented networks switches routers unified threat management utm computer appliances intrusion detection prevention systems ids ips anti virus compliance voip and xml gateways the various layers of the osi model are given in the link that follows with a description of layer 7 where content processing is and will become and

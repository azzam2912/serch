comparators are used in central processing unit s cpus and microcontrollers mcus examples of digital comparator include the cmos 4063 and 4585 and the ttl 7485 and 74682 note an xnor gate is a basic comparator because its output is 1 only if its two input bits are equal the analog equivalent of digital comparator is the voltage comparator many microcontrollers have analog comparators on some of their inputs that can be read or trigger an interrupt consider two 4 bit binary numbers a and b so formula 1 formula 2 here each subscript represents one of the digits in the numbers the binary numbers a and b will be equal if all the pairs of significant digits of both numbers are equal i e formula 3 formula 4 formula 5 and formula 6 since the numbers are binary the digits are either 0 or 1 and the boolean function for equality of any two digits formula 7 and formula 8 can be expressed as formula 9 we can also replace it by xnor gate in digital electronics formula 10 is 1 only if formula 7 and formula 8 are equal for the equality of a and b all formula

fumarase comes in two forms mitochondrial and cytosolic the mitochondrial isoenzyme is involved in the krebs cycle also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca or the citric acid cycle and the cytosolic isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of amino acids and fumarate subcellular localization is established by the presence of a signal sequence on the amino terminus in the mitochondrial form while subcellular localization in the cytosolic form is established by the absence of the signal sequence found in the mitochondrial variety this enzyme participates in 2 metabolic pathways citric acid cycle reductive citric acid cycle co fixation and is also important in renal cell carcinoma mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of leiomyomas in the skin and uterus in combination with renal cell carcinoma this enzyme belongs to the family of lyases specifically the hydro lyases which cleave carbon oxygen bonds the systematic name of this enzyme class is s malate hydro lyase fumarate forming other names in common use include the fh gene is localized to the chromosomal position 1q42 3 q43 the fh gene contains 10 exons crystal structures of fumarase c from escherichia coli have been observed to have two

for water depths deeper than the wave base bottom sediments and the seafloor are no longer stirred by the wave motion above in seawater the water particles are moved in a circular orbital motion when a wave passes the radius of the circle of motion for any given water molecule decreases exponentially with increasing depth the wave base which is the depth of influence of a water wave is about half the wavelength at depths greater than half the wavelength the water motion is less than 4 of its value at the water surface and may be neglected for example in a pool of water deep a wave with a wavelength would be moving the water at the bottom in the same pool a wave with a wavelength of would not be able to cause water movement on the bottom there are typically two wave bases the fair weather wave base fwwb and the storm wave base swb the fair weather wave base refers to the depth beneath the waves under normal conditions and the portion of the seafloor that is agitated by this everyday wave action is known as the upper shoreface the storm wave base refers to the

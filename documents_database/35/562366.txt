in particular the idea that mass energy generates curvature in space and that curvature affects the motion of masses can be illustrated in a newtonian setting we use circular orbits as our prototype this has the advantage that we know the kinetics of circular orbits this allows us to calculate curvature of orbits in space directly and compare the results with dynamical forces a unique feature of the gravitational force is that all massive objects accelerate in the same manner in a gravitational field this is often expressed as the gravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass this allows us to think of gravity as a curvature of spacetime if initially parallel paths of two particles on nearby geodesics remain parallel within some accuracy then spacetime is flat to within that accuracy ref 2 p 30 consider the situation in which there are two particles in nearby circular polar orbits of the earth at radius formula 1 and speed formula 2 since the orbits are circular the gravitational force on the particles must equal the centripetal force where g is the gravitational constant and formula 4 is the mass of the earth the particles execute simple harmonic motion about

all known specimens come from the jiufotang formation and yixian formation dating to the early aptian age 125 120 million years ago longipterygids are characterized by an extremely long toothed snout making up over 60 of the total skull length in which the teeth are restricted to the tips of the jaws the snouts were straight but slightly concave at a point behind the nostrils and the bones of the snout tip were solid their pygostyles the series of fused vertebrae in the tail were unusually large and longer than the foot bones the feet of longipterygids were also specialized relative to other enantiornithes where most enantiornithes had a long middle toe with a knuckle trochlea that extended beyond the outer two the toes of longipterygids were even in length and attached to the rest of the foot at the same level this configuration is also seen in some groups of modern birds and is usually considered an adaptation for advanced perching ability it is likely that longipteryigids lived primarily in trees because their long jaws tipped with large often curved teeth are usually considered an adaptation for catching and eating fish it is likely that they were similar in

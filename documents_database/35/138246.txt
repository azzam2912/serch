he is best known for his discovery of the positron in 1932 an achievement for which he received the 1936 nobel prize in physics and of the muon in 1936 anderson was born in new york city the son of swedish immigrants he studied physics and engineering at caltech b s 1927 ph d 1930 under the supervision of robert a millikan he began investigations into cosmic rays during the course of which he encountered unexpected particle tracks in his modern versions now commonly referred to as an anderson cloud chamber photographs that he correctly interpreted as having been created by a particle with the same mass as the electron but with opposite electrical charge this discovery announced in 1932 and later confirmed by others validated paul dirac s theoretical prediction of the existence of the positron anderson first detected the particles in cosmic rays he then produced more conclusive proof by shooting gamma rays produced by the natural radioactive nuclide thc tl into other materials resulting in the creation of positron electron pairs for this work anderson shared the 1936 nobel prize in physics with victor hess fifty years later anderson acknowledged that his discovery was inspired by the

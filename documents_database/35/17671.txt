lawrence in 1929 1930 at the university of california berkeley and patented in 1932 a cyclotron accelerates charged particles outwards from the center along a spiral path the particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a static magnetic field and accelerated by a rapidly varying radio frequency electric field lawrence was awarded the 1939 nobel prize in physics for this invention cyclotrons were the most powerful particle accelerator technology until the 1950s when they were superseded by the synchrotron and are still used to produce particle beams in physics and nuclear medicine the largest single magnet cyclotron was the synchrocyclotron built between 1940 and 1946 by lawrence at the university of california berkeley which could accelerate protons to 730 mega electron volts mev the largest cyclotron is the multimagnet triumf accelerator at the university of british columbia in vancouver british columbia which can produce 500 mev protons over 1200 cyclotrons are used in nuclear medicine worldwide for the production of radionuclides the first cyclotron was developed and patented by ernest lawrence in 1932 at the university of california berkeley he used large electromagnets recycled from obsolete poulsen arc radio transmitters provided by the federal telegraph company a graduate student

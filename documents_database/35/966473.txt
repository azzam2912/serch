this contrasts with the traditional approach in which taxon names are defined by a type which can be a specimen or a taxon of lower rank and a description in words phylogenetic nomenclature is currently not regulated but the international code of phylogenetic nomenclature phylocode is intended to regulate it once it is ratified phylogenetic nomenclature ties names to clades groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants these groups can equivalently be called monophyletic there are slightly different ways of specifying the ancestor which are discussed below once the ancestor is specified the meaning of the name is fixed the ancestor and all organisms which are its descendants are included in the named taxon listing all these organisms i e providing a full circumscription requires the full phylogenetic tree to be known in practice there are only one or more hypotheses as to the correct tree different hypotheses lead to different organisms being thought to be included in the named taxon but do not affect what organisms the name actually applies to in this sense the name is independent of theory revision phylogenetic nomenclature ties names to clades groups consisting solely of an ancestor and all its descendants

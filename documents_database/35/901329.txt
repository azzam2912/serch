this section will outline the use of the fritsch carlson method note that only one pass of the algorithm is required let the data points be formula 2 indexed in sorted order for formula 3 after the preprocessing above evaluation of the interpolated spline is equivalent to cubic hermite spline using the data formula 37 formula 38 and formula 39 for formula 3 to evaluate at formula 41 find the index formula 42 in the sequence where formula 41 lies between formula 37 and formula 45 that is formula 46 calculate then the interpolated value is where formula 49 are the basis functions for the cubic hermite spline the following javascript implementation takes a data set and produces a monotone cubic spline interpolant function monotone cubic spline interpolation var createinterpolant function xs ys

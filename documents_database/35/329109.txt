accent was developed as a follow on to the aleph kernel developed at the university of rochester fixing several of its problems and re targeting its hardware support for networks of workstation machines specifically the three rivers perq instead of minicomputers accent was part of the spice project at cmu which ran from 1981 to 1985 development of accent led directly to the famous mach kernel the original aleph project used data copying to allow programs to communicate applications could open ports which would allow them to receive data sent to them by other programs the idea was to write a number of servers that would control resources on the machine passing data along until it reached an end user in this respect it was similar in concept to unix although the implementation was much different using messages instead of memory this turned out to have a number of problems notably that copying memory on their data general eclipse was very expensive in 1979 one of the aleph engineers richard rashid left for cmu and started work on a new version of aleph that avoided its problems in particular accent targeted workstation machines featuring a mmu using the mmu to

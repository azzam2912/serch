it integrates main propulsion rcs and attitude control in a single system pressure fed from a common dual string redundant pressurized propellant system the common propellant is udmh and no and the main propulsion unit is the s5 80 main engine it generates of thrust with a chamber pressure of and a nozzle expansion of 153 8 that enables it to achieve a specific impulse of it is rated for 30 starts with a total firing time of 890 seconds the integrated system without the pressurization nor tanks weighs and is an integrated unit that is long with a diameter of the ktdu 80 system integrates a dual string redundant propellant and pressurization system a main propulsion system the skd an rcs the dpo b and an attitude control system the dpo m all the propulsion elements are pressure fed rocket engines burning udmh and no with a common supply of pressurized propellant mechanically the ktdu 80 is separated in two sections each subsystem is describe in the following sections the pneumatic pressurization system has three main functions the system has four spherical pressurizing gas tanks in two separated circuits each circuit connects two tanks and has its individual pressure

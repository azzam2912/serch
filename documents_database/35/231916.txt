their general form is where m is the applied torques i is the inertia matrix and is the angular velocity about the principal axes in three dimensional principal orthogonal coordinates they become where m are the components of the applied torques i are the principal moments of inertia and are the components of the angular velocity about the principal axes starting from newton s second law in an inertial frame of reference subscripted in the time derivative of the angular momentum l equals the applied torque where i is the moment of inertia tensor calculated in the inertial frame although this law is universally true it is not always helpful in solving for the motion of a general rotating rigid body since both i and can change during the motion therefore we change to a coordinate frame fixed in the rotating body and chosen so that its axes are aligned with the principal axes of the moment of inertia tensor in this frame at least the moment of inertia tensor is constant and diagonal which simplifies calculations as described in the moment of inertia the angular momentum l can be written where m i and are as above in a

the formation of ice in clouds is required for snow and most rainfall dust and soot particles can serve as ice nuclei but biological ice nuclei are capable of catalyzing freezing at much warmer temperatures the ice nucleating bacteria currently known are mostly plant pathogens recent research suggests that bacteria may be present in clouds as part of an evolved process of dispersal ice nucleating proteins derived from ice nucleating bacteria are used for snowmaking most known ice nucleating bacteria are plant pathogens these pathogens can cause freezing injury in plants in the united states alone it has been estimated that frost accounts for approximately 1 billion in crop damage each year the ice minus variant of p syringae is a mutant lacking the gene responsible for ice nucleating surface protein production this lack of surface protein provides a less favorable environment for ice formation both strains of p syringae occur naturally but recombinant dna technology has allowed for the synthetic removal or alteration of specific genes enabling the creation of the ice minus strain the introduction of an ice minus strain of p syringae to the surface of plants would incur competition between the strains should the ice minus

the buddha is depicted in the position of the dhyana mudra the posture of meditation associated with his first enlightenment this statue is 7 feet 3 inches in height and carved from dolomite marble it was found in 1886 at mahamevn wa park it is similar to the toluvila statue from the same period it is similar to gupta period buddha images it is believed that originally the image was gilded and had inlaid eyes made of precious gems it is likely that it was one of the four statues around a sacred bodhi tree shrine this is the only one that has survived largely intact whether the buddha s enlightenment was the experience technically called samadhi or some other phenomenon may depend upon the philosophical allegiance of the believer in the dhyana mudra the buddha sits cross legged with his upturned palms placed one over the other on his lap this position is universally known throughout the buddhist world and this statue is therefore one of the most typical pieces of buddhist sculpture it is not to be confused with the very similar earth touching mudra which depicts the simple action the buddha took to fend off the illusions

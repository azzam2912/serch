the long run cost curve is a cost function that models this minimum cost over time meaning inputs are not fixed using the long run cost curve firms can scale their means of production to reduce the costs of producing the good there are three principal cost functions or curves used in microeconomic analysis the idealized long run for a firm refers to the absence of time based restrictions on what inputs such as factors of production a firm can employ in its production technology for example a firm cannot build an additional factory in the short run but this restriction does not apply in the long run because forecasting introduces complexity firms typically assume that the long run costs are based on the technology information and prices that the firm faces currently the long run cost curve does not try to anticipate changes in the firm the technology or the industry it only reflects how costs would be different if there were no constraints on changing the inputs in the current period an ideal cost curve assumes technical efficiency because a firm always has an incentive to be as technically efficient as possible firms have a variety of methods

he is a professor and head of the department of cell biology at the erasmus mc rotterdam he obtained his phd degree from mcgill university montreal and after completing two postdoctoral periods with charles weissmann zurich and richard flavell amsterdam and london he started his own research group at the national institute for medical research mill hill grosveld has been conducting research on the regulation of gene expression over thirty years in his post doctoral research he constructed the first reliable method for cloning human dna cosmids at the time an extremely difficult but rewarding accomplishment that has since been adopted by many other laboratories by using the globin gene cluster he made the ground breaking discovery of a locus control region located upstream of the gene itself and governing overall control of globin gene expression after this first report locus control regions have now been identified for many genes and have permitted for example the ectopic expression of genes in transgenic mice in further studies he identified chromatin loops and the hubs that hold the loops together his more recent excursions into erythroid differentiation have made the key identification of the transcription factor gata1 a major and unique advance

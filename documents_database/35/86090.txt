a beneficial feature is that in some metals the plastic flow reduces surface grain size and work hardens the surface while the material deeper in the part retains its toughness and ductility the term comes from the initial use of the process manufacturing of coins coining is used to manufacture parts for all industries and is commonly used when high relief or very fine features are required for example it is used to produce coins badges buttons precision energy springs and precision parts with small or polished surface features coining is a cold working process similar in other respects to forging which takes place at elevated temperature it uses a great deal of force to plastically deform a workpiece so that it conforms to a die coining can be done using a gear driven press a mechanical press or more commonly a hydraulically actuated press coining typically requires higher tonnage presses than stamping because the workpiece is plastically deformed and not actually cut as in some other forms of stamping the coining process is preferred when there is a high tonnage in soldering of electronic components bumps are formed on bonding pads to enhance adhesion which are further flattened by

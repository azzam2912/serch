it is defined as 0 1 to 10 thz wavelengths of 3 mm to 30 m currently at frequencies within this range useful power generation and receiver technologies are inefficient and impractical mass production of devices in this range and operation at room temperature at which kt is equal to the energy of a photon with a frequency of 6 2 thz are mostly unfeasible this leaves a gap between mature microwave technologies in the highest frequencies of the radio spectrum and the well developed optical engineering of infrared detectors in their lowest frequencies this radiation is mostly used in small scale specialized applications such as submillimetre astronomy research that attempts to resolve this issue has been conducted since the late 20th century ongoing investigation has resulted in improved emitters sources and detectors and research in this area has intensified however drawbacks remain that include the substantial size of emitters incompatible frequency ranges and undesirable operating temperatures as well as component device and detector requirements that are somewhere between solid state electronics and photonic technologies free electron lasers can generate a wide range of stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation from microwaves through terahertz radiation to x ray however they are

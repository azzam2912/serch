the processing areas airlock and laboratories were designed to support non hazardous station and space shuttle payloads in 100 000 class clean work areas regarding the launch of modules of the international space station iss there had been philosophical differences for years between designers and payload processors whether to ship and shoot or perform integration testing prior to launch the former involved building a station module and launching it without ever physically testing it with other modules the integration testing was not originally in the iss plan but in 1995 johnson space center designers began to consider it and embedding ksc personnel at module factories multi element integration testing meit of iss modules at ksc was officially in the books in 1997 three meit and one integration systems test ist tests were conducted for the iss taking about three years from planning to completion and closure after the launch of the destiny an emulator was built for meit testing since the lab controlled many other modules among the items checked were mechanical connections the ability to flow power and fluids between modules and the flight software numerous issues were found from these on the ground tests many of which could

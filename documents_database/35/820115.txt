the railway was built to the track gauge of 4 ft 6 in 1 372 mm on stone block sleepers the line opened in 1837 and used locomotive power at first its operating costs were much higher than expected and its income was disappointing and horse traction was used to save expenditure the company sold its line to the glasgow paisley kilmarnock and ayr railway in 1847 but horse traction continued until 1866 when a connecting curve to the main line was opened and through trains between renfrew and glasgow operated never a flourishing line it closed to passengers in 1967 and to goods traffic in 1981 paisley was an important burgh at the beginning of the nineteenth century and most passenger and goods journeys involved a passage along the river clyde followed by the tedious and slow negotiation of the river cart this was such an obstruction that local promoters decided to construct a railway between renfrew wharf and the centre of paisley they employed the engineers thomas grainger and john miller who had successfully designed several coal lines in the west of scotland and elsewhere the line was authorised by act of parliament on 21 july 1835 robertson

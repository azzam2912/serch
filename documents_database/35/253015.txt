it was a small spheroidal satellite designed to study trapped radiation of various energies galactic cosmic rays geomagnetism radio propagation in the upper atmosphere and the flux of micrometeorites it also tested a scanning device designed for photographing the earth s cloud cover and transmitted the first pictures of earth via satellite the satellite was launched into a highly elliptical orbit with an initial local time of apogee of 2100 h the satellite was spin stabilized at 2 8 rps with the direction of the spin axis having a right ascension of 217 degrees and a declination of 23 degrees four solar cell paddles mounted near its equator recharged the storage batteries while in orbit each experiment except the television scanner had two outputs digital and analog a uhf transmitter was used for the digital telemetry and the tv signal two vhf transmitters were used to transmit the analog signal the vhf transmitters were operated continuously the uhf transmitter was operated for only a few hours each day only three of the solar cell paddles fully erected and this occurred during spin up rather than prior to spin up as planned consequently initial operation of the payload power supply was

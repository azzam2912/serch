it has been misclassified for many years but with improvement of molecular techniques its phylogenetic classification has been established many methods exist to identify m mycetomatis both in lesions and in culture histological examination is especially useful as it has many unique morphological features strain level differences in response to antifungal agents is informative for treatment and laboratory isolation of cultures madurella mycetomatis underwent many name changes in 1901 brumpt described the first recorded case of mycosis caused by m mycetomatis identifying black granules in association with mycetoma in 1902 laveran named the fungus strepthothrix mycetomi which he had identified from a mycetoma grain in 1905 brumpt corrected its genus to madurella in turn changing its name to madurella mycetomi the fungus was grown in vitro by brault in 1912 so it could be studied in culture in 1977 the british medical research council changed the name to the currently accepted name madurella mycetomatis with the binomial name determined m mycetomatis still remained incorrectly classified in the pleosporales this error was eventually corrected and m mycetomatis was placed in the sordariales order the genus madurella contains only two well defined species m mycetomatis and m grisea roughly a dozen other

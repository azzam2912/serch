rrm involves strategies and algorithms for controlling parameters such as transmit power user allocation beamforming data rates handover criteria modulation scheme error coding scheme etc the objective is to utilize the limited radio frequency spectrum resources and radio network infrastructure as efficiently as possible rrm concerns multi user and multi cell network capacity issues rather than the point to point channel capacity traditional telecommunications research and education often dwell upon channel coding and source coding with a single user in mind although it may not be possible to achieve the maximum channel capacity when several users and adjacent base stations share the same frequency channel efficient dynamic rrm schemes may increase the system spectral efficiency by an order of magnitude which often is considerably more than what is possible by introducing advanced channel coding and source coding schemes rrm is especially important in systems limited by co channel interference rather than by noise for example cellular systems and broadcast networks homogeneously covering large areas and wireless networks consisting of many adjacent access points that may reuse the same channel frequencies the cost for deploying a wireless network is normally dominated by base station sites real estate costs planning maintenance distribution

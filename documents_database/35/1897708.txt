surfaces are prone to contamination which is a phenomenon known as fouling unwanted adsorbates caused by fouling change the properties of a surface which is often counter productive to the function of that surface consequently a necessity for anti fouling surfaces has arisen in many fields blocked pipes inhibit factory productivity biofouling increases fuel consumption on ships medical devices must be kept sanitary etc although chemical fouling inhibitors metallic coatings and cleaning processes can be used to reduce fouling non toxic surfaces with anti fouling properties are ideal for fouling prevention to be considered effective an ultra low fouling surface must be able repel and withstand the accumulation of detrimental aggregates down to less than 5 ng cm a recent surge of research has been conducted to create these surfaces in order to benefit the biological nautical mechanical and medical fields high surface energies cause adsorption because a contaminated surface will have a smaller difference between the surface and bulk coordination numbers this drives the surface to reach a lower more favored energy state a low energy surface would then be desired to prevent adsorption it would be convenient if the desired surface was already low energy but in many

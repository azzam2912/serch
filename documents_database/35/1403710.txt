despite their high toxicity organogallium compounds have some use in organic synthesis the compound trimethylgallium is of some relevance to mocvd as a precursor to gallium arsenide via its reaction with arsine at 700 c gallium trichloride is an important reagent for the introduction of gallium into organic compounds the main gallium oxidation state is ga iii as in all lower group 13 elements such as aluminium compounds of the type rga are monomeric lewis acidity decreases in the order al ga in and as a result organogallium compounds do not form bridged dimers as organoaluminum compounds do organogallium compounds are also less reactive than organoaluminum compounds they do form stable peroxides organogallium compounds can be synthesized by transmetallation for example the reaction of gallium metal with dimethylmercury or via organolithium compounds or grignards the electron deficient nature of gallium can be removed by complex formation for example pi complex formation with alkynes is also known organogallium compounds are reagents or intermediates in several classes of organic reactions the chemistry of organoindium in and organothallium tl compounds parallel that of organogallium in many regards indium and thallium in oxidation state 1 are more common for example the metallocenes cyclopentadienylindium i

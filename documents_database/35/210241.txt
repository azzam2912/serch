high permeability will allow fluids to move rapidly through rocks permeability is affected by the pressure in a rock the unit of measure is called the darcy named after henry darcy 1803 1858 sandstones may vary in permeability from less than one to over 50 000 millidarcys md permeabilities are more commonly in the range of tens to hundreds of millidarcies a rock with 25 porosity and a permeability of 1 md will not yield a significant flow of water such tight rocks are usually artificially stimulated fractured or acidized to create permeability and yield a flow the si unit for permeability is m a practical unit for permeability is the darcy d or more commonly the millidarcy md 1 darcy formula 110m the name honors the french engineer henry darcy who first described the flow of water through sand filters for potable water supply permeability values for sandstones range typically from a fraction of a darcy to several darcys the unit of cm is also sometimes used 1 cm 10 m formula 1 10 d the concept of permeability is of importance in determining the flow characteristics of hydrocarbons in oil and gas reservoirs and of groundwater in aquifers

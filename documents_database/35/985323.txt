1996 ibis was designed to explicitly link land surface and hydrological processes terrestrial biogeochemical cycles and vegetation dynamics within a single physically consistent framework the model considers transient changes in vegetation composition and structure in response to environmental change and is therefore classified as a dynamic global vegetation model dgvm this new version of ibis has improved representations of land surface physics plant physiology canopy phenology plant functional type pft differences and carbon allocation furthermore ibis 2 includes a new belowground biogeochemistry submodel which is coupled to detritus production litterfall and fine root turnover all process are organized in a hierarchical framework and operate at different time steps ranging from 60 min to 1 year such an approach allows for explicit coupling among ecological biophysical and physiological processes occurring on different timescales the land surface module is based on the land surface transfer model lsx package of thompson and pollard and simulates the energy water carbon and momentum balance of the soil vegetation atmosphere system the model represents two vegetation canopies e g trees versus shrubs and grasses eight soil layers and three layers of snow when required the solar radiative transfer scheme of ibis 2 has been simplified in

in effect the mains hum signal is treated as if it were a time dependent digital watermark that can help identify when the recording was created and help detect any edits in the recording historical records of mains frequency changes are kept on record e g by police in the german federal state of bavaria since 2010 the technology has been hailed as the most significant development in audio forensics since watergate however according to a paper by huijbregtse and geradts the enf technique although powerful has significant limitations caused by ambiguity based on fixed frequency offsets during recording and self similarity within the mains frequency database particularly for recordings shorter than 10 minutes more recently researchers demonstrated that indoor lights such as fluorescent lights and incandescent bulbs vary their light intensity in accordance with the voltage supplied which in turn depends on the voltage supply frequency as a result the light intensity can carry the frequency fluctuation information to the visual sensor recordings in a similar way as the electromagnetic waves from the power transmission lines carry the enf information to audio sensing mechanisms based on this result researchers demonstrated that visual track from still video taken in indoor

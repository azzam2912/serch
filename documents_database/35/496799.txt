dynamic scoring depends on models of the behavior of economic agents which predict how they would react once the tax rate or other policy change goes into effect this means the uncertainty induced in predictions is greater to the degree that the proposed policy is unlike current policy unfortunately any such model depends heavily on judgment and there is no evidence that it is more effective or accurate for example a dynamic scoring model may include econometric model of a transitional phase as the population adapts to the new policy rather than the so called static scoring alternative of standard assumption about behavior of people being immediately and directly sensitive to prices the outcome of the dynamic analysis is therefore heavily dependent on assumptions about future behaviors and rates of change the dynamic analysis is potentially more accurate than the alternative if the econometric model correctly captures how households and firms will react to a policy changes this has been attacked as assumption driven compared to static scoring which makes simpler assumptions about behavior change due to the introduction of a new policy using dynamic scoring has been promoted by republican legislators to argue that supply side tax policy for

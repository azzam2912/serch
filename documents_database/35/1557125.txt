like other members of the genus potyvirus pwv is a monopartite strand of positive sense single stranded rna surrounded by a capsid made for a single viral encoded protein the virus is a filamentous particle that measures about 745 nm in length this virus is transmitted by at least two species of aphids myzus persicae and aphis gossypii in a non persistent manner and by mechanical inoculation there is no evidence that this virus is transmitted in the seed like other potyviruses this virus produces viral inclusions called cylindrical inclusions these inclusions can be diagnostic in passiflora spp see external links this virus was named for the symptoms seen in the fruit of infected p edulis plants the fruit can be distorted in appearance and the edible part of the fruit becomes thick and hard or woody the virus induces a severe mosaic with rugosity and chlorotic ringspots in the leaves of p edulis infected plants grow less vigorously and have a shorter life span than those without the virus infection because of its effect on the fruit and plant growth pwv is considered one of the most economically important of the many viruses that have been found infecting passiflora

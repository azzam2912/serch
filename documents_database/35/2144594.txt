its advantage over the classical tensorial constitutive models is that it can capture the oriented nature of damage such as tensile cracking slip friction and compression splitting as well as the orientation of fiber reinforcement another advantage is that the anisotropy of materials such as gas shale or fiber composites can be effectively represented to prevent unstable strain localization and spurious mesh sensitivity in finite element computations this model must be used in combination with some nonlocal continuum formulation e g the crack band model prior to 2000 these advantages were outweighed by greater computational demands of the material subroutine but thanks to huge increase of computer power the microplane model is now routinely used in computer programs even with tens of millions of finite elements the basic idea of the microplane model is to express the constitutive law not in terms of tensors but in terms of the vectors of stress and strain acting on planes of various orientations called the microplanes the use of vectors was inspired by g i taylor s idea in 1938 which led to taylor models for plasticity of polycrystalline metals but the microplane models differ conceptually in two ways firstly to prevent model

this was proven to be possible by mikl s laczkovich in 1990 the decomposition makes heavy use of the axiom of choice and is therefore non constructive laczkovich estimated the number of pieces in his decomposition at roughly 10 more recently in 2017 andrew marks and spencer unger gave a completely constructive solution using borel pieces in particular it is impossible to dissect a circle and make a square using pieces that could be cut with an idealized pair of scissors that is having jordan curve boundary the pieces used in laczkovich s proof are non measurable subsets laczkovich actually proved the reassembly can be done using translations only rotations are not required along the way he also proved that any simple polygon in the plane can be decomposed into finitely many pieces and reassembled using translations only to form a square of equal area the bolyai gerwien theorem is a related but much simpler result it states that one can accomplish such a decomposition of a simple polygon with finitely many polygonal pieces if both translations and rotations are allowed for the reassembly it follows from a result of that it is possible to choose the pieces in such

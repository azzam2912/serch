they are used by releasing the pft at a certain point and determining the concentration of that pft at another set of points allowing the flow from the source to the points to be determined pfts are believed non toxic and chemically inert clear colourless liquids they are non flammable and are not radioactive they do not occur in nature at all so background levels are very low but they can be detected at extremely low concentrations there is a range of pfts available commercially allowing the experimenter to release different pfts at the same time cyclic perfluorocarbons such as perfluoromethylhexane and perfluoro 1 3 dimethylcyclohexane are generally believed to be better than acyclic ones as they can be detected at lower levels the pft can be released in a variety of ways depending on the application and may be as simple as spraying into the air samples are then collected at set times and locations and either taken to a laboratory for analysis or analysed in the field analysis of the samples typically involves three parts preparation chromatography and detection preparation involves removal of other impuries for example mixing with hydrogen then passing over a catalyst to convert oxygen

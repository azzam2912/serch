in short this means crowdsourcing of sensor data from mobile devices devices equipped with various sensors have become ubiquitous most smartphones can sense ambient light noise through the microphone location through the gps movement through the accelerometer and more these sensors can collect vast quantities of data that are useful in a variety of ways for example gps and accelerometer data can be used to locate potholes in cities and microphones can be used with gps to map noise pollution the term mobile crowdsensing was coined by raghu ganti fan ye and hui lei in 2011 mobile crowdsensing belongs to three main types environmental such as monitoring pollution infrastructure such as locating potholes and social such as tracking exercise data within a community current crowdsensing applications operate based on the assumption that all users voluntarily submit the sensing data leading to extensive user participation it can also indicate the way mobile device users form microcrowds based on a specific crowdsensing activity based on the type of involvement from the users mobile crowdsensing can be classified into two types taking advantage of the ubiquitous presence of powerful mobile computing devices especially smartphones in the recent years it has become an appealing

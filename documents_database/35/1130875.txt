as one of the checkpoint proteins bub3 delays the irreversible onset of anaphase through direction of kinetochore localization during prometaphase to achieve biorentation in directing the kinetochore microtubule interaction this ensures the proper and consequenctly bioriented attachment of the chromosomes prior to anaphase bub3 and its related proteins that form the spindle assembly checkpoint sac inhibit the action of the anaphase promoting complex apc preventing early anaphase entry and mitotic exit this serves as a mechanism for the fidelity of chromosomal segregation bub3 is a crucial component in the formation of the mitotic spindle assembly complex which forms a complex with other important proteins for correct segregation of the cells it is necessary for all mitotic spindles to attach correctly to the kinetochore of each chromosome this is controlled by the mitotic spindle checkpoint complex which operates as a feedback response if there is a signal of a defect in the attachment mitosis will be stopped to ensure that all chromosomes have an amphitelic binding to spindles after the error is corrected the cell will proceed to anaphase the complex of proteins which regulate the cell arrest are bub1 bub2 bub3 this protein mad1 mad2 mad3 and mps1 at unattached

these pixels are connected horizontally and vertically in terms of pixel coordinates every pixel that has the coordinates is connected to the pixel at formula 3 6 connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their corners which includes pixels that touch one of their edges in a hexagonal grid or stretcher bond rectangular grid there are several ways to map hexagonal tiles to integer pixel coordinates with one method in addition to the 4 connected pixels the two pixels at coordinates formula 4 and formula 5 are connected to the pixel at formula 6 8 connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their edges or corners these pixels are connected horizontally vertically and diagonally in addition to 4 connected pixels each pixel with coordinates formula 7 is connected to the pixel at formula 6 6 connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their faces these pixels are connected along one of the primary axes each pixel with coordinates formula 9 formula 10 or formula 11 is connected to the pixel at formula 12 18 connected pixels are neighbors to every pixel that touches one of their faces or

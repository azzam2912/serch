the height of curvature is the same as the height of contour the buccal and lingual contours of a tooth are important in determining the angle at which food is deflected from a tooth surface if food is deflected too much some of the gingiva would not have the right amount of stimulation on the other hand if food is deflected too little some of it would be forced into the space which separates the tooth from the gingiva consequences of this could be inflammation of the gingiva or periodontal disease in young people the buccal and lingual curvatures lie below the gum as the teeth have not fully erupted however as tooth eruption progresses the curvature is easier to see the shape of the crown of a tooth helps to prevent periodontal disease it does this by allowing food to be deflected onto the gums at a specific angle so that the gum tissue can be stimulated and cleaned each tooth is shaped so that food is directed off the tooth and onto the gums instead the shape of the tooth is also designed specifically for its function and to allow for its self cleaning ability the proximal contact

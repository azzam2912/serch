it derives from the ecobalance and has the ambition to analyze and verify the emergence transformation and use of energy resources in an organization in detail energy balances serve as a major statistical data base for energy policy and energy management decisions they contain important information such as the amount and composition of energy consumption its changes or the transformation of energy many countries publish statistics on the energy supply from their own country or from other countries or the world world energy balances is published by one of the largest organizations in this field the international energy agency iea see further worldwide energy supply the basic idea of a balance is that nothing can get lost or annihilated this fits to the first law of thermodynamics which assigns energy this property but energy splits up during usage and its output does not have the same potential for the physical performance as before for this reason it is important to distinguish between input and output of energy usage the input side can easily be measured with the help of the meter readings but on the output side there may be effects that are difficulty predictable such as heat dust or

since the mid 20th century the term dynamics or analytical dynamics has largely superseded kinetics in physics textbooks though the term is still used in engineering in plasma physics kinetics refers to the study of continua in velocity space this is usually in the context of non thermal non maxwellian velocity distributions or processes that perturb thermal distributions these kinetic plasmas cannot be adequately described with fluid equations one of the major components of kinetics is analyzing ones center of pressure center of pressure cop is often tested using a force plate in a biomechanics lab many scientists don t always have access to these expensive and unique equipment force plates can be any from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars scientist and students today have turned to an alternative way by using nintendo wii balance board system as a force plate one 2014 san diego state university study has shown a correlation of formula 1 for the center of pressure measured using the balance board compared to a gold standard measure the students expect their results to find that ankle bracing will reduce sway and decrease ankle instability and falls postural sway is the measurement of the time

frozen precipitation melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below if the precipitate refreezes while still in the air it will land on the ground as sleet alternatively the liquid droplets can continue to fall without freezing passing through the cold air just above the surface this thin layer of air then cools the rain to a temperature below freezing however the drops themselves do not freeze a phenomenon called supercooling or forming supercooled drops when the supercooled drops strike ground or anything else below e g power lines tree branches aircraft a layer of ice accumulates as the cold water drips off forming a slowly thickening film of ice hence freezing rain while meteorologists can predict when and where an ice storm will occur some storms still occur with little or no warning in the united states most ice storms are in the northeastern part of the country but damaging storms have occurred farther south an ice storm in february 1994 resulted in tremendous ice accumulation as far south as mississippi and caused reported damage in nine states more timber was damaged than that caused by hurricane

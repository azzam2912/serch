these coefficients are variance components that are uniquely explained by each independent variable i e unique effects and variance components that are shared in each possible combination of the independent variables i e common effects these commonality coefficients sum up to the total variance explained model r of all the independent variables on the dependent variable commonality analysis produces commonality coefficients where k is the number of the independent variables as an illustrative example in the case of three independent variables a b and c commonality returns 7 coefficients the unique coefficient indicates to which degree the variable is independently associated with the dependent variable positive commonality coefficients indicate that a part of the explained variance of the dependent variable is shared between independent variables negative commonality coefficients indicate that there is a suppressor effects between independent variables the calculation of commonality coefficients can be done in principle with any software that calculates r e g in spss see however this becomes quickly burdensome as number of independent variable increases for example with 10 independent variables there are commonality coefficients to be calculated the yhat package in r can be used to calculate commonality coefficients and to produce bootstrapped confidence

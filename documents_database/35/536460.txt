the process was invented by irving langmuir in the course of his studies of atomic hydrogen the electric arc efficiently breaks up the hydrogen molecules which later recombine with tremendous release of heat reaching temperatures from 3400 to 4000 c without the arc an oxyhydrogen torch can only reach 2800 c this is the third hottest flame after dicyanoacetylene at 4987 c and cyanogen at 4525 c an acetylene torch merely reaches 3300 c this device may be called an atomic hydrogen torch nascent hydrogen torch or langmuir torch the process was also known as arc atom welding the heat produced by this torch is sufficient to weld tungsten 3422 c the most refractory metal the presence of hydrogen also acts as a shielding gas preventing oxidation and contamination by carbon nitrogen or oxygen which can severely damage the properties of many metals it eliminates the need of flux for this purpose the arc is maintained independently of the workpiece or parts being welded the hydrogen gas is normally diatomic h but where the temperatures are over near the arc the hydrogen breaks down into its atomic form absorbing a large amount of heat from the arc when the hydrogen

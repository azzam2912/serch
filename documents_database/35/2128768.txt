monosemy as a methodology for analysis is based on the recognition that almost all cases of polysemy where a word is understood to have multiple meanings require context in order to differentiate these supposed meanings since context is an indispensable part of any polysemous meaning ruhl argues that it is better to locate the variation in meaning where it actually resides in the context and not in the word itself wallis reid has demonstrated that a polysemous definition does not actually add any additional information that is not already located in the context such that a polysemous definition is exactly as informative as a monosemous definition when the effects of context are controlled for i e systematically factored out of a definition a monosemous analysis assumes that any sign in a sign system signals one value within its paradigm with a substance that arises out of its diachronic history there are some cases where a word genuinely has two meanings that cannot be brought under a singular more abstract sense but these are better understood as instances of homonymy monosemy has been used in work by the columbia school of linguistics in areas of cognitive linguistics and in linguistic research

unlike mega merger it has a trivial termination and cost analysis yo yo was introduced by nicola santoro it proceedes by consecutive elimination and a graph reduction technique called pruning the algorithm is divided in a pre processing phase followed by a cyclic repetition of a forward phase called yo and a backward one called yo yo yo builds elects a minimum leader under the following premises no further restrictions are necessary the preprocessing phase is started with a broadcast at awake state each node sends its id to all of its neighbors and orients the edge towards the higher degree node note as this is just a logical step the bi directional channel is not lost in the procedure by convergecast the initiator is notified of the preprocessing termination this process creates three categories of nodes the yo phase is initiated by the sources a source sends its id through its incoming edges and waits the intermediate nodes wait to receive the respective ids from each of their incoming edges once all of expected values are collected a minimum computation is performed and the minimum id is forwarded through the outgoing edges sinks are passive in this phase the

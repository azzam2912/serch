it is typically observed in large plant and animal cells here flow means that the cytoplasm is moving inside the cell it is not stationary the flow is driven by forces from the cytoskeleton and it is likely that the function of flow is at least partly to speed up transport of molecules and organelles around the cell cytoplasmic streaming is usually found in unusually large cells greater than approximately 0 1 mm in smaller cells diffusion of molecules will be rapid but diffusion slows rapidly as the size increases and so larger cells may need flow to move nutrients etc inside them rapidly enough for efficient function the green alga genus chara possesses some very large cells up to 10 cm in length and cytoplasmic streaming has been studied in these large cells cytoplasmic streaming is strongly dependent upon intracellular ph and temperature it has been observed that the effect of temperature on cytoplasmic streaming created linear variance and dependence at different high temperatures in comparison to low temperatures this process is complicated with temperature alterations in the system increasing its efficiency with other factors such as the transport of ions across the membrane being simultaneously affected this is

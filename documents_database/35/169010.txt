the cipher s designers were david wheeler and roger needham of the cambridge computer laboratory and the algorithm was presented in an unpublished technical report in 1997 needham and wheeler 1997 it is not subject to any patents like tea xtea is a 64 bit block feistel cipher with a 128 bit key and a suggested 64 rounds several differences from tea are apparent including a somewhat more complex key schedule and a rearrangement of the shifts xors and additions this standard c source code adapted from the reference code released into the public domain by david wheeler and roger needham encrypts and decrypts using xtea the changes from the reference source code are minor the recommended value for the num rounds parameter is 32 not 64 as each iteration of the loop does two feistel cipher rounds to additionally improve speed the loop can be unrolled by pre computing the values of sum key in 2004 ko et al presented a related key differential attack on 27 out of 64 rounds of xtea requiring 2 chosen plaintexts and a time complexity of 2 ko et al 2004 in 2009 lu presented a related key rectangle attack on 36 rounds

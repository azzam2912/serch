the minimal rebound is helpful in avoiding accidental damage to precision work especially in tight locations and in applications such as maintenance work on hydraulic cylinders the head of the dead blow hammer can be solid or hollow often partially filled with loose sand or steel shot which distributes the energy of the strike over a longer period of time and reduces rebound if a filled hammer head breaks while in use it is likely to scatter a spray of the loose filler particles in the vicinity therefore use of a traditional hollow dead blow hammer may be restricted in certain settings such as a manufacturing clean room where contamination by foreign material could occur solid head dead blow hammers are usually made of rubber or resilient plastic such as ultra high molecular weight plastic uhmw and rely on the inherent properties of the material to absorb shock and reduce rebound commonly constructed of polyurethane dead blow hammers regularly appear in solid orange or black composite heads and fiberglass handle models are also available with optional shock absorbent rubber grips a variant design omits the handle entirely the dead blow head is gripped directly in the hand for use in

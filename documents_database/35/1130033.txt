its only known tnfsf ligand is tnf like protein 1a tl1a the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tnf receptor superfamily this receptor is expressed preferentially by activated and antigen experienced t lymphocytes tnfrsf25 is also highly expressed by foxp3 positive regulatory t lymphocytes tnfrsf25 is activated by a monogamous ligand known as tl1a tnfsf15 which is rapidly upregulated in antigen presenting cells and some endothelial cells following toll like receptor or fc receptor activation this receptor has been shown to signal both through the tradd adaptor molecule to stimulate nf kappa b activity or through the fadd adaptor molecule to stimulate caspase activation and regulate cell apoptosis multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported most of which are potentially secreted molecules the alternative splicing of this gene in b and t cells encounters a programmed change upon t cell activation which predominantly produces full length membrane bound isoforms and is thought to be involved in controlling lymphocyte proliferation induced by t cell activation specifically activation of tnfrsf25 is dependent upon previous engagement of the t cell receptor following binding to tl1a tnfrsf25 signaling increases the sensitivity of t

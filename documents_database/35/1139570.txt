the osr1 and osr2 transcription factors participate in the normal development of body parts such as the kidney protein odd skipped related 1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that in humans is encoded by the osr1 gene found on chromosome 2 2p24 1 and in mice is encoded by the osr1 gene in mammals osr1 is involved in the development of the kidneys heart and in the palate and is often coexpressed with osr2 osr1 and osr2 are homologous to the odd skipped class transcription factors in drosophila encoded by odd bowl sob and arm osr1 is a 266 amino acid protein and contains three ch zinc finger domains osr1 and osr2 share 65 amino acid sequence and 98 zinc finger domain similarity in mice during gastrulation on embryological day 7 5 cells fated to become intermediate mesoderm show the mouse osr1 homologue osr1 expression a day later it is expressed in the intermediate mesoderm lateral to the neural plate osr1 expression weakens and shifts posteriorly to the presumptive kidneys by day 9 5 by day 10 5 the branchial arch and limbs also begin to express osr1 osr1 regulates atrial septum formation in the heart osr1 is expressed

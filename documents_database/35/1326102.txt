it was a direct descendant of the roman hypocaust and due to its slow rate of combustion it allowed people to use smaller fuels such as hay instead of wood the gloria consisted of a firebox generally located outside in a courtyard for example which burned hay and one or more ducts that ran under the floors of the rooms to be heated the warm exhaust gases from the combustion would pass through these ducts and then be released outside through a vertical flue the system is more efficient than a fireplace because the rate of combustion and therefore the heat output can be regulated by restricting the airflow into the firebox moreover the air required for combustion does not have to pass through the interior of the building which reduces cold drafts finally because the firebox is not open to the interior there is no risk of filling the interior with smoke despite these benefits it is not advisable to use this system today as modern furnaces are far more efficient the modern equivalent of the gloria would be underfloor heating which uses piped hot water under the floor to heat rooms and like the gloria has the benefit

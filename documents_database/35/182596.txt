it is basically a round shaft pointed on one end with a lateral groove behind it the point eases the insertion of the hook through the material being crocheted and the groove makes it possible to pull a loop back through the material the shaft is then divided into a working area that determines the hook s nominal diameter and ensures the uniform sizing of the loops formed on it and a handle crochet appeared as a distinct textile art during the early 19th century and many crochet hooks survive from that period these can be sorted into two groups the one with thin steel hooks that are set into separate handles and the other including single piece hooks made in a variety of materials the distinction between steel and other hooks persists to the present day although all are now commonly of single piece construction a variety of coverings may be applied to the handle for ergonomic reasons ornate handles have been made for their decorative value throughout crochet hooks are currently produced in diameters ranging from 0 35 mm to 25 mm these diameters are indicated both directly in millimeters and by various numerical or literal gauge systems

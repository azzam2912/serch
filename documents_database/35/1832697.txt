it can induce excitatory non lethal behavioral symptoms like quivering and jerking in crickets covalitoxin ii cvtx ii is a toxin in the venom of coremiocnemis validus singapore or blue femur tarantula this spider lives in south east asian tropical forests the toxin consists of 31 amino acids acsragencyksgrccdglyckayvvtcykp this sequence forms a peptide with a molecular weight of 3 4 kda it has six cysteine residues which form three disulphide bonds between the specific amino acid locations 2 16 19 21 and 15 28 there is an equal distribution of hydrophilic hydrophobic and neutral amino acids near the c terminus there is a positively charged surface formed by conserved basic residues which is thought to interact with an ion channel the inhibitor cystine knot motif that is formed by the cysteine residues shows analogy to other spider toxins and can also be found in conotoxins which are present in the venom of cone snails it has low homology with two peptides the specific target and mechanism of action of cvtx ii are not yet clear based on its effect on behavior it has been speculated that cvtx ii targets sodium channel inactivation analogous to some excitotoxins cvtx ii induces

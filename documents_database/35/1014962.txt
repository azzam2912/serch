it is mainly composed of gypsum caso 2ho although gypsum is a widely used material in the construction industry phosphogypsum is usually not used but is stored indefinitely because of its weak radioactivity the long range storage is controversial phosphogypsum is a side product from the production of phosphoric acid by treating phosphate ore apatite with sulfuric acid according to the following reaction phosphogypsum is radioactive due to the presence of naturally occurring uranium and thorium and their daughter isotopes radium radon polonium etc marine deposited phosphate typically has a higher level of radioactivity than igneous phosphate deposits because uranium is present in seawater phosphogypsum also can contain high levels of cadmium the united states environmental protection agency has banned most applications of phosphogypsum having a ra concentration of greater than 10 picocurie gram 0 4 bq g as a result phosphogypsum which exceeds this limit is stored in large stacks central florida has a large quantity of phosphate deposits particularly in the bone valley region however the marine deposited phosphate ore from central florida is weakly radioactive and as such the phosphogypsum by product in which the radionuclides are somewhat concentrated is too radioactive to be used for most

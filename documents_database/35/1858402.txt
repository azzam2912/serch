networking lists of statements acts to reduce them into a handful of clusters or categories the statements might be source from interviews text web sites focus groups swot analysis or community consultation idea networking is inductive as it does not assume any prior classification system to cluster the statements rather keywords or issues in the statements are individually linked paired these links can then be entered into network software to be displayed as a network with clusters when named these clusters provide emergent categories meta themes frames or concepts which represent structure or sense make the collection of statements an idea network can be constructed in the following way the number of links per statement should be from 1 to 7 many more will result in a congested network diagram this means choosing why the statements are linked may need grading as strong or weak or by sub sets for example statements linked as being about weather conditions may be further subdivided into those about good weather wet weather or bad weather etc this linking is sometimes called coding in thematic analysis which highlights that the statements can be linked for several and different reasons source context time etc there

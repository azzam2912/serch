the marginal distributions of symmetric multivariate laplace distribution variables are laplace distributions the marginal distributions of asymmetric multivariate laplace distribution variables are asymmetric laplace distributions a typical characterization of the symmetric multivariate laplace distribution has the characteristic function where formula 8 is the vector of means for each variable and formula 9 is the covariance matrix unlike the multivariate normal distribution even if the covariance matrix has zero covariance and correlation the variables are not independent the symmetric multivariate laplace distribution is elliptical if formula 10 the probability density function pdf for a k dimensional multivariate laplace distribution becomes where formula 1 and formula 2 is the modified bessel function of the second kind in the correlated bivariate case i e k 2 with formula 14 the pdf reduces to where formula 16 and formula 17 are the standard deviations of formula 18 and formula 19 respectively and formula 20 is the correlation coefficient of formula 18 and formula 19 for the independent bivariate laplace case that is k 2 formula 23 and formula 24 the pdf becomes a typical characterization of the asymmetric multivariate laplace distribution has the characteristic function as with the symmetric multivariate laplace distribution the asymmetric

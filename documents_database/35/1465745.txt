members of this genus have been found living mutualistically on the cuticle of the leafcutter ants because the bacteria has antibiotic properties that protect the fungus grown by the ants when they are grooming their legs are passed over their mouth gland metapleural gland that produces the antibiotic and then their legs touch the fungi while they are walking around the ants have metapleural glands that produce the antimicrobial components to eliminate the escovopsis fungi the bacteria may also be found in crypts on the propleural plate pseudonocardia is found to have antibiotic properties provided to the leaf cutter ant to inhibit the growth of escovopsis which is a black yeast that parasitizes the leaf cutter ant pseudonocardia can be found in both aquatic including marine and terrestrial ecosystems pseudonocardia can be referred to as a actinobacteria most actinobacteria grow in soils that are of a neutral ph actinobacteria are also important in plant associated microbial communities are referred to as free living this means that they are not dependent on another organism to live for example a non free living organism would be a parasite that depends on a host as a food source and a place for shelter

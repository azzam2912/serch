infection of gnathostoma hispidum like many species of gnathostoma causes the disease gnathostomiasis due to the migration of immature worms in the tissues in the natural definitive host pigs cats dogs wild animals the adult worms reside in a tumor which they induce in the gastric wall they deposit eggs that are unembryonated when passed in the feces eggs become embryonated in water and eggs release first stage larvae if ingested by a small crustacean cyclops first intermediate host the first stage larvae develop into second stage larvae following ingestion of the cyclops by a fish frog or snake second intermediate host the second stage larvae migrate into the flesh and develop into third stage larvae when the second intermediate host is ingested by a definitive host the third stage larvae develop into adult parasites in the stomach wall alternatively the second intermediate host may be ingested by the paratenic host animals such as birds snakes and frogs in which the third stage larvae do not develop further but remain infective to the next predator humans become infected by eating undercooked fish or poultry containing third stage larvae or reportedly by drinking water containing infective second stage larvae in cyclops

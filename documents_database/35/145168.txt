the name primorial coined by harvey dubner draws an analogy to primes similar to the way the name factorial relates to factors for the th prime number the primorial is defined as the product of the first primes where is the th prime number for instance signifies the product of the first 5 primes the first five primorials are the sequence also includes as empty product asymptotically primorials grow according to where is little o notation in general for a positive integer a primorial can also be defined namely as the product of those primes where is the prime counting function giving the number of primes this is equivalent to for example 12 represents the product of those primes 12 since this can be calculated as consider the first 12 values of we see that for composite every term simply duplicates the preceding term as given in the definition in the above example we have since 12 is a composite number primorials are related to the first chebyshev function written or according to since asymptotically approaches for large values of primorials therefore grow according to the idea of multiplying all known primes occurs in some proofs of the infinitude of

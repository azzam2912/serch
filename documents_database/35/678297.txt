when safety belt laws are passed belt wearing rates increase but casualties decline by smaller percentages than estimated in a simple calculation this is because those converted from non use to use are not recruited random members of the driving population instead users differ from non users in many ways that influence safety two effects are say initial belt use was zero it never is but this assumption makes it easy to understand and after a belt law is passed use rate increases to 50 as belts reduce driver fatality risk in crashes by 42 a naive calculation would lead one to expect a 21 reduction in fatalities in fact a lesser reduction is observed a somewhat complicated equation p 293 of traffic safety book estimates expected fatality reductions when use rates increase from any initial percent to any new percent for the case of an increase in belt use from zero to 50 the calculated reduction in deaths is 16 well below the 21 estimated from the naive calculation so even when belt wearing rates reach 90 the 10 who do not wear have substantially more crashes and more severe crashes than the overall population the 10 of non

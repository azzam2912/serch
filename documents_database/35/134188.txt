they play an important role in signal transduction pathways where they act as a second messenger in neurotransmitter release from neurons in contraction of all muscle cell types and in fertilization many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor including several of the coagulation factors extracellular calcium is also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes as well as proper bone formation plasma calcium levels in mammals are tightly regulated with bone acting as the major mineral storage site calcium ions ca are released from bone into the bloodstream under controlled conditions calcium is transported through the bloodstream as dissolved ions or bound to proteins such as serum albumin parathyroid hormone secreted by the parathyroid gland regulates the resorption of ca from bone reabsorption in the kidney back into circulation and increases in the activation of vitamin d to calcitriol calcitriol the active form of vitamin d promotes absorption of calcium from the intestines and bones calcitonin secreted from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland also affects calcium levels by opposing parathyroid hormone however its physiological significance in humans is dubious intracellular calcium is stored in organelles which repetitively release and then reaccumulate ca ions in

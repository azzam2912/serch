photosystem ii psii is more sensitive to light than the rest of the photosynthetic machinery and most researchers define the term as light induced damage to psii in living organisms photoinhibited psii centres are continuously repaired via degradation and synthesis of the d1 protein of the photosynthetic reaction center of psii photoinhibition is also used in a wider sense as dynamic photoinhibition to describe all reactions that decrease the efficiency of photosynthesis when plants are exposed to light the first measurements of photoinhibition were published in 1956 by bessel kok even in the very first studies it was obvious that plants have a repair mechanism that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage in 1966 jones and kok measured the action spectrum of photoinhibition and found that ultraviolet light is highly photoinhibitory the visible light part of the action spectrum was found to have a peak in the red light region suggesting that chlorophylls act as photoreceptors of photoinhibition in the 1980s photoinhibition became a popular topic in photosynthesis research and the concept of a damaging reaction counteracted by a repair process was re invented research was stimulated by a paper by kyle ohad and arntzen in 1984 showing that photoinhibition is accompanied

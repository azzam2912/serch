it is unique among the 10 for having 600 vertices and has the same vertex arrangement as the regular convex 120 cell it is one of four regular star polychora discovered by ludwig schl fli it is named by john horton conway extending the naming system by arthur cayley for the kepler poinsot solids and the only one containing all three modifiers in the name with its dual it forms the compound of great grand stellated 120 cell and grand 600 cell the great grand stellated 120 cell is the final stellation of the 120 cell and is the only schl fli hess polychoron to have the 120 cell for its convex hull in this sense it is analogous to the three dimensional great stellated dodecahedron which is the final stellation of the dodecahedron and the only kepler poinsot polyhedron to have the dodecahedron for its convex hull indeed the great grand stellated 120 cell is dual to the grand 600 cell which could be taken as a 4d analogue of the great icosahedron dual of the great stellated dodecahedron the edges of the great grand stellated 120 cell are as long as those of the 120 cell core deep

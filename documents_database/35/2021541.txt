the lambda2 method is galilean invariant which means it produces the same results when a uniform velocity field is added to the existing velocity field or when the field is translated the flow velocity of a fluid is a vector field which is used to mathematically describe the motion of a continuum the length of the flow velocity vector is the flow speed and is a scalar the flow velocity formula 1 of a fluid is a vector field which gives the velocity of an element of fluid at a position formula 3 and time formula 4 the lambda2 method determines for any point formula 1 in the fluid whether this point is part of a vortex core a vortex is now defined as a connected region for which every point inside this region is part of a vortex core usually one will also obtain a large number of small vortices when using the above definition in order to detect only real vortices a threshold can be used to discard any vortices below a certain size e g volume or number of points contained in the vortex the lambda2 method consists of several steps first we define the gradient velocity

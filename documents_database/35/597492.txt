trypsin is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of many different proteins primarily as part of digestion in humans and other animals such as monogastrics and young ruminants when trypsin inhibitor is consumed it acts as an irreversible and competitive substrate it competes with proteins to bind to trypsin and therefore renders it unavailable to bind with proteins for the digestion process as a result protease inhibitors that interfere with digestion activity have an antinutritional effect therefore trypsin inhibitor is considered an anti nutritional factor or anf additionally trypsin inhibitor partially interferes with chymotrypsin function trypsinogen is an inactive form of trypsin its inactive form ensures protein aspects of the body such as the pancreas and muscles are not broken down it is formed in the pancreas and activated to trypsin with enteropeptidase chymotrypsinogen is the inactive form of chymotrypsin and has similar functions as trypsin the presence of trypsin inhibitor has been found to result in delayed growth as well as metabolic and digestive diseases additionally pancreatic hypertrophy is a common occurrence with trypsin inhibitor consumption the presence of trypsin inhibitor in a product reduces the protein efficiency and therefore results in the consumers body not being able to

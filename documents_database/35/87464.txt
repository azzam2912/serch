mammals and birds in contrast have a class of cells called melanocytes for coloration chromatophores are largely responsible for generating skin and eye colour in ectothermic animals and are generated in the neural crest during embryonic development mature chromatophores are grouped into subclasses based on their colour more properly hue under white light xanthophores yellow erythrophores red iridophores reflective iridescent leucophores white melanophores black brown and cyanophores blue some species can rapidly change colour through mechanisms that translocate pigment and reorient reflective plates within chromatophores this process often used as a type of camouflage is called physiological colour change or metachrosis cephalopods such as the octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this whereas vertebrates such as chameleons generate a similar effect by cell signalling such signals can be hormones or neurotransmitters and may be initiated by changes in mood temperature stress or visible changes in the local environment chromatophores are studied by scientists to understand human disease and as a tool in drug discovery aristotle mentioned the ability of the octopus to change colour for both camouflage and signalling in his historia animalium ca 400 bc giosu sangiovanni was the first to describe invertebrate pigment bearing

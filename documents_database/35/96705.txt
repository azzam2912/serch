lapse rate arises from the word lapse in the sense of a gradual change it corresponds to the vertical component of the spatial gradient of temperature although this concept is most often applied to the earth s troposphere it can be extended to any gravitationally supported parcel of gas a formal definition from the glossary of meteorology is typically the lapse rate under consideration is the negative of the rate of temperature change with altitude change thus where formula 2 sometimes formula 3 is the lapse rate given in units of temperature divided by units of altitude t is temperature and z is altitude the temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between radiation and convection sunlight hits the ground and heats it the ground then heats the air at the surface if radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly and the temperature would decay exponentially with height however when air is hot it tends to expand which lowers its density thus hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward this is the process of

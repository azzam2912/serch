generally occurring on high capacity and high speed routes such as freeways they are one of the deadliest forms of traffic collisions the most disastrous pile ups have involved more than a hundred vehicles pile ups generally occur in low visibility conditions as drivers on freeways are sometimes caught out by driving too close to the vehicle in front and not adjusting to the road conditions chain reaction crashes can also occur in conditions of good visibility when black ice or other road hazards are encountered unexpectedly as drivers round a curve or crest a hill another possibility is a third vehicle is simply too close to the initial collision to avoid hitting one or both of the vehicles due to the high traffic speeds on the road if one car develops a problem and suddenly halts those behind it cannot stop in time and may hit it considering that these roads often have high traffic volumes more cars are forced into braking and skidding darting into other lanes and in front of oncoming traffic and so more vehicles become involved creating a chain reaction effect determining the cause of such collisions is difficult for investigators and it is often

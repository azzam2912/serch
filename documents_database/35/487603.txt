icing conditions can be particularly dangerous to aircraft as the built up ice changes the aerodynamics of the flight surfaces which can increase the risk of a stall for this reason on board ice protection systems have been developed and aircraft are often deiced prior to take off in icy environments water does not always freeze at water that persists in liquid state below this temperature is said to be supercooled and supercooled water droplets cause icing on aircraft below icing is rare because clouds at these temperatures usually consist of ice particles rather than supercooled water droplets below supercooled water cannot exist therefore icing is impossible icing also occurs on towers wind turbines boats oil rigs trees and other objects exposed to low temperatures and water droplets in cold climates on land atmospheric icing can be common as elevated terrain interacts with cold clouds ice loads are a major cause of catastrophic failures of overhead electric power lines their estimation is therefore crucial in the structural design of power line systems and can be done by numerical icing models that include meteorological data

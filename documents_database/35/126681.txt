the technique is often used for the analysis of polymers as a technique sec was first developed in 1955 by lathe and ruthven the term gel permeation chromatography can be traced back to j c moore of the dow chemical company who investigated the technique in 1964 and the proprietary column technology was licensed to waters corporation who subsequently commercialized this technology in 1964 gpc systems and consumables are now also available from a number of manufacturers it is often necessary to separate polymers both to analyze them as well as to purify the desired product when characterizing polymers it is important to consider the dispersity as well the molecular weight polymers can be characterized by a variety of definitions for molecular weight including the number average molecular weight m the weight average molecular weight m see molar mass distribution the size average molecular weight m or the viscosity molecular weight m gpc allows for the determination of as well as m and based on other data the m m and m can be determined gpc separates based on the size or hydrodynamic volume radius of gyration of the analytes this differs from other separation techniques which depend upon chemical

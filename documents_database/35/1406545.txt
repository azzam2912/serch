it is a relatively large unicellular protist and is commonly known for its thin reticulopodia radiating outwards from the cell bass et al 2012 reticulamoeba are strictly benthic protists that use their reticulopodia for feeding they have a close association with benthic diatoms as their main source of food bass et al 2012 there are only two reticulamoeba species described to date and the protozoologist karl grell discovered both of them bass et al 2012 the genus reticulamoeba was described in 1994 by the protozoologist karl grell based on the species r gemmipara and not until a year later a second species r minor was discovered bass et al 2012 the two species form a clade within the cercozoan class granofilosea bass et al 2012 within this clade reticulamoeba present phylogenetic similarities with the genus mesofila bass et al 2012 reticulamoeba is commonly isolated from benthic marine littoral zones as well as in freshwater biofilm bass et al 2012 the genus is an amoeboflagellate with a stationary flattened amoeboid stage bass et al 2012 the body of reticulamoeba is roundish with an irregular outline and about 3 8 m across bass et al 2012 the cell consists of a nucleus

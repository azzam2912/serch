this crucial invention gave rise to the caplock or percussion lock system before this development firearms used flintlock ignition systems that produced flint on steel sparks to ignite a pan of priming powder and thereby fire the gun s main powder charge the flintlock mechanism replaced older ignition systems such as the matchlock and wheellock flintlocks were prone to misfire in wet weather and many flintlock firearms were later converted to the more reliable percussion system the percussion cap is a small cylinder of copper or brass with one closed end inside the closed end is a small amount of a shock sensitive explosive material such as fulminate of mercury the percussion cap is placed over a hollow metal nipple at the rear end of the gun barrel pulling the trigger releases a hammer that strikes the percussion cap and ignites the explosive primer the flame travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge percussion caps were and still are made in small sizes for pistols and larger sizes for rifles and muskets while the metal percussion cap was the most popular and widely used type of primer their small size made them difficult to handle under

the systematic name of this enzyme class is dtdp 4 dehydro 6 deoxy d glucose 3 5 epimerase other names in common use include dtdp l rhamnose synthetase dtdp l rhamnose synthetase thymidine diphospho 4 ketorhamnose 3 5 epimerase tdp 4 ketorhamnose 3 5 epimerase dtdp 4 dehydro 6 deoxy d glucose 3 5 epimerase and tdp 4 keto l rhamnose 3 5 epimerase this enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways nucleotide sugars metabolism streptomycin biosynthesis and polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis the crystal structure of rmlc from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was determined in the presence and absence of a substrate analogue rmlc is a homodimer comprising a central jelly roll motif which extends in two directions into longer beta sheets binding of dtdp is stabilised by ionic interactions to the phosphate group and by a combination of ionic and hydrophobic interactions with the base the active site which is located in the centre of the jelly roll is formed by residues that are conserved in all known rmlc sequence homologues the active site is lined with a number of charged residues and a number of residues with hydrogen bonding potentials which together comprise a potential network for substrate binding and catalysis

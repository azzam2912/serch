dall the size of the shell varies between 12 mm and 50 mm the thin trochoid shell is yellowish white with rose colored flammules and nebulosities with more or less articulation on the spiral ridges the glassy nucleus is very minute the nepionic shell i e the whorls immediately following the embryonic whorls are white depressed above of three rather rounded whorls with numerous low radial plications or riblets the subsequent whorls number four with a sparsely imbricate keel at the periphery and a prominent beaded spiral cord one third of the way from the appressed posterior suture toward the periphery this arrangement gives a channeled or turriculate aspect to the shell in the sutural region the body whorl has a third keel imbricate like the peripheral one but less prominent bordering the base the space between the beaded cord and the peripheral keel is on the upper whorls finely spirally striated but on the last whorl first two and then a third small spiral equidistant threads articulated white and dark rose color are developed the imbrications on the two keels are short distant subspinose and channeled in front the base of the shell is nearly smooth with fine spiral

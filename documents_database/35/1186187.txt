an enzyme mimic is a small molecule complex that models the molecular structure spectroscopic properties or reactivity of an enzyme sometimes called bioinspired complexes enzymes are biological catalysts biopolymers that catalyze a reaction although a small number of natural enzymes are built from rna termed ribozymes most enzymes are proteins like any other protein an enzyme is an amino acid polymer with added cofactors and other post translational modifications often most of the amino acid polymer is indirectly involved with the enzymes function perhaps providing ancillary structure or connectivity indirect activity regulation or molecular identification of the enzyme as a result most enzymes are large molecules weighing many kilodaltons this bulk can obscure various investigative techniques such as nmr epr electrochemistry crystallography among others it is standard practice to compare spectroscopic data from enzymes to similar spectroscopic data derived from better characterized small molecules in this way the understanding of metalloenzymes and other metalloproteins have developed in many cases the small molecule analogs were created for other reasons however it has been increasingly common for groups to intentionally make small molecule analogs also known as enzyme mimics these enzyme mimics are prime examples of bioinorganic chemistry most enzyme mimics studies

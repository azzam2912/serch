polyomaviruses in which it occurs include two human polyomaviruses associated with disease bk virus and jc virus as well as the simian polyomavirus sv40 agnoprotein is typically quite short examples from bk virus jc virus and sv40 are 62 71 and 66 amino acid residues long respectively among other known polyomavirus genomes with a predicted agnogene the length of the resulting predicted protein varies considerably from as short as 30 to as long as 154 residues it contains a highly hydrophobic central amino acid sequence a bipartite nuclear localization sequence at the n terminus and highly basic amino acids at both termini comparison of the sequences of different viral agnoproteins suggests sequence conservation toward the n terminus with greater variability toward the c terminus formation of amphipathic alpha helices under laboratory conditions has been demonstrated for part of the sequence believed to have a role in mediating dimerization and oligomerization of the protein the bk jc and sv40 agnoproteins have all been experimentally demonstrated to be phosphorylated in vivo which appears to improve both protein stability and viral propagation but no other post translational modifications have been detected agnoprotein is expressed from a region of the circular viral genome called

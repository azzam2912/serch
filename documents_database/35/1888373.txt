the changes can be of any kind equipment technologies organization doctrine or changes in the environment itself as in any other kind of laboratory the analysis run in the lab is based on experiments since the capabilities to simulate a warfare environment emulate systems or equipment and model actors including their interactions with other actors and their environment are generally necessary to run such experiments modelling and simulation is a major discipline required to operate a battle lab the definition of a battle lab provided by the dnbl operating model document is a combination of test capabilities brought together with operational end users for the purpose of operator training and or development enhancement of operational concepts and procedures presagis defines battle labs as a fairly new concept that allow for the virtual experimentation of new technology and solutions before they are fielded in battle the goal is to test the latest in battlefield organization tactics doctrine and technological capabilities to determine their potential value early on in the acquisition process before significant investment has been made in their preparation and deployment by using simulations or prototypes the battle lab can cost effectively evaluate battlefield performance of new technology or solutions

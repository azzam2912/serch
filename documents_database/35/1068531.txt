despite this the genus does not appear to be adapted for a troglobitic lifestyle and subsequent specimens have been collected from berlesate soil samples run through a berlese funnel troglosironidae are 1 7 to 2 5 mm long and eyeless they have mostly smooth robust chelicerae with or without a dorsal crest on the basal segment they have laterally projecting ozophores tarsal claws on the second pair of legs with a row of teeth no opisthosomal median furrow and a lamelliform adenostyle the coxae 2 are not fused to the coxae 3 but sternites 8 and 9 and tergite 9 are all fused together forming a complete corona analis exocrine gland pores are located on the sternum these gland pores form unique depressions in most species except for those found on the northern half of the island the spermatopositor of the males also exhibit a unique setation pattern as well as enlarged moveable fingers with toothed margins troglosironidae is found exclusively on the island of new caledonia although the possibility exists that they could inhabit nearby islands as well they can be found in leaf litter across the island in both low and high elevations the family is believed to

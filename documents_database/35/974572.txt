three principal techniques were considered following various trials cost effective installation methods were developed for opgw and the starling problem was resolved but the no solution was found at that time for the adss deterioration problem these changes made it possible to install a nationwide network within the budget constraints set for the project and approval was given to start the other technical issues to resolve was what type of optical transmission equipment to use a few years before a new standard for optical transmission systems called synchronous digital hierarchy sdh had been developed and ratified as a global standard as a replacement for existing plesiochronous digital hierarchy pdh equipment as the telecom electric project started manufacturers had started releasing sdh products onto the market and russ taylor the sdh specialist in the te team after researching the uk sdh suppliers recommended the project implement an all sdh network this was a bold step at the time but his research showed that with the right combination of suppliers it was not only feasible but would lead to a more efficient network with lower operating costs than the previous pdh products widely used and much more effective than starting with pdh

most notably long term evolution lte this segmentation exists in two variants fdd and tdd that have been standardized by the 3rd generation partnership project 3gpp and recommended by the international telecommunications union itu as segmentations a5 and a6 respectively the apt band plan has been designed to enable the most efficient use of available spectrum therefore this plan divides the band into contiguous blocks of frequencies that are as large as possible taking account of the need to avoid interference with services in other frequency bands as the result the tdd option segmentation a6 includes 100 mhz of continuous spectrum while the fdd option segmentation a5 comprises two large blocks one of 45 mhz for uplink transmission mobile to network in the lower part of the band and the other also of 45 mhz for downlink transmission in the upper part as defined in the standard both fdd and tdd schemes for the 700 mhz band include guard bands of 5 mhz and 3 mhz at their lower and upper edges respectively the fdd version also includes a center gap of 10 mhz the guardbands serve the purpose of mitigating interference with adjacent bands while the fdd center gap

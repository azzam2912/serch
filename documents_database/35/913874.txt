a contrast medium is injected into a bile duct in the liver after which x rays are taken it allows access to the biliary tree in cases where endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp has been unsuccessful initially reported in 1937 the procedure became popular in 1952 it is predominantly now performed as a therapeutic technique there are less invasive means of imaging the biliary tree including transabdominal ultrasound magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound if the biliary system is obstructed ptc may be used to perform biliary drainage until a more permanent solution for the obstruction is performed e g surgery additionally self expanding metal stents can be placed across malignant biliary strictures to allow palliative drainage percutaneous placement of metal stents can be utilised when therapeutic ercp has been unsuccessful anatomy is altered precluding endoscopic access to the duodenum or where there has been separation of the segmental biliary drainage of the liver allowing more selective placement of metal stents cholangiography during a biliary drainage intervention is called perioperative or primary choloangiography and when performed later in the same drain it is called secondary cholangiography cholestatic jaundice to exclude extra hepatic bile duct obstruction prior to biliary drainage

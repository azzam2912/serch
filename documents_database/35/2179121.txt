the separation it provides between the body and the gut prevents the uncontrolled translocation of luminal contents into the body proper its role in protecting the mucosal tissues and circulatory system from exposure to pro inflammatory molecules such as microorganisms toxins and antigens is vital for the maintenance of health and well being intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction has been implicated in numerous health conditions such as food allergies microbial infections irritable bowel syndrome inflammatory bowel disease celiac disease metabolic syndrome non alcoholic fatty liver disease diabetes and septic shock the intestinal mucosal barrier is a heterogeneous entity composed of physical biochemical and immune elements elaborated by the intestinal mucosa the central component is the intestinal epithelial layer which provides physical separation between the lumen and the body the secretion of various molecules into the lumen reinforces the barrier function on the extra epithelial side while a variety of immune cells provide additional protection below the epithelial layer mucus forms a layer or layers in the case of the colon that separates the bulk of the luminal contents from the intestinal epithelium the mucus consists of a highly glycosylated hydrated gel formed by mucin molecules that are secreted by goblet cells

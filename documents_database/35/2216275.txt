biosphere hydrosphere cryosphere atmosphere through naturally occurring processes decade is an initiative within the deep carbon observatory dco volcanoes are the main pathway in which deeply sourced volatiles including carbon are transferred from the earth s interior to the surface environment an additional though less well understood pathway includes along faults and fractures within the earth s crust often referred to as tectonic degassing when the dco was first formed in 2009 estimates of global carbon flux from volcanic regions ranged from 65 to 540 mt yr and constraints on global tectonic degassing were virtually unknown the order of magnitude uncertainty in current volcanic tectonic carbon outgassing makes answering fundamental questions about the global carbon budget virtually impossible in particular one fundamental unknown is if carbon transferred to the earth s interior via subduction is efficiently recycled back to the earth s mantle lithosphere crust and surface environment through volcanic and tectonic degassing or if significant quantities of carbon are being subducted into the deep mantle because significant quantities of mantle carbon are also released through mid ocean ridge volcanism if carbon inputs and outputs at subduction zone settings are in balance then the net effect will be an imbalance

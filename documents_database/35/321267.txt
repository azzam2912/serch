kraft s version or a uniquely decodable code in brockway mcmillan s version for a given set of codeword lengths its applications to prefix codes and trees often find use in computer science and information theory kraft s inequality was published in however kraft s paper discusses only prefix codes and attributes the analysis leading to the inequality to raymond redheffer the result was independently discovered in mcmillan proves the result for the general case of uniquely decodable codes and attributes the version for prefix codes to a spoken observation in 1955 by joseph leo doob kraft s inequality limits the lengths of codewords in a prefix code if one takes an exponential of the length of each valid codeword the resulting set of values must look like a probability mass function that is it must have total measure less than or equal to one kraft s inequality can be thought of in terms of a constrained budget to be spent on codewords with shorter codewords being more expensive among the useful properties following from the inequality are the following statements let each source symbol from the alphabet be encoded into a uniquely decodable code over an alphabet of size

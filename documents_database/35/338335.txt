silibinin itself is a mixture of two diastereomers silybin a and silybin b in approximately equimolar ratio the mixture exhibits a number of pharmacological effects particularly in the liver and there is some clinical evidence for the use of silibinin as a supportive element in alcoholic and child grade a liver cirrhosis poor water solubility and bioavailability of silymarin led to the development of enhanced formulations silipide trade name siliphos not to be confused with water treatment compound of same name a glass like polyphosphate containing sodium calcium magnesium and silicate formulated for the treatment of water problems a complex of silymarin and phosphatidylcholine lecithin is about 10 times more bioavailable than silymarin an earlier study had concluded siliphos to have 4 6 fold higher bioavailability it has been also reported that silymarin inclusion complex with cyclodextrin is much more soluble than silymarin itself there have also been prepared glycosides of silybin which show better water solubility and even stronger hepatoprotective effect silymarin like other flavonoids has been shown to inhibit p glycoprotein mediated cellular efflux the modulation of p glycoprotein activity may result in altered absorption and bioavailability of drugs that are p glycoprotein substrates it has been reported

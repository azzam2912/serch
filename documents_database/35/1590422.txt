initially they took the form of custom integrated systems designed and delivered by system integrators these solutions were largely based on separate commercial off the shelf cots products that a system integrator acquired and integrated into the custom solution these solutions have evolved into vendor supplied product solutions that no longer require the integration of separate components eatm products as they are known today are available as cots appliance products fully configurable and not needing any software development or custom integration hardware platform embedded computer computer appliance device communications software support for the device protocols from which data will be extracted device communications software typically operates through polled or change based protocols that are vendor specific data to be extracted is typically organized into related items and transferred based on a machine status such as cycle complete job start system downtime event operator change etc typical protocols rockwell automation cip controllogix backplane ethernet ip siemens industrial ethernet modbus tcp there are hundreds of automation device protocols and eatm solutions are typically targeting certain market segments and will be based on automation vendor relationships enterprise communications software software that will enable communications to enterprise systems communications at this level are typically

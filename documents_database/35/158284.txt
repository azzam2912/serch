a pancake number is the minimum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes in this form the problem was first discussed by american geometer jacob e goodman it is a variation of the sorting problem in which the only allowed operation is to reverse the elements of some prefix of the sequence unlike a traditional sorting algorithm which attempts to sort with the fewest comparisons possible the goal is to sort the sequence in as few reversals as possible a variant of the problem is concerned with burnt pancakes where each pancake has a burnt side and all pancakes must in addition end up with the burnt side on bottom the minimum number of flips required to sort any stack of pancakes has been shown to lie between and approximately 1 07 n and 1 64 n but the exact value is not known the most simple pancake sorting algorithm must have at most flips in this algorithm a number of selection sort we bring the largest pancake not yet sorted to the top with one flip take it down to its final position with one more flip and repeat this process for the remaining pancakes in

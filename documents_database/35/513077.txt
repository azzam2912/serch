this type of acid is a common re usable acid catalyst in chemical reactions to qualify as a heteropoly acid the compound must contain the metal addenda atoms linked by oxygen atoms form a cluster with the hetero atom inside bonded via oxygen atoms examples with more than one type of metal addenda atom in the cluster are well known the conjugate anion of a heteropoly acid is known as a polyoxometalate due to the possibilities of there being different combinations of addenda atoms and different types of hetero atoms there are a lot of heteropolyacids two of the better known groups of these are based on the keggin hxmo and dawson hxmo structures some examples are the heteropolyacids are widely used as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts particularly those based on the keggin structure as they can possess qualities such as good thermal stability high acidity and high oxidising ability some examples of catalysis are heteropolyacids have long been used in analysis and histology and are a component of many reagents e g the folin ciocalteu reagent folins phenol reagent used in the lowry protein assay and epta ethanolic phosphotungstic acid

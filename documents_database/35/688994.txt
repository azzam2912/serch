only m acetivorans and microbes in the genus methanosarcina use all three known metabolic pathways for methanogenesis methanosarcinides including m acetivorans are also the only archaea capable of forming multicellular colonies and even show cellular differentiation the genome of m acetivorans is one of the largest archaeal genomes ever sequenced furthermore one strain of m acetivorans m a c2a has been identified to possess an f type atpase unusual for archaea but common for bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts along with an a type atpase m acetivorans has been noted for its ability to metabolize carbon monoxide to form acetate and formate it can also oxidize carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide the carbon dioxide can then be converted into methane in a process which m acetivorans uses to conserve energy it has been suggested that this pathway may be similar to metabolic pathways used by primitive cells however in the presence of minerals containing iron sulfides as might have been found in sediments in a primordial environment acetate would be catalytically converted into acetate thioester a sulfur containing derivative primitive microbes could obtain biochemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate atp by converting acetate thioester back into acetate using pts

in general relativity a model of an isolated star or other fluid ball generally consists of a fluid filled interior region which is technically a perfect fluid solution of the einstein field equation and an exterior region which is an asymptotically flat vacuum solution these two pieces must be carefully matched across the world sheet of a spherical surface the surface of zero pressure there are various mathematical criteria called matching conditions for checking that the required matching has been successfully achieved similar statements hold for other metric theories of gravitation such as the brans dicke theory in this article we will focus on the construction of exact ssspf solutions in our current gold standard theory of gravitation the theory of general relativity to anticipate the figure at right depicts by means of an embedding diagram the spatial geometry of a simple example of a stellar model in general relativity the euclidean space in which this two dimensional riemannian manifold standing in for a three dimensional riemannian manifold is embedded has no physical significance it is merely a visual aid to help convey a quick impression of the kind of geometrical features we will encounter we list here a few

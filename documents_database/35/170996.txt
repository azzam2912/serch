compared to store and forward this technique reduces latency through the switch and relies on the destination devices for error handling pure cut through switching is only possible when the speed of the outgoing interface is equal to or greater than the incoming interface speed adaptive switching dynamically selects between cut through and store and forward behaviors based on current network conditions cut through switching is closely associated with wormhole switching when cut through switching is used in ethernet because the frame check sequence appears at the end of the frame the switch is not able to verify the integrity of an incoming packet before forwarding it a cut through switch will forward corrupted packets whereas a store and forward switch will drop them the technology was developed by kalpana the company that introduced the first ethernet switch the primary advantage of cut through ethernet switches compared to store and forward ethernet switches is lower latency cut through ethernet switches can support an end to end network delay latency of about 10 microseconds end to end application latencies below 3 microseconds require specialized hardware such as infiniband fragment free is a variation on cut through switching that partially addresses this

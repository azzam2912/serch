the hydraulophone was described and named by steve mann in 2005 and patented in 2011 typically sound is produced by the same hydraulic fluid in contact with the player s fingers it has been used as a sensory exploration device for low vision individuals the term may be applied based on the interface used to play the instrument in which a player blocks the flow of water through a particular hole in order to sound a particular note or based on a hydraulic sound production mechanism hydraulophones use water flow sound producing mechanisms they have a user interface which is blocking water jets to produce sound those described in mann s paper hydraulophone design considerations use water jets striking perforated spinning disks shafts or valves to create a pulsating water flow similar to a siren disk a single disk shaft or valve assembly can have rings or passages with different numbers of holes for different notes some hydraulophones have reeds one or more reed for each finger hole and some are reedless having one or more fipple mechanism associated with each finger hole thus having no moving parts to wear out blocking flow through a finger hole directs the water

it consists of a simple differential equation that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population the model presents a rationale of how current adopters and potential adopters of a new product interact the basic premise of the model is that adopters can be classified as innovators or as imitators and the speed and timing of adoption depends on their degree of innovativeness and the degree of imitation among adopters the bass model has been widely used in forecasting especially new products sales forecasting and technology forecasting mathematically the basic bass diffusion is a riccati equation with constant coefficients in 1969 frank bass published his paper on a new product growth model for consumer durables prior to this everett rogers published diffusion of innovations a highly influential work that described the different stages of product adoption bass contributed some mathematical ideas to the concept where sales formula 6 is the rate of change of installed base i e adoption formula 2 multiplied by the ultimate market potential formula 8 the time of peak sales formula 11 the coefficient p is called the coefficient of innovation external influence or advertising effect the coefficient q is called the

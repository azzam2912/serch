centered on the member star delta lyrae for which it is named it was first suspected in 1959 by american astronomer charles b stephenson then was later concluded not to exist by german astronomer werner bronkalla in 1963 however subsequent photometric observations at the palomar and mount wilson observatories led american astronomer olin j eggen to demonstrate that there was an actual cluster at least for the observed stars down to absolute magnitude 5 5 eggen s study found at least 33 members the cluster has a visual magnitude of 3 8 and spans an angular diameter of 20 arc minutes the tidal radius of the cluster is and it has an estimated combined mass of 589 times the mass of the sun based upon its estimated age and motion through space it may be associated with the gould belt it includes an algol variable star bd 36 3317 discovered in 2007 from spain this is a spectroscopic binary star system that undergoes regular eclipses because the orbital plane is nearly aligned with the line of sight to the earth

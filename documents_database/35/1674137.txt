the rostral ventromedial medulla sends descending inhibitory and excitatory fibers to the dorsal horn spinal cord neurons there are 3 categories of neurons in the rvm on cells off cells and neutral cells they are characterized by their response to nociceptive input off cells show a transitory decrease in firing rate right before a nociceptive reflex and are theorized to be inhibitory activation of off cells either by morphine or by any other means results in antinociception on cells show a burst of activity immediately preceding nociceptive input and are theorized to be contributing to the excitatory drive neutral cells show no response to nociceptive input research has shown the rvm to be important in the maintenance of neuropathic pain ablation of opioid expressing neurons in the rvm with a dermorphin saporin conjugate eliminated the allodynia and hyperalgesia caused by a nerve injury treatment with the dermorphin saporin conjugate did not alter baseline pain thresholds or affect sensitivity in the first 5 10 days after nerve injury this suggests that the rvm contributes to the persistent pathology caused by nerve injury further research determined that a large majority of opioid expressing neurons also expressed cck receptors microinjection in the rvm

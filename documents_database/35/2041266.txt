the disease is caused by the bacterial species xanthomonas translucens pv undulosa the pathogen is found globally but is a primary problem in the us in the lower mid south and can reduce yields by up to 40 percent bls is primarily seed borne the disease is transmitted by seed and survives in and on the seed but may also survive in crop residue in the soil in the off season during the growing season the bacteria may transfer from plant to plant by contact but it is primarily spread by rain wind and insect contact the bacteria thrives in moist environments and produces a cream to yellow bacterial ooze which when dry appears light colored and scale like resulting in a streak on the leaves the invasion of the head of wheat causes bands of necrotic tissue on the awns which is called black chaff the disease is not easily managed as there are no pesticides on the market for treatment of the infection there are some resistant cultivars available but no seed treatment exists some integrated pest management ipm techniques may be used to assist with preventing infection although none will completely prevent the disease bacterial leaf streak

it serves to attach the plantaris gastrocnemius calf and soleus muscles to the calcaneus heel bone these muscles acting via the tendon cause plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle and except the soleus flexion at the knee abnormalities of the achilles tendon include inflammation achilles tendinitis degeneration rupture and becoming embedded with cholesterol deposits xanthomas the achilles tendon connects muscle to bone like other tendons and is located at the back of the lower leg the achilles tendon connects the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to the calcaneal tuberosity on the calcaneus heel bone the tendon begins near the middle of the calf and receives muscle fibers on its inner surface particularly from the soleus muscle almost to its lower end gradually thinning below it inserts into the middle part of the back of the calcaneus bone the tendon spreads out somewhat at its lower end so that its narrowest part is about above its insertion the tendon is covered by the fascia and skin and stands out prominently behind the bone the gap is filled up with areolar and adipose tissue a bursa lies between the tendon and the upper part of the calcaneus it is about long

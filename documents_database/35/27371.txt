irda provides specifications for a complete set of protocols for wireless infrared communications and the name irda also refers to that set of protocols the main reason for using the irda protocols had been wireless data transfer over the last one meter using point and shoot principles thus it has been implemented in portable devices such as mobile telephones laptops cameras printers and medical devices main characteristics of this kind of wireless optical communication is physically secure data transfer line of sight los and very low bit error rate ber that makes it very efficient the mandatory irphy infrared physical layer specification is the physical layer of the irda specifications it comprises optical link definitions modulation coding cyclic redundancy check crc and the framer different data rates use different modulation coding schemes further characteristics are the frame size depends on the data rate mostly and varies between 64 b and 64 kb additionally bigger blocks of data can be transferred by sending multiple frames consecutively this can be adjusted with a parameter called window size 1 127 finally data blocks up to 8 mb can be sent at once combined with a low bit error rate of generally irradiance such

and distinguished professor emeritus of biochemistry at the university of california merced he is a specialist in free radical biology and chemistry antioxidant defense and pioneered work in redox signaling including the mechanisms of induced resistance to oxidative stress he received his degrees from queens college of the city university of new york and columbia university after holding a post doctoral position at duke university he hed faculty positions in biochemistry physiology molecular pharmacology toxicology pediatrics and pathology he was previously a faculty member at the university of pennsylvania the usc school of medicine and the usc school of pharmacy and then moved to the university of alabama birmingham school of public health where he was the chairman of environmental health sciences he was one of the founding faculty at the university of california merced forman has focused almost his entire career on redox free radical biology and chemistry he has worked on the biological generation and defense against oxidants and on the cellular use of oxidants as physiologically important signals his work contains over 200 publications his major current research focuses on understanding how aging causes increased susceptibility to air pollution and how oxidative stress contributes to the pathology

all other information for which hair is a metaphor about the matter which formed a black hole or is falling into it disappears behind the black hole event horizon and is therefore permanently inaccessible to external observers physicist john archibald wheeler expressed this idea with the phrase black holes have no hair which was the origin of the name in a later interview wheeler said that jacob bekenstein coined this phrase the first version of the no hair theorem for the simplified case of the uniqueness of the schwarzschild metric was shown by werner israel in 1967 the result was quickly generalized to the cases of charged or spinning black holes there is still no rigorous mathematical proof of a general no hair theorem and mathematicians refer to it as the no hair conjecture even in the case of gravity alone i e zero electric fields the conjecture has only been partially resolved by results of stephen hawking brandon carter and david c robinson under the additional hypothesis of non degenerate event horizons and the technical restrictive and difficult to justify assumption of real analyticity of the space time continuum suppose two black holes have the same masses electrical charges

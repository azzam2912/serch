some related theories also argue and can show statistically that mass behaviour by becoming more predictable and known to other people can reduce accident risks such as in traffic safety in this case the safety effect creates an actual reduction of danger rather than just a redistribution over a larger group the mathematical biologist w d hamilton proposed his selfish herd theory in 1971 to explain why animals seek central positions in a group each individual can reduce its own domain of danger by situating itself with neighbours all around so it moves towards the centre of the group the effect was tested in brown fur seal predation by great white sharks using decoy seals the distance between decoys was varied to produce different domains of danger the seals with a greater domain of danger had as predicted an increased risk of shark attack antipredator adaptations such as the flocking of birds herding of sheep and schooling of fish similarly adelie penguins wait to jump into the water until a large enough group has assembled reducing each individual s risk of seal predation in 1949 r j smeed reported that per capita road fatality rates tended to be lower in

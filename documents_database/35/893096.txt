a graph is said to be tough for a given real number if for every integer cannot be split into different connected components by the removal of fewer than vertices for instance a graph is tough if the number of components formed by removing a set of vertices is always at most as large as the number of removed vertices the toughness of a graph is the maximum for which it is tough this is a finite number for all finite graphs except the complete graphs which by convention have infinite toughness graph toughness was first introduced by since then there has been extensive work by other mathematicians on toughness the recent survey by lists 99 theorems and 162 papers on the subject removing vertices from a path graph can split the remaining graph into as many as connected components the maximum ratio of components to removed vertices is achieved by removing one vertex from the interior of the path and splitting it into two components therefore paths are tough in contrast removing vertices from a cycle graph leaves at most remaining connected components and sometimes leaves exactly connected components so a cycle is tough if a graph is tough

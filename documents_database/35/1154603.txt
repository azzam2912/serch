it concerns itself only with novel adaptations and events that had a major ecological significance not those that are of solely anthropological interest the timeline displays a graphical representation of the adaptations the text attempts to explain the nature and robustness of the evidence plant evolution is an aspect of the study of biological evolution predominantly involving evolution of plants suited to live on land greening of various land masses by the filling of their niches with land plants and diversification of groups of land plants in the strictest sense the name plant refers to those land plants that form the clade embryophyta comprising the bryophytes and vascular plants however the clade viridiplantae or green plants includes some other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes including green algae it is widely believed that land plants evolved from a group of charophytes most likely simple single celled terrestrial algae similar to extant klebsormidiophyceae chloroplasts in plants evolved from an endosymbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium a photosynthesising prokaryote and a non photosynthetic eukaryotic organism producing a lineage of photosynthesizing eukaryotic organisms in marine and freshwater environments these earliest photosynthesizing single celled autotrophs evolved into multicellular organisms such as the charophyta a group of freshwater

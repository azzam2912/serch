the two types of peep are extrinsic peep peep applied by a ventilator and intrinsic peep peep caused by an incomplete exhalation pressure that is applied or increased during an inspiration is termed pressure support auto intrinsic peep incomplete expiration prior to the initiation of the next breath causes progressive air trapping hyperinflation this accumulation of air increases alveolar pressure at the end of expiration which is referred to as auto peep auto peep develops commonly in high minute ventilation hyperventilation expiratory flow limitation obstructed airway and expiratory resistance narrow airway once auto peep is identified steps should be taken to stop or reduce the pressure build up when auto peep persists despite management of its underlying cause applied peep may be helpful if the patient has an expiratory flow limitation obstruction applied extrinsic peep is usually one of the first ventilator settings chosen when mechanical ventilation is initiated it is set directly on the ventilator a small amount of applied peep 4 to 5 cmho is used in most mechanically ventilated patients to mitigate end expiratory alveolar collapse a higher level of applied peep 5 cmho is sometimes used to improve hypoxemia or reduce ventilator associated lung injury in

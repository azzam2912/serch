this is distinguished from erosion of the bed of the watercourse which is referred to as scour the roots of trees growing by a stream are undercut by such erosion as the roots bind the soil tightly they form abutments which jut out over the water these have a significant effect upon the rate and progress of the erosion there are a variety of methods for measuring river bank erosion rates a direct method is to insert metal rods called erosion pins into the bank and marking the position of the bank surface along the rods at different times this simple measurement technique can be enhanced with the use of a data logger attached to a rod of photoreceptors the logger records the voltage which is an indication of how much of the rod is exposed another common method is to survey a stream cross section repeatedly over time this measures the erosion rate in addition to changes in the geometry of stream banks aerial and satellite imagery can be used to measure rates of bank erosion and river channel migration at larger spatial scales by comparing bank locations at various times finally there are a variety of less common

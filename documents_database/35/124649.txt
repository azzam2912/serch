the process is highly sensitive to temperature variations a heated water bath is mandatory to stabilize the temperature at 100 0 f 37 8 c for the first developer and first wash to maintain process tolerances the e 6 process superseded kodak s e 3 and e 4 processes the e 3 process required fogging with light to accomplish image reversal and produced transparencies that faded quickly the e 4 process used polluting chemicals such as a highly toxic reversal agent tertiary butyl amine borane tbab there are two versions of the e 6 process commercial laboratories use a six bath chemical process the hobby type chemistry kits such as those produced by tetenal use three chemical baths that combine the color developer and fogging bath solutions and the pre bleach bleach and fixer bath solutions the three bath process has a discrete color developer step in between the steps for developing color transparency films using process e6 are

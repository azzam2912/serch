laser surface velocimeters use the laser doppler principle to evaluate the laser light scattered back from a moving object they are widely used for process and quality control in industrial production processes the doppler effect or doppler shift is the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave the wave has a frequency f and propagates at a speed c when the observer moves at a velocity of v relative to the source he receives a different frequency f according to the above analysis is an approximation for small velocities in comparison to the speed of light which is fulfilled very well for practically all technically relevant velocities to make a measurement on moving objects which can in principle be of any length requires a measurement design with an observation axis for the sensor which is at a right angle to the direction of movement of the object under investigation laser surface velocimeters work according to the so called difference doppler technique here 2 laser beams which are each incident to the optical axis at an angle are superimposed on the surface of the object for a point p which moves

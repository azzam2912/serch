the number of thermal features in yellowstone is estimated at 10 000 a study that was completed in 2011 found that a total of 1 283 geysers have erupted in yellowstone 465 of which are active during an average year these are distributed among nine geyser basins with a few geysers found in smaller thermal areas throughout the park the number of geysers in each geyser basin are as follows upper geyser basin 410 midway geyser basin 59 lower geyser basin 283 norris geyser basin 193 west thumb geyser basin 84 gibbon geyser basin 24 lone star geyser basin 21 shoshone geyser basin 107 heart lake geyser basin 69 other areas 33 although famous large geysers like old faithful are part of the total most of yellowstone s geysers are small erupting to only a foot or two the hydrothermal system that supplies the geysers with hot water sits within an ancient active caldera many of the thermal features in yellowstone build up sinter geyserite or travertine deposits around and within them the various geyser basins are located where rainwater and snowmelt can percolate into the ground get indirectly superheated by the underlying yellowstone hotspot and then erupt at the

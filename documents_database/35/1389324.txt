these representations include closely packed spheres cpk models made of plastic metal wires for skeletal models graphic computations and animations by computers artistic rendering computer molecular models also allow animations and molecular dynamics simulations that are very important for understanding how dna functions in vivo the more advanced computer based molecular models of dna involve molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics computations of vibro rotations delocalized molecular orbitals mos electric dipole moments hydrogen bonding and so on dna molecular dynamics modeling involves simulating deoxyribonucleic acid dna molecular geometry and topology changes with time as a result of both intra and inter molecular interactions of dna whereas molecular models of dna molecules such as closely packed spheres cpk models made of plastic or metal wires for skeletal models are useful representations of static dna structures their usefulness is very limited for representing complex dna dynamics computer molecular modeling allows both animations and molecular dynamics simulations that are very important to understand how dna functions in vivo from the very early stages of structural studies of dna by x ray diffraction and biochemical means molecular models such as the watson crick nucleic acid double helix model were successfully employed to solve the

the object based spatial model treats the world as surface littered with recognizable objects e g cities rivers which exist independent of their locations objects can be simple as polygons and lines or be more complex to represent cities while a field based data model sees the world as a continuous surface over which features e g elevation vary using an object based spatial database it is easier to store additional attributes with the objects such as direction speed etc using these attributes can make it easier to answer queries like find all tanks whose speed is 10 km and oriented to north or find all enemy tanks in a certain region storing attributes with objects can provide better result presentation and improved manipulation capabilities in a more efficient way in a field based data model this information is usually stored at different layers and it is harder to extract different information from various layers this data model can be applied above the er as in germ model and giser s shekhar introduces direction as a spatial object and presents a solution to object direction based queries the most common representations for the data model follow an open source software

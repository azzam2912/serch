its molecular structure consists of a cyclohexadiene ring with four hydroxyl groups and two ketone groups in opposite para positions the compound gives a light red solution in water and crystallizes as the glistening bluish black but non conducting dihydrate the compound can be synthesized from glyoxal or from myo inositol phytic acid a natural compound widely present in plants thbq forms an adduct with 4 4 bipyridine in a 2 3 ratio like most phenols thbq is acidic and easily loses the four hydrogen ions from the hydroxyl groups yielding anions such as and the latter is symmetric and aromatic as the double bonds and negative charges are evenly distributed over the six co groups the calcium salt is the dark purple pigment produced from inositol by chromohalobacter beijerinckii in the fermentation of salt beans already noted by t hof in 1935 the dark purple and insoluble dipotassium salt was prepared by preisler and berger in 1942 by oxidizing inositol with nitric acid and reacting the result with potassium carbonate in the presence of oxygen reaction of this salt with hydrochloric acid affords thbq in good yield the black tetrapotassium salt was prepared by west and niu in 1962

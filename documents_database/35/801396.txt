it is a form of beam engine that uses steam at a higher pressure than the earlier engines designed by james watt the engines were also used for powering man engines to assist the underground miners journeys to and from their working levels for winching materials into and out of the mine and for powering on site ore stamping machinery cornwall has long had tin copper and other metal ore mines but if mining is to take place at greater depths a means of draining water from the mine must be found this may be done using horse power or a waterwheel to operate pumps but horses have limited power and waterwheels need a suitable stream of water accordingly the conversion of coal into power to work pumps was highly desirable to the mining industry wheal vor mine had one of the earliest newcomen engines in cylinder condensing engines utilising sub atmospheric pressure before 1714 but cornwall has no coalfield and coal imported from south wales was expensive the cost of fuel for pumping was thus a significant part of mining costs later many of the more efficient early watt engines using an external condenser were erected by boulton and

classically this system is defined for the euclidean plane but one can also consider the system in the hyperbolic plane or in other spaces that suitably generalize the plane outer billiards differs from a usual dynamical billiard in that it deals with a discrete sequence of moves outside the shape rather than inside of it let p be a convex shape in the plane given a point x0 outside p there is typically a unique point x1 also outside p so that the line segment connecting x0 to x1 is tangent to p at its midpoint and a person walking from x0 to x1 would see p on the right see figure the map f x0 x1 is called the outer billiards map the inverse or backwards outer billiards map is also defined as the map x1 x0 one gets the inverse map simply by replacing the word right by the word left in the definition given above the figure shows the situation in the euclidean plane but the definition in the hyperbolic plane is essentially the same an outer billiards orbit is the set of all iterations of the point namely x0 x1 x2 x3 that is start at

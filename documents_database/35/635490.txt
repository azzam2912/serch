it is calculated from the ratio of the beam parameter product bpp of the beam to that of a gaussian beam with the same wavelength it relates the beam divergence of a laser beam to the minimum focussed spot size that can be achieved for a single mode tem gaussian laser beam m is exactly one the m value for a laser beam is widely used in the laser industry as a specification and its method of measurement is regulated as an iso standard m is useful because it reflects how well a collimated laser beam can be focused to a small spot or how well a divergent laser source can be collimated it is a better guide to beam quality than gaussian appearance because there are many cases in which a beam can look gaussian yet have an m value far from unity likewise a beam intensity profile can appear very un gaussian yet have an m value close to unity the value of m is determined by measuring d4 or second moment width unlike the beam parameter product m is unitless and does not vary with wavelength real laser beams are often non gaussian being multi mode or

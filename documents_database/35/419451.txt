previously called dipetalonema viteae it is a rodent filarial worm that is often used as a model to study human filarial infections filarial nematodes are the causative agents of filariases tropical diseases that afflict about 160 million people worldwide currently neither safe and efficient drugs nor vaccines are available to eliminate or prevent these infections which makes the development of new control strategies a priority a viteae is an animal parasite these filarial nematodes and their animal hosts are often used as models for studies on the biology of human infection it shares considerable antigenic homology with the human filarial worm onchocerca volvulus this allows for rapid analysis of larval development which is essential to efforts in vaccine development a viteae is one of the few filaroids that do not bear wolbachia bacteria infection with wolbachia is essential to the continued good health and reproduction of their nematode hosts molecular studies suggest that a viteae either lost its symbionts before they became essential or diverged from other filaroids before wolbachia acquisition more recent research found wolbachia like sequences in the genomes of a viteae some of which were transcribed in developing embryos and testes of the nematode which suggested horizontal

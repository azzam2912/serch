this demonstration requires new mathematics in a sense analogous to newton developing calculus in order to understand planetary motion and classical gravity weak strong and electromagnetic forces of nature are believed to have their natural description in terms of quantum fields attempts to put quantum field theory on a basis of completely defined concepts have involved most branches of mathematics including functional analysis differential equations probability theory representation theory geometry and topology it is known that a quantum field is inherently hard to handle using conventional mathematical techniques like explicit estimates this is because a quantum field has the general nature of an operator valued distribution a type of object from mathematical analysis the existence theorems for quantum fields can be expected to be very difficult to find if indeed they are possible at all one discovery of the theory that can be related in non technical terms is that the dimension d of the spacetime involved is crucial in spite of these impediments tremendous progress occurred spurred on by a long collaboration and extensive work of james glimm and arthur jaffe who showed that with d mathematical foundation and exact interpretation to what previously was only a set of

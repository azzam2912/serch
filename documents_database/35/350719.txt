it is similar to a dinoflagellate it is known as a prevalent pathogen of oysters causing massive mortality in oyster populations the disease it causes is known as dermo or perkinsosis and is characterized by the degradation of oyster tissues the genome of this species has been sequenced the species originally was named dermocystidium marinum p marinus is a protozoan of the protist superphylum alveolata the alveolates its phylum perkinsozoa is a relatively new taxon positioned between the dinoflagellates and the apicomplexa and is probably more closely related to the former p marinus is the type species of the genus perkinsus which was erected in 1978 when first identified in 1950 it was mistaken for a fungus the protist is about 2 to 4 m long the zoospore has two flagella which it uses to swim in its marine habitat it is ingested by its mollusc host which is often an oyster of the genus crassostrea it then becomes a trophozoite which proliferates in the tissues of the host p marinus often infests the hemocytes cells in the blood of the host analogous to malaria in vertebrates it is also often seen in the cells of the intestine connective tissues

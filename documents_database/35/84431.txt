an administrator on the renesas user community boards commented in 2011 that there are no plans for further development of h8 based products the family of largely cisc machines is unrelated to the higher performance superh family of 32 bit risc like microcontrollers it is supported in the linux kernel since version 4 2 subfamilies include the 8 16 bit h8 300 and h8 500 the 16 32 bit h8 300h and h8s and the 32 bit h8sx series each with dozens of different variants varying by speed selection of built in peripherals such as timers and serial ports and amounts of rom flash memory and ram built in rom and flash memory tends to range from 16 kb to 1024 kb and ram from 512 b to 512 kb the basic architecture of the h8 is patterned after the dec pdp 11 architecture with eight 16 bit registers the h8 300h and h8s have an additional bank of eight 16 bit registers and a variety of addressing modes unlike the pdp 11 however the h8 architecture employs big endian byte ordering both h8 300h and h8s have eight 32 bit registers each of which can be treated as one

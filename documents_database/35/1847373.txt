it is a yellow benzene soluble solid which is used industrially for hydroformylation rhh co pph was first prepared by the reduction of rhcl co pph e g with sodium tetrahydroborate or triethylamine and hydrogen in ethanol in the presence of excess triphenylphosphine it can also be prepared from an aldehyde rhodium trichloride and triphenylphosphine in basic alcoholic media the complex adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with trans co and hydrido ligands resulting in pseudo c symmetry the rh p rh c and rh h distances are 2 32 1 83 and 1 60 respectively this complex is one of a small number of stable pentacoordinate rhodium hydrides this precatalyst was uncovered in attempts to use tris triphenylphosphine rhodium chloride as a hydroformylation catalyst it was found that the complex would quickly carbonylate and that the catalytic activity of the resulting material was enhanced by a variety of additives but inhibited by halides this inhibition did not occur in the presence of base suggesting that the hydrido complex represented the catalytic form of the complex rhh co pph is a catalyst for the selective hydroformylation of 1 olefins to produce aldehydes at low pressures and mild temperatures the selectivity for

there are two common yet very different versions of the dot chart the first has been used in hand drawn pre computer era graphs to depict distributions going back to 1884 the other version is described by william s cleveland as an alternative to the bar chart in which dots are used to depict the quantitative values e g counts associated with categorical variables the dot plot as a representation of a distribution consists of group of data points plotted on a simple scale dot plots are used for continuous quantitative univariate data data points may be labelled if there are few of them dot plots are one of the simplest statistical plots and are suitable for small to moderate sized data sets they are useful for highlighting clusters and gaps as well as outliers their other advantage is the conservation of numerical information when dealing with larger data sets around 20 30 or more data points the related stemplot box plot or histogram may be more efficient as dot plots may become too cluttered after this point dot plots may be distinguished from histograms in that dots are not spaced uniformly along the horizontal axis although the plot appears

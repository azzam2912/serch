in addition to its literal meaning the term may be applied to a situation when the data written by one circuit can be read only by other circuitry the most common occurrence of the latter situation is when a processor writes data to a write only register of hardware the processor is controlling the hardware can read the instruction but the processor cannot this can lead to problems in producing device drivers for the hardware write only memories also find applications in security and cryptography as a means of preventing data being intercepted as it is being decrypted in 1972 wom an antithesis of read only memory rom was introduced as an inside practical joke perpetrated by signetics however it was soon recognized that this concept actually describes certain functionalities in microprocessor systems the most frequent occurrences of write only memories are where the memory locations are registers or an integrated circuit being used to control or pass information to hardware outside the processor a central processing unit cpu can write to these locations and thus control the hardware but cannot read back the information and discover the current state of the hardware the memory is write only relative only

it may or may not correspond to physical walls it is convenient to define the shape of the control volume so that all flow of matter in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface one may consider a process in which the matter flowing into and out of the system is chemically homogeneous then the inflowing matter performs work as if it were driving a piston of fluid into the system also the system performs work as if it were driving out a piston of fluid through the system walls that do not pass matter heat and work transfers may be defined including shaft work classical thermodynamics considers processes for a system that is initially and finally in its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium with no flow this is feasible also under some restrictions if the system is a mass of fluid flowing at a uniform rate then for many purposes a process called a flow process may be considered in accord with classical thermodynamics as if the classical rule of no flow were effective for the present introductory account it is supposed that the kinetic energy of flow and the potential energy of elevation in the gravity field

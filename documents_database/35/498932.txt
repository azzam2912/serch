15 arietis is the flamsteed designation it also bears the variable star designation av arietis it has an apparent visual magnitude of 5 74 which is just bright enough to be visible to the naked eye from dark suburban skies an annual parallax shift of 5 84 mas corresponds to a physical distance of approximately from earth at that distance the star s brightness is reduced by 0 33 in magnitude because of extinction from interstellar gas and dust this is a red giant star with a stellar classification of m3 iii the measured angular diameter of this star is at the estimated distance of delta ophiuchi this yields a physical size of about 67 times the radius of the sun the radius determined from the observed brightness and colour of the star is 15 arietis is a short period semiregular variable with the designation av arietis the period given in the general catalogue of variable stars is 5 032 days longterm photometry finds that the strongest pulsation period is 18 1 days with an amplitude of 0 028 magnitudes while a second is 21 9 days and 0 030 in magnitude end align

sympulse is a technology solution that represents the class of devices that performs digital symptom transference for the purpose of building empathy for a physiological condition the concept of eliciting empathy for a disease or symptom in someone that does not suffer that condition is known as tele empathy clinical empathy has long been known to be an important factor affecting patient outcome the goal of sympulse tele empathy devices is to use technology to accurately sense digitize and characterize symptoms in patients and also use different technologies to generate a physiological response in a non patient the process involves identifying a symptom of a disease and using various technologies to sense and digitize the condition this data is then used in conjunction with other technologies to elicit a physiological response representative of the symptom muscle activity data is collected from a parkinson s disease patient s forearm and signal analysis is performed on the time series waveforms to extract and characterize the underlying tremor muscle stimulation technology is then used to generate sequences of impulses that stimulate muscles in a non patient s forearm the patent pending experiential device induces involuntary muscle activity which mimics patient tremors and enables

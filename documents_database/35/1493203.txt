spurius lartius was one of the two companions of horatius who defended the pons sublicius against lars porsena in 508 bc a few years later titus lartius became the first roman dictator however the gens all but vanishes from history after this period a family of the same name existed in the late republic and under the early empire but their relationship to the earlier lartii is unknown the lartii were one of several noble families of etruscan origin during the early republic the nomen lartius is a patronymic surname based on the etruscan praenomen lars this name meaning lord is usually spelled larth in etruscan inscriptions but latin writers also used lars in place of the etruscan praenomina laris and larce apparently distinct names in etruscan the nomen is always spelled lartius in livius while dionysius alternates between larcius and largius all three forms appear on latin inscriptions the only praenomina associated with the lartii of the early republic are titus and spurius the larcii of the late republic and early empire used lucius and aulus according to dionysius the lartii at the outset of the republic bore the surname flavus however rufus is found in place of flavus

when there are no holes or added points triangulations form maximal outerplanar graphs over time a number of algorithms have been proposed to triangulate a polygon it is trivial to triangulate any convex polygon in linear time into a fan triangulation by adding diagonals from one vertex to all other vertices the total number of ways to triangulate a convex n gon by non intersecting diagonals is the n 2 th catalan number which equals formula 1 a solution found by leonhard euler a monotone polygon can be triangulated in linear time with either the algorithm of a fournier and d y montuno or the algorithm of godfried toussaint one way to triangulate a simple polygon is based on the two ears theorem as the fact that any simple polygon with at least 4 vertices without holes has at least two ears which are triangles with two sides being the edges of the polygon and the third one completely inside it the algorithm then consists of finding such an ear removing it from the polygon which results in a new polygon that still meets the conditions and repeating until there is only one triangle left this algorithm is easy to

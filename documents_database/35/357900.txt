these are mainly polymers synthesized from petroleum byproducts about of rubbers are produced annually and of that amount two thirds are synthetic global revenues generated with synthetic rubbers are likely to rise to approximately us 56 billion in 2020 synthetic rubber like natural rubber has uses in the automotive industry for tires door and window profiles hoses belts matting and flooring the expanded use of bicycles and particularly their pneumatic tires starting in the 1890s created increased demand for rubber in 1909 a team headed by fritz hofmann working at the bayer laboratory in elberfeld germany succeeded in polymerizing isoprene the first synthetic rubber the first rubber polymer synthesized from butadiene was created in 1910 by the russian scientist sergei vasiljevich lebedev this form of synthetic rubber provided the basis for the first large scale commercial production by the tsarist empire which occurred during world war i as a result of shortages of natural rubber this early form of synthetic rubber was again replaced with natural rubber after the war ended but investigations of synthetic rubber continued russian american ivan ostromislensky who moved to new york in 1922 did significant early research on synthetic rubber and a couple of monomers

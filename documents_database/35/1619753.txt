disciplines have combined to study and develop electromagnetic metamaterials some of these disciplines are optics physics electromagnetic theory including computational methods microfabrication microwaves nanofabrication nanotechnology and nanochemistry theory and phenomena of metamaterials is the first volume of the metamaterials handbook it contains contributions from researchers scientists who have produced accepted results in the field of metamaterials most of the contributors are associated with metamorphose vi aisbl a non profit european organization that focuses on artificial electromagnetic materials and metamaterials metamorphose provided access to the network of contributors researchers who work in a variety of scientific disciplines involved with metamaterials this book is in an article review format covering prior work in metamaterials it focuses on theories underpinning metamaterial research along with the properties of metamaterials the text covers all areas of metamaterial research applications of metamaterials is the second volume of the metamaterials handbook this book derives its organization for discussion of its topics from the previous volume theory modeling and basic properties of metamaterials that were explored in the first volume are now shown how they work when applied devices based on electromagnetic metamaterials continue to expand understanding of principles and modeling begun in the first volume the applications

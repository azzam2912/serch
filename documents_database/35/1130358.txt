like other members of this genus p profundum is a marine organism and has two circular chromosomes p profundum is a gram negative rod with the ability for growth at temperatures from 0 c to 25 c and pressures from 0 1 mpa to 70 mpa depending on the strain it has a requirement for salt is able to metabolise a wide range of simple and complex carbohydrates and has two flagella systems cells are rod shape 2 4 m long and 0 8 1 0 m wide with a single unsheathed flagella this bacterium was originally isolated in 1986 from the sulu sea and there are currently 4 cultured wild type strains of p profundum strains ss9 3tck djs4 and 1230 p profundum strain ss9 has optimal growth at 15 c and 28 mpa making it both a psychrophile and a piezophile p profundum strain 3tck isolates from san diego bay grows optimally at 9 c and 0 1 mpa and p profundum strain dsj4 isolated from the ryukyu trench off of japan at a depth of 5110 m grows optimally at 10 c and 10 mpa based on 16s rrna sequence p profundum is closely related to the

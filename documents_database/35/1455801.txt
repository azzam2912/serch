jump for joy is adderley s reinterpretation circa 1958 of a duke ellington stage musical from 1941 hearing adderley s often thrilling always well constructed alto sax improvisations over tunes like the standard i got it bad and that ain t good is reason enough for the album to exist and although russo s orchestral flourishes occasionally threaten to overwhelm the soloist especially on the closing the tune of the hickory stick they re always at the very least charming examples of 50s jazz pop arrangements the penguin guide to jazz gave the album a three star rating saying jump for joy puts cannonball with richard hayman s strings for the first half and it s not the happiest of combinations though the sheer alacrity of adderrley s sound energises some otherwise tepid writing the second half arranged by bill russo to accommodate a string quartet beside a familiar rhythm section works better

it belongs to the d1 like receptor family along with the d receptor subtype d receptor is a subtype of the dopamine receptor that has a 10 fold higher affinity for dopamine than the d subtype the d subtype is a g protein coupled receptor which promotes synthesis of camp by adenylyl cyclase via activation of g family of g proteins both d and d subtypes activate adenylyl cyclase d receptors were shown to stimulate monophasic dose dependent accumulation of camp in response to dopamine and the d receptors were able to stimulate biphasic accumulation of camp under the same conditions suggesting that d receptors may use a different system of secondary messengers than d receptors activation of d receptors is shown to promote expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and increase phosphorylation of protein kinase b in rat and mice prefrontal cortex neurons in vitro d receptors show high constitutive activity that is independent of binding any agonists d receptor is highly homologous to the d receptor their amino acid sequences are 49 to 80 identical d receptor has a long c terminus of 93 amino acids accounting for 26 of the entire protein in spite of the high

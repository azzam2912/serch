the approach also provides a framework for understanding and designing replication management protocols distributed software is often structured in terms of clients and services each service comprises one or more servers and exports operations that clients invoke by making requests although using a single centralized server is the simplest way to implement a service the resulting service can only be as fault tolerant as the processor executing that server if this level of fault tolerance is unacceptable then multiple servers that fail independently must be used usually replicas of a single server are executed on separate processors of a distributed system and protocols are used to coordinate client interactions with these replicas the physical and electrical isolation of processors in a distributed system ensures that server failures are independent as required for the subsequent discussion a state machine will be defined as the following tuple of values see also mealy machine and moore machine a state machine begins at the state labeled start each input received is passed through the transition and output function to produce a new state and an output the state is held stable until a new input is received while the output is communicated to the

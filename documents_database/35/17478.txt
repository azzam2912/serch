these measurements can be used to locate weather fronts monitor the el ni o southern oscillation determine the strength of tropical cyclones study urban heat islands and monitor the global climate wildfires volcanos and industrial hot spots can also be found via thermal imaging from weather satellites weather satellites do not measure temperature directly they measure radiances in various wavelength bands since 1978 microwave sounding units msus on national oceanic and atmospheric administration polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen which is related to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere measurements of infrared radiation pertaining to sea surface temperature have been collected since 1967 satellite datasets show that over the past four decades the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled both of these trends are consistent with the influence of increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases satellites do not measure temperature they measure radiances in various wavelength bands which must then be mathematically inverted to obtain indirect inferences of temperature the resulting temperature profiles depend on details of the methods that are used to obtain temperatures from radiances as a result different groups that have analyzed the satellite

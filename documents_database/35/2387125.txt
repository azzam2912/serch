it has application in facility location and clustering basically the vertex k center problem models the following real problem given a city with formula 1 facilities find the best formula 2 facilities where to build fire stations since firemen must attend any emergency as quickly as possible the distance from the farthests facility to its nearest fire station has to be as small as possible in other words the position of the fire stations must be such that every possible fire is attended as quickly as possible the vertex k center problem is a classical np hard problem in computer science it was first proposed by hakimi in 1964 formally the vertex k center problem consists in given a complete undirected graph formula 3 in a metric space and a positive integer formula 2 find a subset formula 5 such that formula 6 and the objective function formula 7 is minimized the distance formula 8 is defined as the distance from the vertex formula 9 to its nearest center in formula 10 if formula 11 the vertex k center problem can not be optimally solved in polynomial time however there are some polynomial time algorithms that get near optimal solutions

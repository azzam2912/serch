solar energy is the most promising renewable energy source due to its ability to drive the more popular thermal desalination systems directly through solar collectors and to drive physical and chemical desalination systems indirectly through photovoltaic cells direct solar desalination produces distillate directly in the solar collector an example would be a solar still which traps the sun s energy to obtain freshwater through the process of evaporation and condensation indirect solar desalination incorporates solar energy collection systems with conventional desalination systems such as multi stage flash distillation multiple effect evaporation freeze separation or reverse osmosis to produce freshwater one type of solar desalination unit is a solar still it is also similar to a condensation trap a solar still is a simple way of distilling water using the heat of the sun to drive evaporation from humid soil and ambient air to cool a condenser film two basic types of solar stills are box and pit stills in a solar still impure water is contained outside the collector where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic the pure water vapor condenses on the cool inside plastic surface and drips down from the weighted low point where it

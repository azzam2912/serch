examples include technetium 95 and promethium 146 many of these are found in and harvested from spent nuclear fuel assemblies some must be manufactured in particle accelerators some synthetic radioisotopes are extracted from spent nuclear reactor fuel rods which contain various fission products for example it is estimated that up to 1994 about 49 000 terabecquerels 78 metric ton of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium some synthetic isotopes are produced in significant quantities by fission but are not yet being reclaimed other isotopes are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes in a nuclear reactor for example tc 97 can be made by neutron irradiation of ru 96 or by bombarding parent isotopes with high energy particles from a particle accelerator many isotopes are produced in cyclotrons for example fluorine 18 and oxygen 15 which are widely used for positron emission tomography most synthetic radioisotopes have a short half life though a health hazard radioactive materials have many medical and industrial uses the field of nuclear medicine covers use of radioisotopes for diagnosis or treatment radioactive tracer compounds radiopharmaceuticals are used to observe the function of various organs and

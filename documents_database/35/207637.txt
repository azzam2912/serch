this problem first posed in the early 19th century is unsolved there are some permutation groups for which generic polynomials are known which define all algebraic extensions of having a particular group as galois group these groups include all of degree no greater than there also are groups known not to have generic polynomials such as the cyclic group of order more generally let be a given finite group and let be a field then the question is this is there a galois extension field such that the galois group of the extension is isomorphic to one says that is realizable over if such a field exists there is a great deal of detailed information in particular cases it is known that every finite group is realizable over any function field in one variable over the complex numbers and more generally over function fields in one variable over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero igor shafarevich showed that every finite solvable group is realizable over it is also known that every sporadic group except possibly the mathieu group is realizable over david hilbert had shown that this question is related to a rationality question for here rational means that

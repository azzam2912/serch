organocobalt compounds are involved in several organic reactions and the important biomolecule vitamin b has a cobalt carbon bond many organocobalt compounds exhibit useful catalytic properties the preeminent example being dicobalt octacarbonyl dicobalt octacarbonyl reacts with hydrogen and alkenes to give aldehydes this reaction is the basis of hydroformylation the formation of aldehydes from an alkene co and hydrogen a key intermediate is cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride hco co the original ruhrchemie process produced propanal from ethene and syngas using cobalt carbonyl has been displaced by rhodium based catalysts processes involving cobalt are practiced by basf exxon and shell mainly for the production of c7 c14 alcohols used for the production of surfactants in hydrocarboxylations hydrogen is replaced by water or an alcohol and the reaction product is a carboxylic acid or an ester an example of this reaction type is the conversion of butadiene to adipic acid cobalt catalysts together with iron are relevant in the fischer tropsch process in which it is assumed that organocobalt intermediates form dicobalt octacarbonyl also reacts with alkynes to give tetrahedranes of the formula co co cr because the cobalt carbonyl centers can be removed later it functions as a protective group for the

there are 8 special registers program counter interrupt stack pointer isp interrupt vector address register intbase status register psr configuration register and 3 debug registers status register implements flags c t l f z n e p i instructions are encoded in two address form in several formats usually they have 16 bit encoding but there are two formats for medium immediate instructions with length of 32 bit typical opcode length is 4 bits bits 9 12 of most encoding types basic encoding formats are register to register short 5 bit immediate value to register medium immediate of 16 bit value to register 32 bit encoding load store relative with short 5 bit displacement 2 bit opcode load store relative with medium 18 bit displacement 32 bit encoding 2 bit opcode cr16c comes with a different opcode encoding format has 23 32bits wide address registers and provides two 32bit general purpose registers cr16 implements traps and interrupts implementations of cr16 has three stage pipeline fetch decode execute cr16 was used in several national semiconductor microcontrollers and since 2001 integrated microcontrollers were available having built in flash memory since 2007 cr16 based ip was available to licensing

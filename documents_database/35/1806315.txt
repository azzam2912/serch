they are parallels of base set issues and were introduced with the release of the 1993 topps finest baseball set later releases have confirmation of a refractor on the back of the card in the form of either an r or the word refractor printed usually beside or beneath the card number but the first refractors did not include this designation and are therefore sometimes more difficult to differentiate from base issues there are many refractor variants that have been produced over the years though most are simple color swaps of the base refractors these variants are typically serial numbered but that is not always the case the very first refractor variant that was available was the embossed refractor in 1997 variants that typically appear in topps finest topps chrome and bowman chrome releases often include gold blue red orange green and black less often refractor color variants including pink purple and white can be found usually the orange and red refractor parallels are extremely rare and have low serial numbers while the blue and green ones are more common this is not always the case though and tends to vary slightly from set to set and year to year

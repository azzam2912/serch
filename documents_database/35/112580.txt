a nephelometer measures suspended particulates by employing a light beam source beam and a light detector set to one side often 90 of the source beam particle density is then a function of the light reflected into the detector from the particles to some extent how much light reflects for a given density of particles is dependent upon properties of the particles such as their shape color and reflectivity nephelometers are calibrated to a known particulate then use environmental factors k factors to compensate lighter or darker colored dusts accordingly k factor is determined by the user by running the nephelometer next to an air sampling pump and comparing results there are a wide variety of research grade nephelometers on the market as well as open source varieties the main uses of nephelometers relate to air quality measurement for pollution monitoring climate monitoring and visibility airborne particles are commonly either biological contaminants particulate contaminants gaseous contaminants or dust the chart to the left shows the types and sizes of various particulate contaminants this information is helpful toward understanding the character of particulate pollution inside a building or in the ambient air it is also useful for understanding the cleanliness level

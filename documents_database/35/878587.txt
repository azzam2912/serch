the deep ecliptic survey des list this trans neptunian object as a twotino that stays in a 1 2 orbital resonance with the planet neptune for every one orbit that a twotino makes neptune orbits twice the observations with the infrared spitzer space telescope combined with the orbits established using the hubble telescope allow the estimation of the density assuming the components of equal albedo the resulting estimate of is similar to the density of the binary plutino 47171 lempo 0 3 0 8 g cm and saturn s moon hyperion such a low density is indicative of a highly porous composition dominated by ice on 22 december 2001 a minor planet moon provisionally designated was discovered by american astronomer michael brown and chad trujillo using the hubble space telescope the discovery was announced in january 2002 the satellite measures approximately in diameter and orbits its primary at a distance of assuming a circular orbit this takes days to complete one orbit this minor planet was numbered by the minor planet center on 5 july 2001 as of 2018 it has not been named

a floating timeline is a subtle form of retroactive continuity this is seen most clearly in the case of comic book characters who debuted as teens in the 1940s or the 1960s but who are still relatively young in current comics events from the characters pasts are alluded to but they are changed from having taken place years ago to having taken place more recently a floating timeline is usually accomplished by avoiding referencing specific dates for events in the character s lives instead all references are relative to the present of the story for example instead of referencing an event as happening in the story would refer to it happening two years ago a floating timeline is uncommon in live action movies and television where the aging of the actors usually renders the floating timeline moot however floating timelines are often used on soap operas where it has become acceptable to replace actors allowing for many characters to exist for decades without aging much a floating timeline is usually abstracted from that of actual historical events but may contain subtle references to the real world timelines there may also be attempts made to maintain certain characters historic timelines if

it is terminologically but not always numerically equivalent to power density when measured in si units of w kg regardless of the units used energy rate density describes the flow of energy through any system of given mass and has been proposed as a measure of system complexity the more complex the system the more energy flows per second through each gram energy rate density is actually a general term that is equivalent to more specialized terms used by many different disciplinary scientists for example in astronomy it is called the luminosity to mass ratio the inverse of the mass luminosity ratio in physics the power density in geology the specific radiant flux where specific denotes per unit mass in biology the specific metabolic rate and in engineering the power to weight ratio interdisciplinary researchers prefer to use the general term energy rate density not only to stress the intuitive notion of energy flow in contrast to more colloquial connotations of the word power but also to unify its potential application among all the natural sciences as in the cosmology of cosmic evolution when the energy rate density for systems including our galaxy sun earth plants animals society are plotted

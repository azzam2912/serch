the term fluidics is normally used when devices have no moving parts so ordinary hydraulic components such as hydraulic cylinders and spool valves are not considered or referred to as fluidic devices a jet of fluid can be deflected by a weaker jet striking it at the side this provides nonlinear amplification similar to the transistor used in electronic digital logic it is used mostly in environments where electronic digital logic would be unreliable as in systems exposed to high levels of electromagnetic interference or ionizing radiation nanotechnology considers fluidics as one of its instruments in this domain effects such as fluid solid and fluid fluid interface forces are often highly significant fluidics have also been used for military applications in 1957 billy m horton of the harry diamond laboratories which later became a part of the army research laboratory first came up with the idea for the fluidic amplifier when he realized that he could redirect the direction of flue gases using a small bellows he proposed a theory on stream interaction stating that one can achieve amplification by deflecting a stream of fluid with a different stream of fluid in 1959 horton and his associates dr r e

aluminium amalgam may be prepared by either grinding aluminium pellets or wire in mercury or by allowing aluminium wire to react with a solution of mercury ii chloride in water this amalgam is used as a chemical reagent to reduce compounds such as the reduction of imines to amines the aluminium is the ultimate electron donor and the mercury serves to mediate the electron transfer the reaction itself and the waste from it contain mercury so special safety precautions and disposal methods are needed as an environmentally friendlier alternative hydrides or other reducing agents can often be used to accomplish the same synthetic result another environmentally friendly alternative is an alloy of aluminium and gallium which similarly renders the aluminium more reactive by preventing it from forming an oxide layer aluminium in air is ordinarily protected by a molecule thin layer of its own oxide this aluminium oxide layer serves as a protective barrier to the underlying aluminium itself and prevents chemical reactions with the metal mercury coming into contact with it does no harm however if any elemental aluminium is exposed even by a recent scratch the mercury may combine with it to form the amalgam this process can

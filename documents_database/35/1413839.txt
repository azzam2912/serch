it was operated by the northland mining company during the early 1900s with the construction of a shaft and many open cuts north of the shaft minerals present at the mine include chalcopyrite pyrite and pyrrhotite deposited in precambrian volcanic rock of the canadian shield before the operation of northland pyrite mine in the early 1900s water levels of james lake increased and decreased the cause of this alternation could have been caused by beavers building dams in the lake s outlet eventually causing the water levels to rise this rise in water levels began to cease in 1906 when operations of the northland pyrite mine began to dump volcanic waste rock along the southwestern shore of james lake this began with the construction of the shaft and the several open cuts north of the shaft but the mine site was originally discovered in 1903 erosion of the volcanic waste rock resulted in the development of acidic lake wastewaters next to the waste pile causing organisms around the mine to disappear the name harris mine was coined for northland pyrite mine by e l fraleck in 1907 when northland was actively operating for a year from february 1906 to march

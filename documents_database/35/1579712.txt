the traditional approach to the development of structures is to address the loadcarrying function and other functional requirements separately recently however there has been increased interest in the development of load bearing materials and structures which have integral non load bearing functions guided by recent discoveries about how multifunctional biological systems work with conventional structural materials it has been difficult to achieve simultaneous improvement in multiple structural functions but the increasing use of composite materials has been driven in part by the potential for such improvements the multi functions can vary from mechanical to electrical and thermal functions the most widely used composites have polymer matrix materials which are typically poor conductors enhanced conductivity could be achieved with reinforcing the composite with carbon nanotubes for instance among the many functions that can be attained are electrical thermal conductivity sensing and actuation energy harvesting storage self healing capability electromagnetic interference emi shielding and recyclability and biodegradability see also functionally graded materials fgm which are composite materials where the composition or the microstructure are locally varied so that a certain variation of the local material properties is achieved however fgm can be designed for specific function and applications many applications such as

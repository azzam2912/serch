the cloud was discovered in 1963 by gail bieger n e smith who was an astronomy student at leiden university in the netherlands using the national science foundation s robert c byrd green bank telescope radio astronomers have found that smith s cloud has a mass of at least one million solar masses and measures long by wide in projection the cloud is between and from earth and has an angular diameter of 10 to 12 degrees approximately as wide as the orion constellation or about 20 times the diameter of the full moon although the cloud is not visible to the naked eye the cloud is apparently moving towards the disk of the milky way at 73 26 kilometers per second smith s cloud is expected to merge with the milky way in 27 million years at a point in the perseus arm astronomers believe it will strike the milky way disk at a 45 angle and its impact may produce a burst of star formation or a supershell of neutral hydrogen projecting the cloud s trajectory backwards through time it is estimated that it had passed through the disk of the milky way some 70 million years ago

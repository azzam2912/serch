such headshunts are typically installed at a terminal station to allow the locomotive of an arriving train to move to the opposite end of in railway parlance run around its train so that it can then haul the same train out of the station in the other direction assuming of course that it is a locomotive equipped to run in either direction for older one way equipment such as steam locomotives and cab unit locomotives a wye or turntable needs to be provided to physically turn the engine around as well as a run around track found primarily on metro systems rapid transit light rail networks and tramways a reversing headshunt allows certain trains or trams to change direction even on lines with high traffic flow whilst others continue through the station typically there will be two running lines one for each direction of travel and the headshunt will be positioned between the two running lines linked to both by points although most trains will pass through the station and continue in the same direction an individual train may be directed into the reversing headshunt before exiting onto the other running line in the opposite direction of travel this procedure

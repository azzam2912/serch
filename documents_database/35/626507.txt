the colourless or white solid is the simplest molecular boron nitrogen hydride compound it has attracted attention as a source of hydrogen fuel but is otherwise primarily of academic interest reaction of diborane with ammonia mainly gives the diammoniate salt hb nh bh ammonia borane is the main product when an adduct of borane is employed in place of diborane the molecule adopts a structure like ethane with which it is isoelectronic the b n distance is 1 58 2 the b h and n h distances are 1 15 and 0 96 respectively its similarity to ethane is tenuous since ammonia borane is a solid and ethane is a gas their melting points differing by 284 c this difference is consistent with the highly polar nature of ammonia borane the h atoms attached to boron are hydridic and those attached to nitrogen are somewhat acidic the structure of the solid indicates a close association of the n h and the b h centers the closest h h distance is 1 990 which can be compared with the h h bonding distance of 0 74 this interaction is called a dihydrogen bond the original crystallographic analysis of this compound reversed

unlike mother s day and father s day it is not federally recognized the u s holiday was originally conceived by smokey robinson to honor his relationship with his six daughters in human development the relationship between fathers and sons overshadows the bond with daughters this holiday promotes the development of young women through their father robinson stated there are many different kinds of families today and we know that all parental relationships are important to the healthy development of children but the father daughter bond is unique and one that is near to my heart the father daughter relationship shapes a young woman s perspective of men and what to expect from them i believe that female empowerment begins in the home and fathers must set a healthy example through their personal actions and interactions examples of commemoration during father daughter day can be both commercial or intangible nonmaterial examples of observances during this day include embracing one another with hugs spending quality time together and honoring their presence in your life in september 2017 rockabye baby music released a lullaby version of smokey robinson s my girl to support the holiday in october 2017 greeting card company american

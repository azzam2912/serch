high concentration 0 5m 2 0m of reactants give the highest yields polar aprotic solvents like dmf work well however methanol and ethanol have also been used successfully this uncatalyzed reaction has an inherent high atom economy as only a molecule of water is lost and the chemical yield in general is high several reviews have been published due to the reaction products being potential protein mimetics there have been many attempts to development an enantioselective ugi reaction the first successful report of which was in 2018 one plausible reaction mechanism is depicted below amine 1 and ketone 2 form the imine 3 with loss of one equivalent of water proton exchange with carboxylic acid 4 activates the iminium ion 5 for nucleophilic addition of the isocyanide 6 with its terminal carbon atom to nitrilium ion 7 a second nucleophilic addition takes place at this intermediate with the carboxylic acid anion to 8 the final step is a mumm rearrangement with transfer of the r4 acyl group from oxygen to nitrogen all reaction steps are reversible except for the mumm rearrangement which drives the whole reaction sequence in the related passerini reaction lacking the amine the isocyanide reacts directly with

it is a foundational result in several fields the chief among them being symplectic geometry the theorem is named after jean gaston darboux who established it as the solution of the pfaff problem one of the many consequences of the theorem is that any two symplectic manifolds of the same dimension are locally symplectomorphic to one another that is every 2 n dimensional symplectic manifold can be made to look locally like the linear symplectic space c with its canonical symplectic form there is also an analogous consequence of the theorem as applied to contact geometry the precise statement is as follows suppose that formula 1 is a differential 1 form on an n dimensional manifold such that formula 2 has constant rank p if then there is a local system of coordinates formula 4 in which if on the other hand then there is a local system of coordinates formula 4 in which note that if formula 6 everywhere and formula 10 then formula 11 is a contact form in particular suppose that formula 12 is a symplectic 2 form on an n 2 m dimensional manifold m in a neighborhood of each point p of m by the

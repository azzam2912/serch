it is a type of perimetry vision abnormalities such as metamorphopsia distortions and scotoma are symptoms of retinal diseases such as macular degeneration in advanced stages of the disease photoreceptor cells may be irreversibly damaged hence if not treated macular degeneration may lead to blindness awareness to early changes in vision especially in high risk patients leads to early treatment such as intravitreal injection of anti vegf factors e g bevacizumab or ranibizumab and prevents loss of vision because of complex brain mechanisms such as filling in patients with small and peripheral defects in their vision are often unaware of such changes until late stages in the disease another problem is that minute visual aberrations can be normal and therefore should be distinguished from genuine visual abnormalities preferential hyperacuity perimetry php is a technology that bypasses filling in and quantifies the extent of visual abnormalities php takes advantage of visual hyperacuity also known as vernier acuity the ability to identify the misalignment of visual objects visual hyperacuity is at least 10 times more sensitive than visual acuity the ability to separate between distinct objects therefore in retinal diseases such as macular degeneration responses to hyperacuity stimuli may be abnormal long

historically it was also used to help perform an emergency stop should the main hydraulic brakes fail parking brakes often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes which is then connected to a pulling mechanism in most vehicles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels which have reduced traction while braking the mechanism may be a hand operated lever a straight pull handle located near the steering column or a foot operated pedal located with the other pedals in vehicles with automatic transmissions the parking brake was originally intended for emergency stopping for instance if the foot brake completely failed due to a loss of hydraulic pressure or other malfunction as safety regulations became stringent in the 1980s and modern brake systems became more reliable using dual circuit hydraulics and low brake fluid sensors modern brakes no longer cause emergencies in normal contexts a brake warning light appears on the dashboard if there was a problem it is no longer as necessary for a driver to use this brake for emergencies although if it were to be used the parking brake lever should be slowly engaged to help reduce speed while most automatic transmission vehicles have

epsps catalyzes the chemical reaction thus the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphoenolpyruvate pep and 3 phospho shikimate whereas its two products are phosphate and 5 enolpyruvylshikimate 3 phosphate this enzyme is not present in animals so it presents an attractive biological target for herbicides such as glyphosate a glyphosate resistant version of this gene has been used in genetically modified crops the enzyme belongs to the family of transferases to be specific those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups the systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoenolpyruvate 3 phosphoshikimate 5 o 1 carboxyvinyl transferase other names in common use include epsp synthase is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of about 46 000 it is composed of two domains which are joined by protein strands this strand acts as a hinge and can bring the two protein domains closer together when a substrate binds to the enzyme ligand bonding causes the two parts of the enzyme to clamp down around the substrate in the active site epsp synthase has been divided into two groups according to glyphosate sensitivity class i enzyme contained in plants and in some bacteria is inhibited at low micromolar

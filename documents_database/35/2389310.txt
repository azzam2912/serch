the other objectives are fault tolerance and application matching the term multiprocessor can be confused with the term multiprocessing while multiprocessing is a type of processing in which two or more processors work together to execute multiple programs simultaneously multiprocessor refers to a hardware architecture that allows multiprocessing multiprocessor systems are classified according to how processor memory access is handled and whether system processors are of a single type or various ones there are many types of multiprocessor systems in loosely coupled multiprocessor systems each processor has its own local memory input output i o channels and operating system processors exchange data over a high speed communication network by sending messages via a technique known as message passing loosely coupled multiprocessor systems are also known as distributed memory systems as the processors do not share physical memory and have individual i o channels multiprocessor system with a shared memory closely connected to the processors a symmetric multiprocessing system is a system with centralized shared memory called main memory mm operating under a single operating system with two or more homogeneous processors there are two types of systems a heterogeneous multiprocessing system contains multiple but not homogeneous processing units central processing

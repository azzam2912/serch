for example the language 1 111 1111 is unary as is the language 1 k is prime the complexity class of all such languages is sometimes called tally the name unary comes from the fact that a unary language is the encoding of a set of natural numbers in the unary numeral system since the universe of strings over any finite alphabet is a countable set every language can be mapped to a unique set a of natural numbers thus every language has a unary version 1 k in a conversely every unary language has a more compact binary version the set of binary encodings of natural numbers k such that 1 is in the language since complexity is usually measured in terms of the length of the input string the unary version of a language can be easier than the original language for example if a language can be recognized in o 2 time its unary version can be recognized in o n time because n has become exponentially larger more generally if a language can be recognized in o f n time and o g n space its unary version can be recognized in o n f log

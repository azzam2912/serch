this allows both a physically smaller and less expensive implementation of essentially the same functionality over time the physical address range of the q bus was expanded from 16 to 18 and then 22 bits block transfer modes were also added to the q bus like the unibus before it the q bus uses memory mapped i o means that data cycles between any two devices whether cpu memory or i o devices use the same protocols on the unibus a range of physical addresses are dedicated for i o devices the q bus simplifies this design by providing a specific signal originally called bbs7 bus bank select 7 but later generalized to be called bbsio bus bank select i o that selects the range of addresses used by the i o devices byte addressing means that the physical address passed on the unibus is interpreted as the address of a byte sized quantity of data because the bus actually contains a data path that is two bytes wide address bit 0 is subject to special interpretation and data on the bus has to travel in the correct byte lanes a strict master slave relationship means that at any point

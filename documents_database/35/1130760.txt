pikfyve activity is responsible for the production of both ptdins 3 5 p2 and phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate ptdins5p pikfyve is a large protein containing a number of functional domains and expressed in several spliced forms the reported full length mouse and human cdna clones encode proteins of 2052 and 2098 amino acid residues respectively by directly binding membrane ptdins 3 p the fyve finger domain of pikfyve is essential in localizing the protein to the cytosolic leaflet of endosomes impaired pikfyve enzymatic activity by dominant interfering mutants sirna mediated ablation or pharmacological inhibition causes lysosome enlargement and cytoplasmic vacuolation due to impaired ptdins 3 5 p2 synthesis and impaired lysosome fission process and homeostasis thus via ptdins 3 5 p2 production pikfyve participates in several aspects of vesicular dynamics thereby affecting a number of trafficking pathways that emanate from or traverse the endosomal system en route to the trans golgi network or later compartments along the endocytic pathway pikfyve mutations affecting one of the two pikfyve alleles are found in 8 out of 10 families with francois neetens corneal fleck dystrophy disruption of both pikfyve alleles in the mouse is lethal at the stage of pre implantation embryo pikfyve s

1 a whole new consistent set of astronomical constants recommended for reduction of astronomical observations and for computation of ephemerides it superseded the iau s previous recommendations of 1964 see iau 1964 system of astronomical constants became in effect in the astronomical almanac from 1984 onward and remained in use until the introduction of the iau 2009 system of astronomical constants in 1994 the iau recognized that the parameters became outdated but retained the 1976 set for sake of continuity but also recommended to start maintaining a set of current best estimates this sub group for numerical standards had published a list which included new constants like those for relativistic time scales the system of constants was prepared by commission 4 on ephemerides led by p kenneth seidelmann after whom asteroid 3217 seidelmann is named at the time a new standard epoch j2000 0 was accepted followed later by a new reference system with fundamental catalogue fk5 and expressions for precession of the equinoxes and in 1979 by new expressions for the relation between universal time and sidereal time and in 1979 and 1980 by a theory of nutation there were no reliable rotation elements for most planets but a

the crash killed several of the college students and all but one of the adults who was badly injured and later died the surviving students were the only human life remaining on the island the island was unusual in that it had been built up as a site for a potential above ground nuclear test which never took place leaving all of the buildings and improbably supplies untouched and ready for use by the survivors the trip to southeast asia was a goodwill tour arranged by the state department showcasing what american youth were like but it went awry when one of the students disrupted it feeling that what they were doing was fake and a way to gloss over what was going on in the country and with relations to the vietnam war the new people reflected the youth oriented counterculture of the 1960s all people over 30 were now dead and it was up to the young people to start a new society on the island the pilot episode was written by rod serling credited as john phillips this program is an extremely rare example of a regularly scheduled network television series with 45 minute long episodes it

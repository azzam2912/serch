locating the desired item in such a list by the linear search method inevitably requires a number of operations proportional to the number n of items in the worst case as well as in the average case useful search data structures allow faster retrieval however they are limited to queries of some specific kind moreover since the cost of building such structures is at least proportional to n they only pay off if several queries are to be performed on the same database or on a database that changes little between queries static search structures are designed for answering many queries on a fixed database dynamic structures also allow insertion deletion or modification of items between successive queries in the dynamic case one must also consider the cost of fixing the search structure to account for the changes in the database the simplest kind of query is to locate a record that has a specific field the key equal to a specified value v other common kinds of query are find the item with smallest or largest key value find the item with largest key value not exceeding v find all items with key values between specified bounds v and

it was introduced in 1995 as a termite baiting system and an alternative to liquid termiticide soil barriers it eliminates all members of the termite colony including those of the formosan subterranean termite colonies the baiting technique employed by the sentricon system takes advantage of termite biology and behavior subterranean worker termites forage for cellulose food sources 24 hours a day ranging abroad from their underground nest or colony through tunnels in the soil that can range up to 300 feet or more when worker termites find a food source they leave a pheromone scent trail to summon nest mates worker termites chew and digest cellulose and then regurgitate it to share with other termites in the colony a certified sentricon specialist css who is trained and certified by dow agrosciences installs sentricon bait stations in the soil creating a protective perimeter around a property csss provide an ongoing service to stations even after a colony is eliminated to prevent re infestation by other colonies and ensure continued protection these stations are baited with a cellulose material impregnated with noviflumuron a chitin synthesis inhibitor when foraging worker termites find the stations eat the bait material and then regurgitate this bait

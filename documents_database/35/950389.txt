oxygen evolution from water is effected by oxygenic photosynthesis electrolysis of water and thermal decomposition of various oxides the biological process supports aerobic life when relatively pure oxygen is required industrially it is isolated by distillation of liquified air photosynthetic oxygen evolution is the fundamental process by which oxygen is generated in earth s biosphere the reaction is part of the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of green algae and plants it utilizes the energy of light to split a water molecule into its protons and electrons for photosynthesis free oxygen generated as a by product of this reaction is released into the atmosphere water oxidation is catalyzed by a manganese containing cofactor contained in photosystem ii known as the oxygen evolving complex oec or water splitting complex manganese is an important cofactor and calcium and chloride are also required for the reaction to occur the stoichiometry this reaction follows the protons are released into the thylakoid lumen thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane this proton gradient is the driving force for atp synthesis via photophosphorylation and coupling the absorption of light energy and oxidation of water to

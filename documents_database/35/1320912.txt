it is an indicator of the suitability of water for use in agricultural irrigation as determined from the concentrations of the main alkaline and earth alkaline cations present in the water it is also a standard diagnostic parameter for the sodicity hazard of a soil as determined from analysis of pore water extracted from the soil the formula for calculating the sodium adsorption ratio sar is where sodium calcium and magnesium concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents liter sar allows assessment of the state of flocculation or of dispersion of clay aggregates in a soil sodium and potassium ions facilitate the dispersion of clay particles while calcium and magnesium promote their flocculation the behaviour of clay aggregates influences the soil structure and affects the permeability of the soil whose directly depends the water infiltration rate it is important to accurately know the nature and the concentrations of cations at which the flocculation occurs critical flocculation concentration cfc the sar parameter is also used to determine the stability of colloids in suspension in water although sar is only one factor in determining the suitability of water for irrigation in general the higher the sodium adsorption ratio the less suitable the water is

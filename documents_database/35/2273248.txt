lebovitz consider a fluid mass formula 1 of volume formula 2 with density formula 3 and an isotropic pressure formula 4 with vanishing pressure at the bounding surfaces here formula 5 refers to a frame of reference attached to the center of mass before describing the virial equations let s define some moments the density moments are defined as the pressure moments are the kinetic energy moments are and the chandrasekhar potential energy tensor moments are chandrasekhar assumed that the fluid mass is subjected to pressure force and its own gravitational force then the euler equations is in steady state the equation becomes in steady state the equation becomes the euler equations in a rotating frame of reference rotating with an angular velocity formula 16 is given by where formula 18 is the levi civita symbol formula 19 is the centrifugal acceleration and formula 20 is the coriolis acceleration in steady state the second order virial equation becomes if the axis of rotation is chosen in formula 22 direction the equation becomes and chandrasekhar shows that in this case the tensors can take only the following form in steady state the third order virial equation becomes if the axis of

he became a research student of john edensor littlewood working on the question of the distribution of quadratic residues the attack on the distribution question leads quickly to problems that are now seen to be special cases of those on local zeta functions for the particular case of some special hyperelliptic curves such as formula 1 bounds for the zeroes of the local zeta function immediately imply bounds for sums formula 2 where is the legendre symbol modulo a prime number p and the sum is taken over a complete set of residues mod p in the light of this connection it was appropriate that with a trinity research fellowship davenport in 1932 1933 spent time in marburg and g ttingen working with helmut hasse an expert on the algebraic theory this produced the work on the hasse davenport relations for gauss sums and contact with hans heilbronn with whom davenport would later collaborate in fact as davenport later admitted his inherent prejudices against algebraic methods what can you do with algebra probably limited the amount he learned in particular in the new algebraic geometry and artin noether approach to abstract algebra he took an appointment at the university of

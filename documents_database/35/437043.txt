it may be congenital surgically created for hemodialysis treatments or acquired due to pathologic process such as trauma or erosion of an arterial aneurysm just like berry aneurysm an intracerebral arteriovenous fistula can rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage when an arteriovenous fistula is formed involving a major artery like the abdominal aorta it can lead to a large decrease in peripheral resistance this lowered peripheral resistance causes the heart to increase cardiac output to maintain proper blood flow to all tissues the physical manifestations of this would be a relatively normal systolic blood pressure with a decreased diastolic blood pressure resulting in a wide pulse pressure normal blood flow in the brachial artery is 85 to 110 milliliters per minute ml min after the creation of a fistula the blood flow increases to 400 500 ml min immediately and 700 1 000 ml min within 1 month a brachiocephalic fistula above the elbow has a greater flow rate than a radiocephalic fistula at the wrist both the artery and the vein dilate and elongate in response to the greater blood flow and shear stress but the vein dilates more and becomes arterialized in one study the cephalic vein increased from 2

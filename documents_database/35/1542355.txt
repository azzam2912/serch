peptides or proteins are labeled with various chemical groups that are at least nominally identical masses isobaric but vary in terms of distribution of heavy isotopes around their structure these tags commonly referred to as tandem mass tags are designed so that the mass tag is cleaved at a specific linker region upon high energy cid hcd during tandem mass spectrometry yielding reporter ions of different masses the most common isobaric tags are amine reactive tags however tags that react with cysteine residues and carbonyl groups have also been described these amine reactive groups go through n hydroxysuccinimide nhs reactions which are based around three types of functional groups isobaric labeling methods include tandem mass tags tmt isobaric tags for absolute and relative quantification itraq mass differential tags for absolute and relative quantification and dimethyl labeling tmts and itraq methods are most common and developed of these methods tandem mass tags have a mass reporter region a cleavable linker region a mass normalization region and a protein reactive group and have the same total mass a typical bottom up proteomics workflow is described by yates 2014 protein samples are enzymatically digested by a protease to produce peptides each digested experimental

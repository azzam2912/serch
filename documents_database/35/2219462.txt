the first synthesis was described by karl dimroth and coworkers in 1961 it is one of the three isomers of the benzoxepins 3 benzoxepin itself is a non natural compound but the bicyclic ring system is part of the naturally occurring compounds perilloxin i from perilla frutescens variant acuta and tenual ii and tenucarb iii from asphodeline tenuior perilloxin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase with an ic of 23 2 m non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen also work by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme family unsubstituted 3 benzoxepin can be synthesized through a double wittig reaction from o phthalaldehyde with bis triphenylphosphonium dimethylether dibromide the latter compound can be synthesized from dibromodimethyl ether bis bromomethyl ether or bbme which is accessible from hydrobromic acid paraformaldehyde and triphenylphosphine the reaction is performed in dry methanol with sodium methoxide and the product is obtained in 55 yield the compound can also be obtained through uv irratiation of certain naphthalene derivatives such as 1 4 epoxy 1 4 dihydronaphthalene it can also be obtained by photooxidation of 1 4 dihydronaphthalene followed by pyrolysis of the formed hydroperoxides the latter syntheses give 3 benzoxepins in low yields 4 6 3 benzoxepin is

e j brouwer bar induction s main use is the intuitionistic derivation of the fan theorem a key result used in the derivation of the uniform continuity theorem it is also useful in giving constructive alternatives to other classical results the goal of the principle is to prove properties for all infinite sequences of natural numbers called choice sequences in intuitionistic terminology by inductively reducing them to properties of finite lists bar induction can also be used to prove properties about all choice sequences in a spread a special kind of set given a choice sequence formula 1 any finite sequence of elements formula 2 of this sequence is called an initial segment of this choice sequence there are three forms of bar induction currently in the literature each one places certain restrictions on a pair of predicates and the key differences are highlighted using bold font given two predicates formula 3 and formula 4 on finite sequences of natural numbers such that all of the following conditions hold then we can conclude that formula 4 holds for the empty sequence i e a holds for all choice sequences starting with the empty sequence this principle of bar induction is

the compartment may be large enough to fully accommodate the divers above the water or may be smaller and just accommodate head and shoulders internal air pressure is at the pressure of the free water surface and varies accordingly with depth the breathing gas supply for the open bell may be self contained or more usually supplied from the surface via flexible hose which may be combined with other hoses and cables as a bell umbilical an open bell may also contain a breathing gas distribution panel with divers umbilicals to supply divers with breathing gas during excursions from the bell and an on board emergency gas supply in high pressure storage cylinders this type of diving chamber can only be used underwater as the internal gas pressure is directly proportional to the depth underwater and raising or lowering the chamber is the only way to adjust the pressure a sealable diving chamber closed bell or dry bell is a pressure vessel with hatches large enough for people to enter and exit and a compressed breathing gas supply to raise the internal air pressure such chambers provide a supply of oxygen for the user and are usually called hyperbaric chambers

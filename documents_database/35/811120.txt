atoms of different chemical elements are usually represented by spheres of different colors space filling calotte models are also referred to as cpk models after the chemists robert corey linus pauling and walter koltun who over a span of time developed the modeling concept into a useful form they are distinguished from other 3d representations such as the ball and stick and skeletal models by the use of the full size space filling spheres for the atoms they are useful for visualizing the effective shape and relative dimensions of the molecule and the shapes of surface a given static conformer might present on the other hand these models mask the chemical bonds between the atoms and make it difficult to see the structure of the molecule that is obscured by the atoms nearest to the viewer in a particular pose for this reason such models are of greater utility if they can be used dynamically especially when used with complex molecules e g see the greater understanding of the molecules shape given when the thc model is clicked on to rotate space filling models arise out of a desire to represent molecules in ways that reflect the electronic surfaces that

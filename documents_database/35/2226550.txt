in some cases this allows them to be solved exactly using the conformal bootstrap method notable two dimensional conformal field theories include minimal models liouville theory massless free bosonic theories wess zumino witten models and certain sigma models two dimensional conformal field theories cfts are defined on riemann surfaces where local conformal maps are holomorphic functions while a cft might conceivably exist only on a given riemann surface its existence on any surface other than the sphere implies its existence on all surfaces on the other hand some cfts exist only on the sphere unless stated otherwise we consider cft on the sphere in this article given a local complex coordinate formula 1 the real vector space of infinitesimal conformal maps has the basis formula 2 with formula 3 for example formula 4 and formula 5 generate translations relaxing the assumption that formula 6 is the complex conjugate of formula 1 i e complexifying the space of infinitesimal conformal maps one obtains a complex vector space with the basis formula 8 with their natural commutators the differential operators formula 9 generate a witt algebra by standard quantum mechanical arguments the symmetry algebra of conformal field theory must be the central

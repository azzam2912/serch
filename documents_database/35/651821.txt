a satellite placed in this orbit spends most of its time over a chosen area of the earth a phenomenon known as apogee dwell which makes them particularly well suited for communications satellites serving high latitude regions the ground track of a satellite in a tundra orbit is a closed figure 8 with a smaller loop over either the northern or southern hemisphere this differentiates them from molniya orbits designed to service high latitude regions which have the same inclination but half the period and do not loiter over a single region tundra and molniya orbits are used to provide high latitude users with higher elevation angles than a geostationary orbit this is desirable as broadcasting to these latitudes from a geostationary orbit above the earth s equator requires considerable power due to the low elevation angles and the extra distance and atmospheric attenuation that comes with it sites located above 81 latitude are unable to view geocentric satellites at all and as a rule of thumb elevation angles of less than 10 can cause problems depending on the communications frequency highly elliptical orbits provide an alternative to geostationary ones as they remain over their desired high latitude regions for

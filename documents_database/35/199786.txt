more formally if prov p means that the formula p is provable then or an immediate corollary of l b s theorem is that if p is not provable in pa then if p is provable in pa then p is true is not provable in pa for example if formula 3 is provable in pa then formula 3 is not provable in pa l b s theorem is named for martin hugo l b who formulated it in 1955 provability logic abstracts away from the details of encodings used in g del s incompleteness theorems by expressing the provability of formula 5 in the given system in the language of modal logic by means of the modality then we can formalize l b s theorem by the axiom known as axiom gl for g del l b this is sometimes formalised by means of an inference rule that infers from the provability logic gl that results from taking the modal logic k4 or k since the axiom schema 4 formula 9 then becomes redundant and adding the above axiom gl is the most intensely investigated system in provability logic l b s theorem can be proved within modal logic

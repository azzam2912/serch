they may be configured in a series parallel or a mixture of both to deliver the desired voltage capacity or power density the term battery pack is often used in reference to radio controlled hobby toys and battery electric vehicles components of battery packs include the individual batteries or cells and the interconnects which provide electrical conductivity between them rechargeable battery packs often contain a temperature sensor which the battery charger uses to detect the end of charging interconnects are also found in batteries as they are the part which connects each cell though batteries are most often only arranged in series strings when a pack contains groups of cells in parallel there are differing wiring configurations which take into consideration the electrical balance of the circuit battery regulators are sometimes used to keep the voltage of each individual cell below its maximum value during charging so as to allow the weaker batteries to become fully charged bringing the whole pack back into balance active balancing can also be performed by battery balancer devices which can shuttle energy from strong cells to weaker ones in real time for better balance a well balanced pack lasts longer and delivers better performance

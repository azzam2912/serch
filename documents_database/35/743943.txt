the circumscription of the group has varied widely a 2014 analysis resulted in about 20 families including salticidae jumping spiders thomisidae crab spiders and clubionidae spiders in this group have better senses sight hearing than others some even show courtship dances and songs the dionycha are now considered to be a subgroup of the larger rta clade most species hunt their prey instead of building webs there are no cribellate members in the dionycha today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw present in ancestral spiders evolved several times independently so this alone is not a criterion that defines the clade in 2014 mart n j ram rez published a major study of the phylogeny of dionycha he included the families listed below where means that the family may not be monophyletic or there is some other reason why its inclusion is not straightforward two subclades were found the omt clade marked by the possession of an oblique median tapetum and the ctc clade nested within the omt clade marked by a particular kind of claw tuft clasper

a gamma ray burst is a highly luminous flash associated with an explosion in a distant galaxy and producing gamma rays the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation and often followed by a longer lived afterglow emitted at longer wavelengths x ray ultraviolet optical infrared and radio at a total duration of only 3 seconds grb 070714b was classified as a short burst a subclass of grbs which is believed to be caused by the merger of two neutron stars grb 070714b had a redshift of z 0 92 corresponding to a distance of about 7 4 billion light years making it the most distant short burst detected as of 2007 grb 070714b was detected by the swift gamma ray burst mission satellite on 14 july 2007 at 04 59 utc the burst lasted only 3 seconds and reached its peak intensity 0 2 seconds after the initial detection the optical afterglow was detected by the liverpool telescope and the william herschel telescope spectroscopy of the optical afterglow and the burst s host galaxy revealed a single emission line of oxygen at a redshift of z 0 92 this corresponds to a distance of 7 4 billion light years making

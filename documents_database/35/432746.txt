arsenates are salts or esters of arsenic acid the arsenic atom in arsenate has a valency of 5 and is also known as pentavalent arsenic or as v arsenate resembles phosphate in many respects since arsenic and phosphorus occur in the same group column of the periodic table arsenates are moderate oxidizers with an electrode potential of 0 56 v for reduction to arsenites arsenates occur naturally in a variety of minerals those minerals may contain hydrated or anhydrous arsenates unlike phosphates arsenates are not lost from a mineral during weathering examples of arsenate containing minerals include adamite alarsite annabergite erythrite and legrandite where two arsenate ions are required to balance the charge in a formula it is called diarsenate for example trizinc diarsenate zn aso arsenate can replace inorganic phosphate in the step of glycolysis that produces 1 3 bisphosphoglycerate from glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate this yields 1 arseno 3 phosphoglycerate instead which is unstable and quickly hydrolyzes forming the next intermediate in the pathway 3 phosphoglycerate therefore glycolysis proceeds but the atp molecule that would be generated from 1 3 bisphosphoglycerate is lost arsenate is an uncoupler of glycolysis explaining its toxicity as with other arsenic compounds arsenite binds

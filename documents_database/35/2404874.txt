the p fimbriae is considered to be one of the most important virulence factor in uropathogenic e coli and plays an important role in upper urinary tract infections p fimbriae mediate adherence to host cells a key event in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections p fimbriae are large linear structures projecting from the surface of the bacterial cell with lengths of 1 2um the pili can be larger than the diameter of the bacteria itself the main body of the fimbriae is composed of approx 1000 copies of the major fimbrial subunit protein papa forming a helical rod the short fimbrial tip is made of the subunits papk pape papf and the tip adhesin papg which mediates the binding the fimbriae is assembled by a chaperone usher system and proteins required for the assembly are expressed by the pap operon which is located on pathogenicity islands the genes of the pap operon encode five structural proteins papa papk pape papf and papg four proteins involved in the transport and assembly papd paph papc papj and two proteins papb papi regulating the operon expression adherence to host uroepithelial cells is a crucial step during the infection that allows uropathogenic e

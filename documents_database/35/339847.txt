for example a regular user of example com may be lured to click a link where the latin character a is replaced with the cyrillic character this kind of spoofing attack is also known as script spoofing unicode incorporates numerous writing systems and for a number of reasons similar looking characters such as greek latin o and cyrillic were not assigned the same code their incorrect or malicious usage is a possibility for security attacks the registration of homographic domain names is akin to typosquatting in that both forms of attacks use a similar looking name to a more established domain to fool a user the major difference is that in typosquatting the perpetrator attracts victims by relying on natural human typographical errors of those manually entering a url while in homograph spoofing the perpetrator deceives the victims by presenting visually indistinguishable hyperlinks indeed it would be a rare accident for a web user to type e g a cyrillic letter within an otherwise english word such as citibank there are cases in which a registration can be both typosquatting and homograph spoofing the pairs of l i i j and 0 o are all both close together on keyboards

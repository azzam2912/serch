immunotherapy aims to utilize the body s own defense mechanism the immune system to recognize mutated cancer cells and to kill them the way the immune system would recognize and kill a virus antigen presenting cells are the sentinels of the immune system and patrol the body for pathogens when they encounter foreign pathogens the antigen presenting cells alert the t cells the soldiers of the immune system that there is something foreign in the body with specific cell surface molecules aapcs are synthetic versions of these sentinel cells and are made by attaching the specific t cell stimulating signals to various macro and micro biocompatible surfaces this can potentially reduce the cost while allowing control over generating large numbers of functional pathogen specific t cells for therapy activated and stimulated t cells can be studied in this biomimetic contex and used for adoptive transfer as an immunotherapy modeled after apcs aapcs need to have at least two signals to stimulate antigen specific t cells the first signal is the major histocompatibility complex mhc which in humans is also called the human leukocyte antigen hla this is the molecule which is loaded with the specific antigen mhc class i are

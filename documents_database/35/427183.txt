the jagdfaust was developed to address this problem a 5 cm shell was mounted in a launch tube held in place by a pair of thin pins four such tubes were mounted vertically to fire upward in each wing to ensure it would be fired at the correct time the weapon featured a simple form of automated trigger in which an optical photocell detected the dark silhouette of an allied bomber replacing bright blue sky and triggered the firing of the armed jagdfaust guns when the weapon fired the force of the launch would break the pins holding the tube in place and the heavy tube would be ejected downward to offset the momentum of the explosive force of the shell as a result the plane s flight was not affected the jagdfaust used a 5 cm minengranate shell whose thin walls traded fragmentation for additional explosives when detonated within an aircraft with sheet metal skin the skin would be blown off to devastating effect the entire weapon was designed for economy because it was intended for short range use the shell had an aerodynamically inefficient shape that could be easily forged or stamped its tolerances were loose as its

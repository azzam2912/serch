the group s exhibitions in copenhagen created wide international participation after the second world war the association was revived as linien ii with emphasis on concrete art in the 1930s art moved into a new phase with experiments in the theoretical and intellectual use of shapes and symbols while at the same time a symbolism emerged from the world of dreams this was the basis for concrete art and surrealism which became the latest trend in the international avant garde movement the association of abstraction and surrealism was pioneered by vilhelm bjerke petersen who in 1930 joined the bauhaus school in weimar a key avant garde institution which revolutionized not just painting but architecture sculpture literature theatre and dance bauhaus is remembered for its influence on abstract art and functionalist architecture and design at the bauhaus bjerke petersen had studied under wassily kandinsky and paul klee and was thus familiar with contemporary theories of abstract art this led to the publication in 1933 of symboler i abstrakt kunst symbols in abstract art which served as a manifesto for the movement in denmark in 1934 together with ejler bille and richard mortensen petersen founded linien which covered both abstraction and symbolism

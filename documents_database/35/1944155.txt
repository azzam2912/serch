from the viewpoint of mechanics elastocapillarity phenomena essentially involve competition between the elastic strain energy in the bulk and the energy on the surfaces interfaces in the modeling of these phenomena some challenging issues are among others the exact characterization of energies at the micro scale the solution of strongly nonlinear problems of structures with large deformation and moving boundary conditions and instability of either solid structures or droplets films the capillary forces are generally negligible in the analysis of macroscopic structures but often play a significant role in many phenomena at small scales when depositing a droplet on a solid surface with contact angle horizontal force balance was described by young s equation however there is a vertical force balance which often ignored can be written as f sin e where f is the force perunit length in the vertical direction is the surface tension of a liquid e is the young s modulus of a substrate is deformation of the substrate this gives length scale e sin for the deformation of bulk materials caused by the surface tension force for example if a water 72 mn m droplet is deposited on the glass e 700 gpa this gives

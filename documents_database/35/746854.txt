it presents as a white solid and may be tinted grey with decreasing particle size and impurity levels depending upon synthesis conditions the surface of the alane may be passivated with a thin layer of aluminum oxide and or hydroxide alane and its derivatives are used as reducing agents in organic synthesis alane is a polymer hence its formula is sometimes represented with the formula alh alane forms numerous polymorphs which are named alane alane alane alane alane alane and alane alane has a cubic or rhombohedral morphology whereas alane forms needle like crystals and alane forms a bundle of fused needles alane is soluble in thf and ether the rate of the precipitation of solid alane from ether varies with the preparation method the crystal structure of alane has been determined and features aluminium atoms surrounded by 6 hydrogen atoms that bridge to 6 other aluminium atoms the al h distances are all equivalent 172pm and the al h al angle is 141 alane is the most thermally stable polymorph alane and alane are produced together and convert to alane upon heating and alane are produced in still other crystallization conditions although they are less thermally stable and polymorphs

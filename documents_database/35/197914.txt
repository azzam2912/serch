an image or shape can be drawn in the high resolution graphics mode with scaling and rotation via software routines in the rom shape tables were supported via applesoft basic and from machine code in the programmer s aid package that was bundled with the original integer basic roms for that computer applesoft s high resolution graphics routines were not optimized for speed so shape tables were not typically used for performance critical software such as games which were typically written in assembly language and used pre shifted bitmap shapes shape tables were used primarily for static shapes and sometimes for fancy text beagle bros offered a number of fonts in font mechanic as applesoft shape tables the vectors of a two dimensional graphic each encoding a direction from the previous pixel along with a flag indicating whether the new pixel should be illuminated or not were encoded up to three in a byte these were stored in a table via the monitor or the codice 1 command from there the graphic could be referenced by number a table could contain up to 255 shapes and built in applesoft routines permitted scaling rotating and drawing or erasing the shape an

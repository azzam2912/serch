for this reason and as a matter of convenience a subjective rating of the interfering effect of the noise using the term circuit merit is commonly used in place of metered measurements this method uses a scale of five steps to describe performance these are listed and defined in the above table the speech to noise ratios in db included in this table are arbitrary numbers which apply if both speech and noise are measured on either a 2b noise measuring set with f1a line weighting or a 3a noise measuring set with c message weighting in making such measurements noise is measured in the normal manner and speech volume is read by the method used with a vu meter circuit merit 3 is generally regarded as the minimum acceptable for public mobile telephone service and is used as a basis for drawing coverage boundaries where necessary cm2 may be found tolerable for occasional calls but this grade of transmission is clearly unsuitable as a service offering in typical service areas so defined users will experience transmission as poor as cm3 only when the mobile station is situated near the fringes of the area they will enjoy better transmission throughout

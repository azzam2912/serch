the two independent theories address the physical phenomena of light and matter in 1905 einstein argued that the requirement of consistency between thermodynamics and electromagnetism leads to the conclusion that light is quantized obtaining the relation formula 1 this paper is the dawn of quantum theory in a few decades quantum theory became established with an independent set of rules currently quantum thermodynamics addresses the emergence of thermodynamic laws from quantum mechanics it differs from quantum statistical mechanics in the emphasis on dynamical processes out of equilibrium in addition there is a quest for the theory to be relevant for a single individual quantum system there is an intimate connection of quantum thermodynamics with the theory of open quantum systems quantum mechanics inserts dynamics into thermodynamics giving a sound foundation to finite time thermodynamics the main assumption is that the entire world is a large closed system and therefore time evolution is governed by a unitary transformation generated by a global hamiltonian for the combined system bath scenario the global hamiltonian can be decomposed into where formula 3 is the system hamiltonian formula 4 is the bath hamiltonian and formula 5 is the system bath interaction the state of the

it is the foundation of most other branches of topology including differential topology geometric topology and algebraic topology another name for general topology is point set topology the fundamental concepts in point set topology are continuity compactness and connectedness the words nearby arbitrarily small and far apart can all be made precise by using the concept of open sets if we change the definition of open set we change what continuous functions compact sets and connected sets are each choice of definition for open set is called a topology a set with a topology is called a topological space metric spaces are an important class of topological spaces where a real non negative distance also called a metric can be defined on pairs of points in the set having a metric simplifies many proofs and many of the most common topological spaces are metric spaces general topology grew out of a number of areas most importantly the following general topology assumed its present form around 1940 it captures one might say almost everything in the intuition of continuity in a technically adequate form that can be applied in any area of mathematics let x be a set and let be

it is installed at the atlas facility at argonne national laboratory the helios concept was first proposed at the workshop on experimental equipment for an advanced isol facility at lawrence berkeley national laboratory in 1998 the concept was introduced as a next generation large acceptance spectrometer for measuring heavy ion reactions schematically helios is based around a large bore superconducting solenoid accelerated heavy ion beams enter the solenoid along the magnetic axis passing through a hollow detector array the beam then intercepts a light ion target also on the magnetic axis in the configuration shown in the figure charged reaction products ejected rearward in the laboratory frame move in helical orbits to the detector array heavy beam like recoils are kinematically focused forward in a narrow cone and intercepted by the so called recoil detector array the helios collaboration was formed with members from argonne national laboratory western michigan university and manchester university to construct characterize and commission the helios spectrometer the construction of the spectrometer began with the delivery of the superconducting solenoid upon which helios is based the solenoid was delivered to argonne on december 8 2006 over the next 20 months the solenoid was transformed into a

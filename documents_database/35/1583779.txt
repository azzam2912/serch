vertices of the truncation 8 simplex are located as pairs on the edge of the 8 simplex vertices of the bitruncated 8 simplex are located on the triangular faces of the 8 simplex vertices of the tritruncated 8 simplex are located inside the tetrahedral cells of the 8 simplex the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the truncated 8 simplex can be most simply positioned in 9 space as permutations of 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 this construction is based on facets of the truncated 9 orthoplex the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the bitruncated 8 simplex can be most simply positioned in 9 space as permutations of 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 this construction is based on facets of the bitruncated 9 orthoplex the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the tritruncated 8 simplex can be most simply positioned in 9 space as permutations of 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 this construction is based on facets of the tritruncated 9 orthoplex the quadritruncated 8 simplex an isotopic polytope constructed from 18 tritruncated 7 simplex facets the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the quadritruncated 8 simplex

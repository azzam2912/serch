a serrated cutting edge has many small points of contact with the material being cut by having less contact area than a smooth blade or other edge the applied pressure at each point of contact is greater and the points of contact are at a sharper angle to the material being cut this causes a cutting action that involves many small splits in the surface of the material being cut which cumulatively serve to cut the material along the line of the blade in nature serration is commonly seen in the cutting edge on the teeth of some species usually sharks however it also appears on non cutting surfaces for example in botany where a toothed leaf margin or other plant part such as the edge of a carnation petal is described as being serrated a serrated leaf edge may reduce the force of wind and other natural elements probably the largest serrations on earth occur on the skylines of mountains the spanish word sierra as in sierra nevada means a saw these occur both due to the uneven action of landform edges pushing rock upwards and the uneven action of erosion human uses of serration have copied and gone

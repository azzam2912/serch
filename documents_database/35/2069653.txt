metallo intercalators insert themselves between two intact base pairs without expelling or replacing the original nitrogenous bases the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases at the site of intercalation remain unbroken in addition to stacking between the aromatic regions of the intercalator and the nitrogenous bases of dna intercalation is stabilized by van der waals hydrophobic electrostatic and entropic interactions this ability to bind to specific dna base pairs allows for potential therapeutic applications of metallo intercalators in the case of ruthenium intercalators the general synthesis consists of preparing intercalative ligands followed by their coupling to a ruthenium metal complex coordinated by specific ancillary ligands examples of prior ruthenium complexes used as precursors for metallo intercalators include cis ru bpy cl and cis ru phen cl 2ho which can be synthesized into ru bpy maip ru bpy paip ru bpy bfiph clo and ru phen bfiph clo metallo intercalators stack with unbroken dna base pairs after entering via a groove typically the minor in contrast to metallo insertors which replace expelled base pairs after entering double stranded dna via the minor groove intercalation of a metallo intercalator creates less strain in the dna duplex than insertion metallo insertors induce an

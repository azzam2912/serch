it has applications in a wide range of disciplines including mechanical civil chemical and biomedical engineering geophysics oceanography meteorology astrophysics and biology it can be divided into fluid statics the study of fluids at rest and fluid dynamics the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion it is a branch of continuum mechanics a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms that is it models matter from a macroscopic viewpoint rather than from microscopic fluid mechanics especially fluid dynamics is an active field of research typically mathematically complex many problems are partly or wholly unsolved and are best addressed by numerical methods typically using computers a modern discipline called computational fluid dynamics cfd is devoted to this approach particle image velocimetry an experimental method for visualizing and analyzing fluid flow also takes advantage of the highly visual nature of fluid flow the study of fluid mechanics goes back at least to the days of ancient greece when archimedes investigated fluid statics and buoyancy and formulated his famous law known now as the archimedes principle which was published in his work on floating bodies generally considered to be the first major

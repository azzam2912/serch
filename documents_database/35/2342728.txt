it had an estimated magnitude of 7 7 and a maximum felt intensity of ix on the mercalli intensity scale the city of tabriz was almost completely destroyed approximately 50 000 people were killed tabriz lies within the complex zone of collision between the arabian plate and the eurasian plate the main structures accommodating this oblique collision are west east trending thrust faults and wnw ese trending dextral right lateral strike slip faults the north tabriz fault is an active 150 km long dextral strike slip fault that passes close to the northern edge of tabriz city it has two main segments and an estimated overall slip rate of about 7 mm per year the southeastern segment is interpreted to have ruptured in the 1721 tabriz earthquake while the northwestern segment ruptured during the 1780 earthquake both events produced associated ground rupture which is still observable an average slip of about 4 m has been estimated for earthquakes along the northwestern segment a recurrence interval of about 800 years has been estimated suggesting that a major earthquake along this structure is unlikely in the next few centuries although a recurrence interval of 250 300 years has also been proposed indicating

it is of higher quality than lignite coal but of poorer quality than anthracite formation is usually the result of high pressure being exerted on lignite its coloration can be black or sometimes dark brown often there are well defined bands of bright and dull material within the seams these distinctive sequences which are classified according to either dull bright banded or bright dull banded is how bituminous coals are stratigraphically identified bituminous coal is an organic sedimentary rock formed by diagenetic and sub metamorphic compression of peat bog material its primary constituents are macerals vitrinite and liptinite the carbon content of bituminous coal is around 60 80 the rest is composed of water air hydrogen and sulfur which have not been driven off from the macerals bank density is approximately 1346 kg m 84 lb ft bulk density typically runs to 833 kg m 52 lb ft the heat content of bituminous coal ranges from 24 to 35 mj kg 21 million to 30 million btu per short ton on a moist mineral matter free basis within the coal mining industry this type of coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp a dangerous mixture of gases

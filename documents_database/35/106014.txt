the theorem is that gaussian curvature can be determined entirely by measuring angles distances and their rates on a surface without reference to the particular manner in which the surface is embedded in the ambient 3 dimensional euclidean space in other words the gaussian curvature of a surface does not change if one bends the surface without stretching it thus the gaussian curvature is an intrinsic invariant of a surface gauss presented the theorem in this manner translated from latin the theorem is remarkable because the starting definition of gaussian curvature makes direct use of position of the surface in space so it is quite surprising that the result does not depend on its embedding in spite of all bending and twisting deformations undergone in modern mathematical terminology the theorem may be stated as follows a sphere of radius r has constant gaussian curvature which is equal to 1 r at the same time a plane has zero gaussian curvature as a corollary of theorema egregium a piece of paper cannot be bent onto a sphere without crumpling conversely the surface of a sphere cannot be unfolded onto a flat plane without distorting the distances if one were to step

they are usually triggered by the discharges of positive lightning between an underlying thundercloud and the ground sprites appear as luminous reddish orange flashes they often occur in clusters above the troposphere at an altitude range of sporadic visual reports of sprites go back at least to 1886 but they were first photographed on july 6 1989 by scientists from the university of minnesota and have subsequently been captured in video recordings many thousands of times sprites are sometimes inaccurately called upper atmospheric lightning however sprites are cold plasma phenomena that lack the hot channel temperatures of tropospheric lightning so they are more akin to fluorescent tube discharges than to lightning discharges sprites are associated with various other upper atmospheric optical phenomena including blue jets and elves the earliest known report of transient optical phenomena above thunderclouds is from johann georg estor in 1730 another early report is by toynbee and mackenzie in 1886 nobel laureate c t r wilson had suggested in 1925 on theoretical grounds that electrical breakdown could occur in the upper atmosphere and in 1956 he witnessed what possibly could have been a sprite they were first documented photographically on july 6 1989 when scientists from

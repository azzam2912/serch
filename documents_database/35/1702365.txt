local hormones are activated and inactivated quickly they are released during physical work and exercise they mainly control smooth and vascular muscle dilation strength of response is dependent upon the concentration of receptors of target cell and the amount of ligand the specific local hormone eicosanoids k s noydz eicosa twenty eidos formed are a primary type of local hormone these local hormones are formed by a chain of 20 amino acids and fatty acids from phospholipids in the cell membrane eicosanoids initiate either autocrine stimulation or paracrine stimulation there are two main types of eicosanoids prostaglandins and leukotrienes which initiate either autocrine stimulationor paracrine stimulation ecosanoids are the result of a ubiquitous pathway which first produces arachidonic acid and then the ecosanoid product prostaglandins are the most diverse category of eicosanoids and are thought to be synthesized in most tissues of the body this type of local hormone stimulates pain receptorsand increases the inflammatory response nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs stop the formation of prostaglandins thus inhibiting these responses leukotrienes are a type of ecosanoids that are produced in leukocytes and function in inflammatory mediation paracrines para beside or near are local hormones that act on neighboring cells this type

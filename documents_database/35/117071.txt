this behavior is codified in heisenberg s energy time uncertainty principle still the exact effect of such fleeting bits of energy is difficult to quantify the vacuum energy is a special case of zero point energy that relates to the quantum vacuum the effects of vacuum energy can be experimentally observed in various phenomena such as spontaneous emission the casimir effect and the lamb shift and are thought to influence the behavior of the universe on cosmological scales using the upper limit of the cosmological constant the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be 10 joules 10 ergs per cubic meter however in both quantum electrodynamics qed and stochastic electrodynamics sed consistency with the principle of lorentz covariance and with the magnitude of the planck constant suggest a much larger value of 10 joules per cubic meter this huge discrepancy is known as the cosmological constant problem quantum field theory states that all fundamental fields such as the electromagnetic field must be quantized at each and every point in space a field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs and the strength of the field is like the

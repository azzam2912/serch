the disease has two forms familial lcat deficiency in which there is complete lcat deficiency and fish eye disease in which there is a partial deficiency lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase catalyzes the formation of cholesterol esters in lipoproteins symptoms of the familial form include visual impairment caused by diffuse corneal opacities target cell hemolytic anemia and renal failure less common symptoms include atherosclerosis hepatomegaly enlarged liver splenomegaly enlarged spleen and lymphadenopathy fish eye disease is less severe and most commonly presents with impaired vision due to corneal opacification it rarely presents with other findings although atherosclerosis hepatomegaly splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy can occur carlson and philipson found that the disease was named so because the cornea of the eye was so opaque or cloudy with dots of cholesterol that it resembled a boiled fish if an individual only carry one copy of the mutated gene they typically do not show symptoms a deficiency of lcat causes accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in certain body tissues cholesterol effluxes from cells as free cholesterol and is transported in hdl as esterified cholesterol lcat is the enzyme that esterifies the free cholesterol on hdl to cholesterol ester and allows the maturation of hdl lcat deficiency does

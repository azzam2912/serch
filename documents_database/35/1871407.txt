fam46b contains one protein domain of unknown function duf1693 yeast two hybrid screening has identified three proteins that physically interact with fam46b these are atx1 pepp2 encoded by rhoxf2 and dazap2 fam46b is the most common name used for the gene encoding fam46b the aliases mgc16491 and rp11 344h11 have also been used to describe the same gene fam46b a 7 283 base pair gene located on the antisense strand of dna on the short arm of chromosome 1 at the specific locus 1p36 11 because it is on the antisense strand the direction fam46b is transcribed in is opposite to the standard numbering of nucleotides along the chromosome fam46b starts at base 27 339 333 and ends at 27 331 522 the el dorado program through genomatix predicts the promoter region to be 1028 bases long spanning bases 27 339 962 to 27 338 935 the fam46b gene contains two exons both of which are found in fam46b protein there is one main protein isoform indicating no alternative splicing of fam46b mrna fam46b has three paralogs in homo sapiens fam46a fam46c and fam46d multiple sequence alignments of the four members of the fam46 show high levels of conservataion particularly

stim1 is an er resident calcium sensor protein responsible for sensing calcium changes in internal calcium stores and communicate with orai calcium channels in the plasma membrane the cytoplasmic region of limeter contains a flexible linker and a genetically encoded lightswitch lov2 domain light oxygen voltage sensing domain residues 404 546 derived from avena sativa phototropin 1 followed by a c terminal pm targeting polybasic tail that associates with negative charged phosphoinositides in the inner half of the leaflet of plasma membrane in the dark the j helix docks to the lov2 domain and cages the polybasic tail to prevent its interaction with negatively charged pm resident phosphoinositides following blue light illumination photoexcitation generates a covalent adduct between a cysteine residue and the flavin cofactor in lov2 and subsequently promotes the undocking and unwinding of the j helix thereby exposing the polybasic c tail to enable translocation of the protein towards pm to form puncta like structures as a result limeter undergoes photo inducible translocation toward er pm junctions to specifically label cer a video showing this process can be found here this process can be reversibly repeated with multiple light dark cycles without significant loss in the magnitude of

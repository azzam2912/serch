this is not the miqat so it is not compulsory to wear ihram here this mosque is also known as masjid e ayesha since muhammad s wife ayesha had put her ihram restriction on pilgrimage from this place once this was allowed by the prophet as a special case when ayesha could not complete her umra on account of being in an impure state due to menstrual period ayesha s brother who accompanied her to taneem and back did not perform another umra along with his sister understanding that it was a special allowance made for ayesha or any woman who happens to becoming impure due to her menstrual period nowadays it is the nearest and most convenient location to enter into ihram for those residing within the boundaries of the haram this is quite a big mosque with facilities for baths ablution and changing available for pilgrims and those who come to offer regular prayers

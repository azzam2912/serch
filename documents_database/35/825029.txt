the human body can be viewed as a heat engine where food is the input energy the human body will generate excess heat into the environment so the body can continue to operate the heat transfer is proportional to temperature difference in cold environments the body loses more heat to the environment and in hot environments the body does not exert enough heat both the hot and cold scenarios lead to discomfort maintaining this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures is one of the important goals of hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning design engineers most people will feel comfortable at room temperature colloquially a range of temperatures around but this may vary greatly between individuals and depending on factors such as activity level clothing and humidity thermal neutrality is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings the main factors that influence thermal comfort are those that determine heat gain and loss namely metabolic rate clothing insulation air temperature mean radiant temperature air speed and relative humidity psychological parameters such as individual expectations also affect thermal comfort the predicted mean vote pmv model

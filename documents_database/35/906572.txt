one day a young corky carroll came into the katin s shop complaining of the difficulty in finding a pair of swim shorts durable enough to stand up to the then new pastime of surfboard riding walter used his sewing machine and some of the sturdy boat canvas previously used for boat covers and created the first pair of kanvas by katin surf trunks the katins kept making their surf trunks selling them from the surfside store and through a hemisphere wide network of surf shop dealers from the 1960s through the 1970s many top surfers were loyal customers and appeared in surf magazine ads wearing them walter katin died in 1967 and nancy continued to run the shop and the business in the same manner as before in 1977 just as professional surfing was starting to take off nancy katin initiated an annual pro am team challenge at the huntington beach pier with many of the world s best surfers coming to compete winning the katin team challenge became a prestigious accomplishment in the surfing world by the late 1970s the surf industry had begun a decade of explosive growth but katin continued to run the business as before

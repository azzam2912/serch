when a unicast packet arrives at a host ip must determine whether the packet is locally destined its destination matches an address that is assigned to an interface of the host if the ip stack is implemented with a weak host model it accepts any locally destined packet regardless of the network interface on which the packet was received if the ip stack is implemented with a strong host model it only accepts locally destined packets if the destination ip address in the packet matches an ip address assigned to the network interface on which the packet was received the weak host model provides better network connectivity for example it can be easy to find any packet arriving at the host using ordinary tools but it also makes hosts susceptible to multihome based network attacks the strong host model provides better security the ipv4 implementation in microsoft windows versions prior to windows vista uses the weak host model the windows vista and windows server 2008 tcp ip stack supports the strong host model for both ipv4 and ipv6 and is configured to use it by default however it can also be configured to use a weak host model the ipv4

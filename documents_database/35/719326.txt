he was associate professor and professor of biology at brown university from 1969 to 1972 and professor of population genetics at the center for demographic and population genetics university of texas at houston from 1972 to 1990 he is a theoretical population geneticist and evolutionary biologist acting alone or working with his students he has continuously developed statistical theories of molecular evolution taking into account discoveries in molecular biology he has also developed concepts in evolutionary theory and advanced the theory of mutation driven evolution he is the first to show mathematically that in the presence of gene interaction natural selection always tends to enhance the linkage intensity between genetic loci or maintain the same linkage relationship he then observed that the average recombination value per genome is generally lower in higher organisms than in lower organisms and attributed this observation to his theory of linkage modification recent molecular data indicate that many sets of interacting genes such as hox genes immunoglobulin genes and histone genes have often existed as gene clusters for a long evolutionary time this observation can also be explained by his theory of linkage modification he also showed that unlike r a fisher s argument deleterious

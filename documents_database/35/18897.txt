a battery is a prime example of dc power direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire but can also flow through semiconductors insulators or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams the electric current flows in a constant direction distinguishing it from alternating current ac a term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current the abbreviations ac and dc are often used to mean simply alternating and direct as when they modify current or voltage direct current may be converted from an alternating current supply by use of a rectifier which contains electronic elements usually or electromechanical elements historically that allow current to flow only in one direction direct current may be converted into alternating current via an inverter direct current has many uses from the charging of batteries to large power supplies for electronic systems motors and more very large quantities of direct current power are used in production of aluminum and other electrochemical processes it is also used for some railways especially in urban areas high voltage direct current is used to transmit large amounts of power from remote generation sites or to interconnect alternating current power grids

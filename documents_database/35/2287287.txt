in addition whereas all androgen and estrogen esters are prodrugs of the parent compound only some and not all progestogen esters act as prodrugs esters of 17 hydroxyprogesterone and 19 norprogesterone derivatives like hydroxyprogesterone caproate medroxyprogesterone acetate and nomegestrol acetate are active themselves and are not prodrugs whereas esters of 19 nortestosterone derivatives like norethisterone acetate and norethisterone enanthate are not active themselves and are prodrugs the following major progestogen esters have been marketed and the following minor progestogen esters have been marketed the following veterinary only progestogen esters have also been marketed the corticosteroid ester mometasone furoate asmanex elocom elocon elosalic nasonex which is a 17 hydroxyprogesterone derivative also has very potent progestogenic activity though it is not used as a progestogen and is instead used exclusively as a corticosteroid the following progestogen esters have been marketed and the following veterinary only progestogen esters have also been marketed the following progestogen esters have been marketed many 19 nortestosterone androgen esters such as nandrolone esters like nandrolone decanoate deca durabolin and nandrolone phenpropionate durabolin also have potent progestogenic activity although not esters the following progestogen ethers have been marketed although not esters the following progestogen cyclic ketals cyclic acetals have

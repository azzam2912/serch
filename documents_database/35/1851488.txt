core frequency ranges from 40 to 100 mhz embedded flash from 32 kb to 1 6 mb ram up to 138 kb the microcontroller containing an embedded voltage regulator can run from a single power supply between 3 and 5 v the central processing unit cpu of the xc2000 microcontroller family is principally fetching and decoding instructions to supply perform operations and store calculated result on the operands for the arithmetic logic unit alu and the mac unit as the cpu is the main engine of the xc2000 microcontroller it is also affected by certain actions of the peripheral subsystem because a five stage processing pipeline plus two stage fetch pipeline is implemented in the xc2000 up to five instructions can be processed in parallel most instructions of the xc2000 are executed in one single clock cycle due to this parallelism there are easy kits for evaluation of the controller features and application kits as quick start for specific applications available main applications are in the industrial field like electric motor control automation and solar inverters

these technologies can be used to create virtual objects in a computer simulation to control virtual objects and to enhance remote control of machines and devices telerobotics haptic devices may incorporate tactile sensors that measure forces exerted by the user on the interface the word haptic from the haptikos means pertaining to the sense of touch simple haptic devices are common in the form of game controllers joysticks and steering wheels haptic technology facilitates investigation of how the human sense of touch works by allowing the creation of controlled haptic virtual objects most researchers distinguish three sensory systems related to sense of touch in humans cutaneous kinaesthetic and haptic all perceptions mediated by cutaneous and kinaesthetic sensibility are referred to as tactual perception the sense of touch may be classified as passive and active and the term haptic is often associated with active touch to communicate or recognize objects one of the earliest applications of haptic technology was in large aircraft that use servomechanism systems to operate control surfaces in lighter aircraft without servo systems as the aircraft approached a stall the aerodynamic buffeting vibrations was felt in the pilot s controls this was a useful warning of a dangerous

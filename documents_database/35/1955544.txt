it had a proprietary code base until 2015 but is now released as open source software versions are available for linux os x and windows and can come in cpu based or gpu based variants examples of hashcat supported hashing algorithms are microsoft lm hashes md4 md5 sha family unix crypt formats mysql and cisco pix hashcat has made its way into the news many times for the optimizations and flaws discovered by its creator which were exploited in subsequent hashcat releases for example the flaw in 1password s password manager hashing scheme previously hashcat used to come in two main variants with the release of hashcat v3 00 the gpu and cpu tools were merged into a single tool called hashcat the cpu only version became hashcat legacy both cpu and gpu now require opencl many of the algorithms supported by hashcat legacy such as md5 sha1 and others can be cracked in a shorter time using well documented gpu acceleration leveraged in gpu based hashcat however not all algorithms can be accelerated by leveraging gpus bcrypt is a good example of this due to factors such as data dependent branching serialization and memory to name just a few

the inhibitions in catalytic performance are accounted by different factors such as physical losses steam high temperature time coke formation and poisoning from metal contaminants in feedstock this type of deactivated catalyst is referred to as used or spent catalyst or equilibrium catalyst or simply ecat in fcc processes the equilibrium catalyst is a physical mixture of varying proportions of fresh catalyst and regenerated catalyst or aged catalyst circulating within the fcc column the equilibrium catalyst withdrawn as catalytically less active is spent catalyst and gets replaced with an equivalent amount of fresh catalyst spent fcc catalysts have low flammability and toxicity as compared to spent hydroprocessing catalysts however are not of benign nature and there is a risk of leaching of its components whereas in hydroprocessing the equilibrium catalyst or spent catalyst is entirely replaced with fresh catalyst upon loss in catalyst activity the disposal of spent catalyst is gaining importance particularly because of strict environmental regulations and high prices of fresh catalyst landfills and approved dumping sites have been predominantly used to get rid of the spent catalyst catalysts containing metals nickel vanadium molybdenum classified as hazardous are pre treated before disposal sale of spent catalyst to the

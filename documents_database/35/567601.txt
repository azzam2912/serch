more precisely it is the simultaneous acquisition of spatially coregistered images in many spectrally contiguous bands some spectral images contain only a few image planes of a spectral data cube while others are better thought of as full spectra at every location in the image for example solar physicists use the spectroheliograph to make images of the sun built up by scanning the slit of a spectrograph to study the behavior of surface features on the sun such a spectroheliogram may have a spectral resolution of over 100 000 formula 1 and be used to measure local motion via the doppler shift and even the magnetic field via the zeeman splitting or hanle effect at each location in the image plane the multispectral images collected by the opportunity rover in contrast have only four wavelength bands and hence are only a little more than 3 color images to be scientifically useful such measurement should be done using an internationally recognized system of units one application is spectral geophysical imaging which allows quantitative and qualitative characterization of the surface and of the atmosphere using radiometric measurements these measurements can then be used for unambiguous direct and indirect identification of surface materials

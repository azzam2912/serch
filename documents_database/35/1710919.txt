it was made largely by sports enthusiasts and amateur filmmakers in mid 1925 it is considered a lost film a man plays to enter a yacht race but is injured in a car accident his girlfriend takes his place and wins the race the film only received a limited release and was poorly reviewed by the critic from the sydney morning herald who stated it is not a film which will add much to the prestige of australian productions one looks at it in vain for those little touches which distinguish art from mere day labour the scenes have a naive unpremeditated air as though mr marinato had planted his camera firmly on the desired spot then shouted to his actors come along now do so and so and immediately begun to turn the handle in some of the scenes he himself appears bearing an amiable if somewhat sheepish profile the actors used no make up consequently their faces are often mere dark sillhouterrs there are some effective views of yachting on the harbour such as one sees from week to week in the tropical gaieties the story is so slight as to be hardly worth mentioning

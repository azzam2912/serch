it is also known as seifert weber dodecahedral space and hyperbolic dodecahedral space it is one of the first discovered examples of closed hyperbolic 3 manifolds it is constructed by gluing each face of a dodecahedron to its opposite in a way that produces a closed 3 manifold there are three ways to do this gluing consistently opposite faces are misaligned by 1 10 of a turn so to match them they must be rotated by 1 10 3 10 or 5 10 turn a rotation of 3 10 gives the seifert weber space rotation of 1 10 gives the poincar homology sphere and rotation by 5 10 gives 3 dimensional real projective space with the 3 10 turn gluing pattern the edges of the original dodecahedron are glued to each other in groups of five thus in the seifert weber space each edge is surrounded by five pentagonal faces and the dihedral angle between these pentagons is 72 this does not match the 117 dihedral angle of a regular dodecahedron in euclidean space but in hyperbolic space there exist regular dodecahedra with any dihedral angle between 60 and 117 and the hyperbolic dodecahedron with dihedral angle 72 may be

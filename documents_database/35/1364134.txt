it is divided into a preprocessing stage and a postprocessing stage in the preprocessing stage the linear system is partitioned into a block tridiagonal form assume for the time being that the diagonal blocks with are nonsingular define a block diagonal matrix then is also nonsingular left multiplying to both sides of the system gives which is to be solved in the postprocessing stage left multiplication by is equivalent to solving formula 7 systems of the form omitting and for formula 8 and and for formula 9 which can be carried out in parallel due to the banded nature of only a few leftmost columns of each and a few rightmost columns of each can be nonzero these columns are called the spikes without loss of generality assume that each spike contains exactly formula 10 columns formula 10 is much less than formula 2 pad the spike with columns of zeroes if necessary partition the spikes in all and into where and are of dimensions formula 15 partition similarly all and into notice that the system produced by the preprocessing stage can be reduced to a block pentadiagonal system of much smaller size recall that formula 10 is much less

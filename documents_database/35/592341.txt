it allows blood to drain from the lateral aspects of anterior cerebral hemispheres to the confluence of sinuses cerebrospinal fluid drains through arachnoid granulations into the superior sagittal sinus and is returned to venous circulation commencing at the foramen cecum through which it receives emissary veins from the nasal cavity it runs from anterior to posterior grooving the inner surface of the frontal the adjacent margins of the two parietal lobes and the superior division of the cruciate eminence of the occipital lobe near the internal occipital protuberance it drains into the confluence of sinuses and deviates to either side usually the right at this point it is continued as the corresponding transverse sinus the superior sagittal sinus is usually divided into three parts anterior foramen cecum to bregma middle bregma to lambda posterior lambda to confluence it is triangular in section narrow in front and gradually increases in size as it passes backward its inner surface presents the openings of the superior cerebral veins which run for the most part obliquely forward and open chiefly at the back part of the sinus their orifices being concealed by fibrous folds numerous fibrous bands chordae willisii extend transversely across the inferior

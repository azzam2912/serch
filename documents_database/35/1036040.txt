he initiated the development of superstring theory ramond completed his bsee from newark college of engineering now new jersey institute of technology in 1965 and completed his ph d in physics from syracuse university in 1969 he was a postdoctoral fellow at nal fermilab from 1969 to 1971 he became instructor at yale university from 1971 to 1973 and assistant professor at yale university from 1973 to 1976 he moved to caltech as an r a millikan senior fellow in 1976 he became a professor of physics at university of florida in 1980 and promoted to his present title of distinguished professor in 1999 ramond initiated the development of superstring theory in 1970 ramond generalized dirac s work for point like particles to stringlike ones in this process he discovered two dimensional supersymmetry and laid the ground for supersymmetry in four spacetime dimensions he found the spectrum of fermionic modes in string theory and the paper started superstring theory from this paper andr neveu and john schwarz developed a string theory with both fermions and bosons according to quantum mechanics particles can be divided into two types bosons and fermions the distinction between bosons and fermions is basic fermions are

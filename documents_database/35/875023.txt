this is useful as it allows decisions about the integrity of the data to be made in the application layer application or the codec where the significance of the bits is understood udp lite is described in rfc 3828 udp lite is based on user datagram protocol udp but unlike udp where either all or none of a packet is protected by a checksum udp lite allows for partial checksums that only covers part of a datagram an arbitrary count of octets at the beginning of the packet and will therefore deliver packets that have been partially corrupted it is designed for multimedia protocols such as voice over ip voip or streamed video in which receiving a packet with a damaged payload is better than receiving no packet at all for conventional udp and transmission control protocol tcp a single bit in error will cause a bad checksum meaning that the whole packet must be discarded in this way bit errors are promoted to entire packet errors even where the damage to the data is trivial for computing the checksum udp lite uses the same checksum algorithm used for udp and tcp modern multimedia codecs like g 718 and adaptive

large fragments of one male and one female skull and a molar tooth of h e nankinensis were discovered in 1993 in the hulu cave on the tangshan hills near nanjing the former capital city of china the term nanjing man is used to describe the subspecies of homo erectus but is also used when referring to the three fossils the specimens were found in the hulu limestone cave at a depth of 60 97 cm by liu luhong a local worker dating the fossils yielded an estimated age of 580 000 to 620 000 years old for the dating of fossils the carbon 14 method is often used but this method is not applicable for fossils older than 60 000 years which is the case for the nanjing man researchers used mass spectrometric u series dating to identify the age of the skulls best estimates date the skull to be at least 580 000 years old this research done in 2001 estimates the age of the skulls to be 270 000 years older than previous estimates executed with the use of different dating methods like electron spin resonance dating and alpha counting u series however by using mass spectrometric

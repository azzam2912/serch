since 2001 the variant commonly in use is the category 5e specification cat 5e the cable standard provides performance of up to 100 mhz and is suitable for most varieties of ethernet over twisted pair up to gigabit ethernet cat 5 is also used to carry other signals such as telephony and video this cable is commonly connected using punch down blocks and modular connectors most category 5 cables are unshielded relying on the balanced line twisted pair design and differential signaling for noise rejection the specification for category 5 cable was defined in ansi tia eia 568 a with clarification in tsb 95 these documents specify performance characteristics and test requirements for frequencies up to 100 mhz the cable is available in both stranded and solid conductor forms the stranded form is more flexible and withstands more bending without breaking patch cables are stranded permanent wiring used in structured cabling is solid core the category and type of cable can be identified by the printing on the jacket cable types connector types and cabling topologies are defined by tia eia 568 b nearly always 8p8c modular connectors often referred to incorrectly as rj45 connectors are used for connecting category

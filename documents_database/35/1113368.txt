sr bi functions as a receptor for high density lipoprotein scavenger receptor class b type i sr bi is an integral membrane protein found in numerous cell types tissues including the liver and adrenal it is best known for its role in facilitating the uptake of cholesteryl esters from high density lipoproteins in the liver this process drives the movement of cholesterol from peripheral tissues towards the liver where cholesterol can either be secreted via the bile duct or be used to synthesise steroid hormones this movement of cholesterol is known as reverse cholesterol transport and is a protective mechanism against the development of atherosclerosis which is the principal cause of heart disease and stroke sr bi is crucial in lipid soluble vitamin uptake in melanocytic cells scarb1 gene expression may be regulated by the mitf sr bi has also been identified in the livers of non mammalian species turtle goldfish shark chicken frog and skate suggesting it emerged early in vertebrate evolutionary history the turtle also seems to upregulate sr bi during egg development indicating that cholesterol efflux may be at peak levels during developmental stages scarb1 along with cd81 is the receptor for the entry of the hepatitis

it is designed to improve engine fuel efficiency without sacrificing performance it is an evolution of a long line of vtec systems from honda honda s advanced vtec technology departs greatly from its previous incarnations by no longer relying on switching between two sets of lobes on a given camshaft it instead uses a single cam lobe per valve and two rocker arms per valve whereby the second rocker arm has a movable pivot point there by provide the varying cam lift advanced vtec motors still use the now standard oil pressure controlled variable cam gear angle mechanism with these two technologies combined honda has developed an infinitely variable valve timing and lift system vvtl previous versions of vtec included only staged vvtl i e high low with the introduction of i vtec the systems gained infinitely variable valve timing but still only staged lift i e high low the infinitely variable portion of the a vtec is what makes it stand out as a serious evolutionary step in the world of vtec advanced vtec has a standard camshaft and rocker arms attached as they normally are with camshaft overhead and rocker arms pushing down on the poppet valves the

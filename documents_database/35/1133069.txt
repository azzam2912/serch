these genes encode leucine zipper proteins that can dimerize with proteins of the jun family e g c jun jund thereby forming the transcription factor complex ap 1 as such the fos proteins have been implicated as regulators of cell proliferation differentiation and transformation fosb and its truncated splice variants fosb and further truncated 2 fosb are all involved in osteosclerosis although 2 fosb lacks a known transactivation domain in turn preventing it from affecting transcription through the ap 1 complex the fosb splice variant has been identified as playing a central crucial necessary and sufficient role in the development and maintenance of addiction fosb overexpression i e an abnormally and excessively high level of fosb expression which produces a pronounced gene related phenotype triggers the development of addiction related neuroplasticity throughout the reward system and produces a behavioral phenotype that is characteristic of an addiction fosb differs from the full length fosb and further truncated 2 fosb in its capacity to produce these effects as only accumbal fosb overexpression is associated with pathological responses to drugs deltafosb more commonly written as fosb is a truncated splice variant of the fosb gene fosb has been implicated as a critical factor

examples include the integers the rationals and the real numbers the rationals and reals in fact form ordered fields the complex numbers in contrast do not form an ordered ring or field because there is no inherent order relationship between the elements 1 and i in analogy with the real numbers we call an element c of an ordered ring r positive if 0 c and negative if c 0 0 is considered to be neither positive nor negative the set of positive elements of an ordered ring r is often denoted by r an alternative notation favored in some disciplines is to use r for the set of nonnegative elements and r for the set of positive elements if a is an element of an ordered ring r then the absolute value of a denoted a is defined thus where a is the additive inverse of a and 0 is the additive identity element a discrete ordered ring or discretely ordered ring is an ordered ring in which there is no element between 0 and 1 the integers are a discrete ordered ring but the rational numbers are not for all a b and c in r the list

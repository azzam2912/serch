for most naturally occurring amino acids this carbon has the l configuration d amino acids are most occasionally found in nature as residues in proteins they are formed from ribosomally derived d amino acid residues l and d amino acids are usually enantiomers the exceptions are two amino acids with two stereogenic centers threonine and isoleucine aside from those two special cases l and d amino acids have identical properties color solubility melting point under many conditions in the biological context however which is chiral these enatiomers can behave very differently thus d amino acids have low nutritional value in part because they are not digested well two enzymes convert l amino acids to d amino acids d amino acid racemase a plp dependent enzyme racemizes amino acids via the formation of the alpha iminoacids where the stereogenic center is lost l amino acid oxidases convert l amino acids to the alpha ketoacids which are susceptible to reductive amination some amino acids are prone to racemization one example being lysine which racemizes via formation pipecolic acid in peptides l amino acid residues slowly racemize resulting in the formation of some d amino acid residues racemization occurs via deprotonation of the

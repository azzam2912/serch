however rnas have also been identified in metagenomics sequences derived from samples of dna or rna extracted from the environment which contain unknown species initial work in this area detected homologs of known bacterial rnas in such metagenome samples many of these rna sequences were distinct from sequences within cultivated bacteria and provide the potential for additional information on the rna classes to which they belong the distinct environmental sequences were exploited to detect previously unknown rnas in the marine bacterium pelagibacter ubique p ubique is extremely common in marine sequences so sequences of dna extracted from oceans many of which are inevitably derived from species related to p ubique were exploited to facilitate the analysis of possible secondary structures of rnas predicted in this species subsequent studies identified novel rnas exclusively using sequences extracted from environmental samples the first study determined the sequences of rnas directly extracted from microbial biomass in the pacific ocean the researches found that a large fraction of the total extracted rna molecules did not appear to code for protein but instead appear to conserve consistent rna secondary structures a number of these were shown to belong to known small rna sequence families including riboswitches

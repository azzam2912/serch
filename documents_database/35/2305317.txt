it targets the site 3 of voltage gated sodium channels thus mainly prolonging the inactivation time course of the channel bciii can be isolated from the venom of the sea anemone bunodosoma caissarum bciii belongs to type 1 sea anemone neurotoxins which target the subunits of voltage gated sodium channels na1 x it has 48 amino acids and a molecular mass of 4 976 atomic mass units the secondary structure of bciii consists of 4 0 helixes 43 4 strands 21 3 turns and 31 3 is unordered the three dimensional structure of bciii can be found on swiss model figure 1 the amino acid sequence of bciii bciii binds to voltage gated sodium channels on site 3 which is the extracellular loop connecting the segments s3 and s4 the voltage sensor segment of domain iv bciii has the biggest effect on na1 1 and na1 5 table 1 however the affinity of bciii to these sodium channels is relatively low in comparison with other toxins in the same family such as atx ii and aft ii table 1 the affinity of bciii to different sodium channels based on ec data bciii binds to site 3 of voltage gated sodium

the lamb shift has since played a significant role through vacuum energy fluctuations in theoretical prediction of hawking radiation from black holes this effect was first measured in 1947 in the lamb retherford experiment on the hydrogen microwave spectrum and this measurement provided the stimulus for renormalization theory to handle the divergences it was the harbinger of modern quantum electrodynamics developed by julian schwinger richard feynman ernst stueckelberg sin itiro tomonaga and freeman dyson lamb won the nobel prize in physics in 1955 for his discoveries related to the lamb shift on lamb s 65th birthday freeman dyson addressed him as follows those years when the lamb shift was the central theme of physics were golden years for all the physicists of my generation you were the first to see that this tiny shift so elusive and hard to measure would clarify our thinking about particles and fields this heuristic derivation of the electrodynamic level shift following welton is from quantum optics the fluctuation in the electric and magnetic fields associated with the qed vacuum perturbs the electric potential due to the atomic nucleus this perturbation causes a fluctuation in the position of the electron which explains the energy shift

the microbes might engage in a commensal mutualistic or pathogenic interaction with the host and include bacteria viruses unicellular eukaryotes and fungi in nature c elegans harbours a variety of different microbes in contrast c elegans strains that are cultivated in laboratories for research purposes have lost their naturally associated microbial communities and are commonly maintained on a single bacterial strain escherichia coli op50 c elegans is a well established model organism in different research fields yet its ecology however is only poorly understood c elegans were previously considered a soil living nematode but in the last 10 years it was shown that natural habitats of c elegans are microbe rich such as compost heaps rotten plant material and rotten fruits most of the studies on c elegans are based on the n2 strain which has adapted to laboratory conditions only in the last few years the natural ecology of c elegans has been studied in more detail and one current research focus is its interaction with microbes as c elegans feeds on bacteria microbivory the intestine of worms isolated from the wild is usually filled with a large number of bacteria in contrast to the very high diversity of

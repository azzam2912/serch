it was part of the new millennium program dedicated to testing advanced technologies launched on 24 october 1998 the deep space 1 spacecraft carried out a flyby of asteroid 9969 braille which was its primary science target the mission was extended twice to include an encounter with comet 19p borrelly and further engineering testing problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration while the flyby of the asteroid was only a partial success the encounter with the comet retrieved valuable information three of twelve technologies on board had to work within a few minutes of separation from the carrier rocket for the mission to continue the deep space series was continued by the deep space 2 probes which were launched in january 1999 piggybacked on the mars polar lander and were intended to strike the surface of mars though contact was lost and the mission failed deep space 1 was the first nasa spacecraft to use ion propulsion rather than the traditional chemical powered rockets the purpose of deep space 1 was technology development and validation for future missions 12 technologies were tested the autonav system developed by nasa s jet

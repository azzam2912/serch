this norm has many remarkable properties the most important being listed in this article to start with the geometry the bombieri scalar product for homogeneous polynomials with n variables can be defined as follows using multi index notation by definition different monomials are orthogonal so that while by definition in the above definition and in the rest of this article the following notation applies if write and and the fundamental property of this norm is the bombieri inequality let formula 12 be two homogeneous polynomials respectively of degree formula 13 and formula 14 with formula 15 variables then the following inequality holds here the bombieri inequality is the left hand side of the above statement while the right side means that the bombieri norm is an algebra norm giving the left hand side is meaningless without that constraint because in this case we can achieve the same result with any norm by multiplying the norm by a well chosen factor this multiplicative inequality implies that the product of two polynomials is bounded from below by a quantity that depends on the multiplicand polynomials thus this product can not be arbitrarily small this multiplicative inequality is useful in metric algebraic geometry

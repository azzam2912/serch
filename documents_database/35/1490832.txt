a notable representative of this tradition is the cucuteni trypillian culture which was centered on the burned house horizon both geographically and temporally there is still a discussion in the study of neolithic and eneolithic europe whether the majority of burned houses were intentionally set alight or not although the reasons behind why house burning was practiced are still debated the evidence seems to support that it occurred in such a way as to indicate it was highly unlikely to have been as a result of accidental cause if these regularly occurring burnings in which the entire settlement is destroyed were deliberate then there has still been a debate about why this happened however in recent years the consensus has begun to gel around the domicide theory supported by tringham stevanovic and others cucuteni trypillian settlements were completely burned every 75 80 years leaving behind successive layers consisting mostly of large amounts of rubble from the collapsed wattle and daub walls this rubble was mostly ceramic material that had been created as the raw clay used in the daub of the walls became vitrified from the intense heat that would have turned it a bright orange color during the conflagration

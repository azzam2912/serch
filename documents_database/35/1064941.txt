the cold spot is approximately 70 k 0 00007 k colder than the average cmb temperature approximately 2 7 k whereas the root mean square of typical temperature variations is only 18 k at some points the cold spot deviates 140 k colder than the average cmb temperature the radius of the cold spot subtends about 5 it is centered at the galactic coordinate l 207 8 b 56 3 equatorial it is therefore in the southern celestial hemisphere in the direction of the constellation eridanus typically the largest fluctuations of the primordial cmb temperature occur on angular scales of about 1 thus a cold region as large as the cold spot appears very unlikely given generally accepted theoretical models various alternative explanations exist including a so called eridanus supervoid or great void this would be an extremely large region of the universe roughly 150 to 300 mpc or 500 million to one billion light years across and 6 to 10 billion light years away at redshift formula 1 containing a density of matter much smaller than the average density at that redshift such a void would affect the observed cmb via the integrated sachs wolfe effect if a comparable

when all the theorems of a logic formalised in a structural proof theory have analytic proofs then the proof theory can be used to demonstrate such things as consistency provide decision procedures and allow mathematical or computational witnesses to be extracted as counterparts to theorems the kind of task that is more often given to model theory the notion of analytic proof was introduced into proof theory by gerhard gentzen for the sequent calculus the analytic proofs are those that are cut free his natural deduction calculus also supports a notion of analytic proof as was shown by dag prawitz the definition is slightly more complex the analytic proofs are the normal forms which are related to the notion of normal form in term rewriting the term structure in structural proof theory comes from a technical notion introduced in the sequent calculus the sequent calculus represents the judgement made at any stage of an inference using special extra logical operators called structural operators in formula 1 the commas to the left of the turnstile are operators normally interpreted as conjunctions those to the right as disjunctions whilst the turnstile symbol itself is interpreted as an implication however it is important

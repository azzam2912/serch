tlr2 has also been designated as cd282 cluster of differentiation 282 tlr2 is one of the toll like receptors and plays a role in the immune system tlr2 is a membrane protein a receptor which is expressed on the surface of certain cells and recognizes foreign substances and passes on appropriate signals to the cells of the immune system the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the toll like receptor tlr family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity tlrs are highly conserved from drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities they recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps that are expressed on infectious agents and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity the various tlrs exhibit different patterns of expression this gene is expressed most abundantly in peripheral blood leukocytes and mediates host response to gram positive bacteria and yeast via stimulation of nf b in the intestine tlr2 regulates the expression of cyp1a1 which is a key enzyme in detoxication of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo a pyrene the immune system recognizes foreign pathogens and eliminates them this occurs in several

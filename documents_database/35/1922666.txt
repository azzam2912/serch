the goal was well exceeded as 4 172 backers pledged 641 614 the udoo board is equipped with two cpus the freescale i mx 6 is an arm cortex a9 processor based on arm v7 instruction set next generation graphics and high definition video are central in the i mx 6 series the i mx 6 series supports up to 1080p60 video playback enabling exceptional high quality videos with low power consumption for devices playing high definition content the 3d graphics engine in the top of the line i mx 6 quad and i mx 6 dual processors are capable of providing up to 200 mt s which enables ultra vivid realistic graphics critical for multimedia these applications combine the power of the main cores with the until now untapped potential of the 3d engine to perform computational tasks otherwise atmel sam3x implements real time computing and allows full compatibility with arduino due prototyping board with this solution udoo can be used like an arduino due microcontroller and programmed in the same way they are both stand alone with different clocks and no shared memory they both process their tasks asynchronously without any kind of emulation they do however share

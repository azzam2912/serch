in this model diagnostic testing is often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies based on the context of a patient s genetic content or other molecular or cellular analysis tools employed in precision medicine can include molecular diagnostics imaging and analytics in explaining the distinction from a similar common term of personalized medicine the national research council explains on the other hand use of the term precision medicine can extend beyond treatment selection to also cover creating unique medical products for particular individuals for example patient specific tissue or organs to tailor treatments for different people hence the term in practice has so much overlap with personalized medicine that they are often used interchangeably precision medicine often involves the application of panomic analysis and systems biology to analyze the cause of an individual patient s disease at the molecular level and then to utilize targeted treatments possibly in combination to address that individual patient s disease process the patient s response is then tracked as closely as possible often using surrogate measures such as tumor load v true outcomes such as 5 year survival rate and the treatment finely adapted to the patient s response the branch of precision

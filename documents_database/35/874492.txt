for longer ranges see sub orbital spaceflight the maximum horizontal distance traveled by the projectile neglecting air resistance can be calculated as follows where if y is taken to be zero meaning that the object is being launched on flat ground the range of the projectile will simplify to ideal projectile motion states that there is no air resistance and no change in gravitational acceleration this assumption simplifies the mathematics greatly and is a close approximation of actual projectile motion in cases where the distances travelled are small ideal projectile motion is also a good introduction to the topic before adding the complications of air resistance a launch angle of 45 degrees displaces the projectile the farthest horizontally this is due to the nature of right triangles additionally from the equation for the range we can see that the range will be maximum when the value of formula 4 is the highest i e when it is equal to 1 clearly formula 5 has to be 90 degrees that is to say formula 6 is 45 degrees first we examine the case where y is zero the horizontal position of the projectile is in the vertical direction we are interested

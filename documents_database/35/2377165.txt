it was a 1 8 meter long free flying hypersonic scramjet a scramjet is fundamentally an air breathing engine that travels at hypersonic velocities built in brisbane at an estimated cost of 14 million it took approximately 3 years to complete scramspace was supposed to fire at a hypersonic velocity of mach 8 or 8600 km hour 5343 mph but the flight test turned out to be a failure and the rocket engine and the payload plummeted in the north sea off the coast of norway scramspace was designed and built at brisbane australia it took 3 years to build and was estimated to cost around 14 million it was approximated to fly at around mach 8 it was the first and the largest research project funded by the australian space research program a number of ground based research tests and mach 8 flight experiments were involved to establish the research project a number of engineers and phd scholars were involved in the making of this project ground tests up to mach 14 were performed to assess the scientific and technical parameters of the project this was followed by flight tests up to mach 8 the project involved five countries

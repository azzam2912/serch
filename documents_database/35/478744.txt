the topology on them can be defined by a family of seminorms whose unit balls decrease rapidly in size vector spaces whose elements are smooth in some sense tend to be nuclear spaces a typical example of a nuclear space is the set of smooth functions on a compact manifold all finite dimensional vector spaces are nuclear because every operator on a finite dimensional vector space is nuclear there are no banach spaces that are nuclear except for the finite dimensional ones in practice a sort of converse to this is often true if a naturally occurring topological vector space is not a banach space then there is a good chance that it is nuclear much of the theory of nuclear spaces was developed by alexander grothendieck while investigating the schwartz kernel theorem and published in this section lists some of the more common definitions of a nuclear space the definitions below are all equivalent note that some authors use a more restrictive definition of a nuclear space by adding the condition that the space should be fr chet this means that the space is complete and the topology is given by a countable family of seminorms we start by

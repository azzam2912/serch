the 223 designation is a reference to the popular 223 remington it is currently claimed to be the fastest production 22 caliber round in the world with muzzle velocities as high as 4 600 feet per second 1 402 meters per second but this is not completely true the 220 swift still holds the record as the fastest 22 caliber centerfire cartridge with a published velocity of 4665 fps using a 29 grain projectile and 42 grains of 3031 powder even before the cartridge was commercially introduced it was claimed that it would be extremely hard on barrels and high wear would lead to short barrel life another criticism is that although the round is suited for long range varmint hunting it is not good for medium game any farther than 200 yards the winchester made model 70 in 223 wssm has not been revived in the new browning made winchester model 70s but browning has chosen to use chrome lined barrels on all of its guns chambered for 223 wssm and has introduced the 223 wssm cartridge as a chambering in its a bolt rifles browning rejects the charge that the 223 wssm round is especially hard on barrels

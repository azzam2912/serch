it has specialized in measurement control and design technologies for robotics and production systems orchestra control engine is flexible because it can be customized this is done visually the solutions created are open based on an open source framework and are extendible modular components of the software allow a user to develop debug and test control applications for example previously developed algorithms can be divided into functional units and reused indefinitely all the units work together the software can be distributed among various remote hardware devices which may be hundreds of meters apart it also scalable in that it selects hardware which provides the best cost and performance for a particular operation the system s parameters can be quickly reconfigured both on line and also at the time of a run linux rtai creates orchestra control engine s hard real time behaviour its open source characteristics allow changes to fit the users requirements non hard real time components of orchestra control engine can be used with non linux platforms such as microsoft windows or macintosh a hard real time multithreaded engine operates in multicore multiprocessor architectures within the scheme modules can be filled in with more or less complex algorithms

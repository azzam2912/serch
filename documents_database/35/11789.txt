they are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity their number varies according to the approximately 11 year solar cycle individual sunspots or groups of sunspots may last anywhere from a few days to a few months but eventually decay sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the sun with diameters ranging from to larger sunspots can be visible from earth without the aid of a telescope they may travel at relative speeds or proper motions of a few hundred meters per second when they first emerge indicating intense magnetic activity sunspots accompany secondary phenomena such as coronal loops prominences and reconnection events most solar flares and coronal mass ejections originate in magnetically active regions around visible sunspot groupings similar phenomena indirectly observed on stars other than the sun are commonly called starspots and both light and dark spots have been measured the earliest extant report of sunspots dates back to the chinese book of changes the first clear mention of a sunspot in western literature around 300 bc was by the ancient greek scholar theophrastus student of plato

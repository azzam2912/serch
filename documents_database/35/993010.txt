electric third rail territory ends just north of the station so most trains are diesel bi level trains but one electric train a day train 1501 originates here during the morning rush hour this is the only oyster bay branch station located in fare zone 4 east williston s station house opened in february 1880 by the glen cove branch rail road it originally contained a freight house and wooden platform shelters that were closed during the mid 20th century the third rail was installed from mineola to east williston in june 1934 because there were originally plans to electrify the entire oyster bay branch however this did not occur it was also a convenient less busy location to turn back electric trains to mineola a service since made redundant by subsequent extensions of the electrification to hicksville and beyond the canopies surrounding the station house began to sag by 1960 and the lirr considered closing it along with albertson station and combining the two stations in between the current existing ones however after a great deal of community opposition those plans were shelved and east williston s canopies were restored between 1965 and 1966 high level platforms were added

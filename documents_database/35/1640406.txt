it is estimated that mixotrophs comprise more than half of all microscopic plankton there are two types of eukaryotic mixotrophs those with their own chloroplasts and those with endosymbionts and those that acquire them through kleptoplasty or by enslaving the entire phototrophic cell possible combinations are photo and chemotrophy litho and organotrophy osmotrophy phagotrophy and myzocytosis auto and heterotrophy or other combinations of these mixotrophs can be either eukaryotic or prokaryotic they can take advantage of different environmental conditions if a trophic mode is obligate then it is always necessary for sustaining growth and maintenance if facultative it can be used as a supplemental source some organisms have incomplete calvin cycles so they are incapable of fixing carbon dioxide and must use organic carbon sources organisms may employ mixotrophy obligately or facultatively to characterize the sub domains within mixotrophy several very similar categorization schemes have been suggested consider the example of a marine protist with heterotrophic and photosynthetic capabilities in the breakdown put forward by jones there are four mixotrophic groups based on relative roles of phagotrophy and phototrophy an alternative scheme by stoeker also takes into account the role of nutrients and growth factors and includes mixotrophs that have

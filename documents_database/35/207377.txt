hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive easily becoming hydroxyl groups and consequently short lived however they form an important part of radical chemistry most notably hydroxyl radicals are produced from the decomposition of hydroperoxides rooh or in atmospheric chemistry by the reaction of excited atomic oxygen with water it is also an important radical formed in radiation chemistry since it leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen which can enhance corrosion and scc in coolant systems subjected to radioactive environments hydroxyl radicals are also produced during uv light dissociation of ho suggested in 1879 and likely in fenton chemistry where trace amounts of reduced transition metals catalyze peroxide mediated oxidations of organic compounds in organic synthesis hydroxyl radicals are most commonly generated by photolysis of 1 hydroxy 2 1 h pyridinethione the hydroxyl radical is often referred to as the detergent of the troposphere because it reacts with many pollutants decomposing them through cracking often acting as the first step to their removal it also has an important role in eliminating some greenhouse gases like methane and ozone the rate of reaction with the hydroxyl radical often determines how long many pollutants last in the atmosphere if they do

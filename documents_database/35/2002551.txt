it is a pre competitive collaboration which main goal is to create and distribute tools to predict drug side effects based on pre clinical experiments aims are a better in silico predictability of potential adverse events and a decrease of the use of animals in toxicological research etox is funded by the innovative medicines initiative imi the official title of the consortium is integrating bioinformatics and chemoinformatics approaches for the development of expert systems allowing the in silico prediction of toxicities etox etox aims at creating in silico tools to predict the toxicity of small molecules during early stages of the drug development pipeline the consortium is assembling predictive model based on a set of toxicology reports curated by pharmaceutical companies who joined the consortium in the spirit of the imi etox bring together private companies producing preclinical data and academic partners experts on cheminformatics bioinformatics and natural language processing contribution to public domain of algorithms software and ontologies is part of the road map to achieve these goal a consortium bringing together 25 pharmaceutical companies biotech companies and university was created the project was started in 2010 it was originally funded for 5 years by consortium partners and the

in the international system of units si it is defined as a derived unit of 1 joule per second and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer in dimensional analysis power is described by formula 1 when an object s velocity is held constant at one meter per second against a constant opposing force of one newton the rate at which work is done is 1 watt in terms of electromagnetism one watt is the rate at which electrical work is performed when a current of one ampere a flows across an electrical potential difference of one volt v meaning the watt is equivalent to the volt ampere the latter unit however is used for a different quantity from the real power of an electrical circuit two additional unit conversions for watt can be found using the above equation and ohm s law where ohm formula 5 is the si derived unit of electrical resistance the watt is named after the scottish inventor james watt this unit was proposed initially by c william siemens in august 1882 in his president s address to the fifty second congress of the british association for the advancement of science noting that

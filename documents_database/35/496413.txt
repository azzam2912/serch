it occurs in the canopy i e canopy interception and in the forest floor or litter layer i e forest floor interception because of evaporation interception of liquid water generally leads to loss of that precipitation for the drainage basin except for cases such as fog interception but increase flood protection dramatically alila et al 2009 intercepted snowfall does not result in any notable amount of evaporation and most of the snow falls off the tree by wind or melts however intercepted snow can more easily drift with the wind out of the watershed conifers have a greater interception capacity than hardwoods their needles gives them more surface area for droplets to adhere to and they have foliage in spring and fall therefore interception also depends on the type of vegetation in a wooded area mitscherlich in 1971 calculated the water storage potential as interception values for different species and stand densities a storm event might produce 50 100 mm of rainfall and 4 mm might be the maximum intercepted in this way grah and wilson in 1944 did sprinkling experiments where they watered plants to see how much of the intercepted is kept after watering stops the interception depends

likewise an edge labelling is a function of formula 3 to a set of labels in this case the graph is called an edge labeled graph when the edge labels are members of an ordered set e g the real numbers it may be called a weighted graph when used without qualification the term labeled graph generally refers to a vertex labeled graph with all labels distinct such a graph may equivalently be labeled by the consecutive integers formula 4 where formula 5 is the number of vertices in the graph for many applications the edges or vertices are given labels that are meaningful in the associated domain for example the edges may be assigned weights representing the cost of traversing between the incident vertices in the above definition a graph is understood to be a finite undirected simple graph however the notion of labelling may be applied to all extensions and generalizations of graphs for example in automata theory and formal language theory it is convenient to consider labeled multigraphs i e a pair of vertices may be connected by several labeled edges most graph labellings trace their origins to labellings presented by alexander rosa in his 1967 paper

while sunnis regard umar ibn al khattab in high esteem and respect his place as one of the four righteously guided caliphs the shia do not view him as a legitimate leader of the ummah and believe that umar and abu bakr conspired to usurp power from ali shia believe that the sunni view of umar was created by the later umayyad dynasty to honour the man that gave power to the first umayyad ruler and third sunni caliph uthman in this way it gives legitimacy to umar s consultation that started their own dynasty shia believe that the umayyad view was propagated with lethal force and heavy duress and as time went on that view became predominant and eventually taken as truth cemented by the works of bukhari however shi a believe that despite the perceived white washing of umar bits of his true qualities can be found in all sources including sunni ones they also believe that invented positive traits attributed to him do not hold up to closer scrutiny a sh ia scholar states hafsa the daughter of umar was originally married to khunais ibn hudhaifa when he died umar sought to find a husband for her

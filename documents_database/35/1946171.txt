it was rediscovered in 2013 on a single volcanic ridge on the central azores island of s o jorge and is arguably europe s rarest bona fide orchid species while p azorica was previously considered by some sources to be the same as platanthera micrantha the 2013 discovery triggered a thorough analysis of historic and current data and specimens resulting in three species identified platanthera azorica is currently known to grow only in a single small upland area of s o jorge hochstetter s earlier expedition did not include s o jorge so at least at one time it lived on another azorean island genetic testing confirms that the lineage of the species derives from europe or north africa rather than north america as had been previously hypothesized and evidence suggests that the azorean lineage represents a single migration of seed to the archipelago from a mainland european population there are now three distinct species of azorean butterfly orchids the previously known p micrantha was listed by the iucn red list of threatened species as vulnerable but that was under the assumption that all three azorean butterfly orchids comprised a single species justification was given that the population is decreasing

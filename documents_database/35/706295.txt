materialise mimics is used to create 3d surface models from stacks of 2d image data these 3d models can then be used for a variety of engineering applications mimics is an acronym for materialise interactive medical image control system it is developed in an iso environment with ce and fda 510k premarket clearance materialise mimics is commercially available as part of the materialise mimics innovation suite which also contains materialise 3 matic a design and meshing software for anatomical data the current version is 20 0 it supports windows 10 windows 7 vista and xp in x64 materialise mimics calculates surface 3d models from stacked image data such as computed tomography ct micro ct magnetic resonance imaging mri confocal microscopy x ray and ultrasound through image segmentation the roi selected in the segmentation process is converted to a 3d surface model using an adapted marching cubes algorithm that takes the partial volume effect into account leading to very accurate 3d models the 3d files are represented in the stl format dicom data from ct or mri images can be uploaded into materialise mimics in order to begin the segmentation process from this data 3 different views are present the coronal

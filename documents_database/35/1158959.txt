keating introduced in 1966 to describe forces induced on neighboring atoms when one atom moves in a solid the term most often applies to the forces on first and second nearest neighboring atoms that arise when an atom is moved in tetrahedrally bonded solids such as diamond silicon germanium and a number of other covalent crystals with the diamond or zinc blende structures crystalline solids generally consist of an ordered array of interconnected atoms generated by repetition of a unit cell in three dimensions and are of two extreme types ionic crystals and covalent crystals others are intermediate partly ionic and partly covalent ionic crystals are made up of quite different ions such as na and cl in common salt for example while covalent crystals such as diamond are made up of atoms that share electrons in a covalent bond in either case attractive and repulsive forces resist moving an atom ion or a set of them from their equilibrium positions thus giving solids their rigidity against compressive tensile and shear stresses the nature and strength of these forces is important for the scientific understanding of solids since they determine the way the solid responds to these stresses elastic constants

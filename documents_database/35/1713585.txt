great care had been taken in the design to eliminate drag and the design had been tested on gustave eiffel s wind tunnel the aircraft had a streamlined circular section fuselage which entirely enclosed the gnome rotary engine which drove a pusher configuration propeller mounted at the back of the fuselage connected to the engine by a long driveshaft the structure of the fuselage was a conventional square section wire braced wood structure outside which were circular formers bearing a series of stringers to support the fabric covering initially a universal joint was fitted at the engine end of the driveshaft but in tests the girder construction of the fuselage proved rigid enough for this not to be necessary and the long tube forming the driveshaft was simply held by six ballraces attached to the structure by wires to eliminate whip the section of the fuselage containing the engine was covered by louvred aluminium panels removable for maintenance of the engine the wings had curved leading and trailing edges were tapered in planform and were curved upwards at the wing tips flight loads were transmitted to the bottom of the fuselage by a pair of steel ribbons on either side

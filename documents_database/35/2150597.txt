however their significance is limited more to their existences and structures than to their reactivity the cyclopentadienyl ligands of f block metallocenes were considered as inert ancillary ligands only capable of enhancing their stability and solubility but not their reactivity in addition only late and small metals in the lanthanide series i e elements from sm to lu are trivalent metallocene complexes ch lnz in 1980 the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand cme was introduced to prepare the lanthanide complexes with all metals in the series apart from improving the stability and solubility of the complexes it was demonstrated to participate in organometallic reactions subsequently william j evans and his coworkers successfully isolated cme sm thf and cme sm making a breakthrough in f block metallocenes since both of these two organosamarium ii complexes were unexpectedly found to participate in the coordination activation and transformation of a variety of unsaturated compounds including olefins dinitrogen internal alkynens phosphaalkynes carbon monoxide carbon dioxide isonitriles diazine derivatives imines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs moreover due to its strong reducing potential it was used to synthesize cme sm h and other trivalent f block element complexes subsequently tris pentamethylcyclopentadienyl lanthanide complexes cme ln and their relevant complexes

the parity function of two inputs is also known as the xor function the parity function is notable for its role in theoretical investigation of circuit complexity of boolean functions the output of the parity function is the parity bit the formula 1 variable parity function is the boolean function formula 2 with the property that formula 3 if and only if the number of ones in the vector formula 4 is odd in other words formula 5 is defined as follows where formula 7 denotes exclusive or parity only depends on the number of ones and is therefore a symmetric boolean function the n variable parity function and its negation are the only boolean functions for which all disjunctive normal forms have the maximal number of 2 monomials of length n and all conjunctive normal forms have the maximal number of 2 clauses of length n some of the earliest work in computational complexity was 1961 bound of bella subbotovskaya showing the size of a boolean formula computing parity must be at least formula 8 this work uses the method of random restrictions this exponent of formula 9 has been increased through careful analysis to formula 10 by paterson

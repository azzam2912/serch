physically a nonmetal tends to have a relatively low melting point boiling point and density a nonmetal is typically brittle when solid and usually has poor thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity chemically nonmetals tend to have relatively high ionization energy electron affinity and electronegativity they gain or share electrons when they react with other elements and chemical compounds seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals most are gases hydrogen helium nitrogen oxygen fluorine neon chlorine argon krypton xenon and radon one is a liquid bromine and a few are solids carbon phosphorus sulfur selenium and iodine metalloids such as boron silicon and germanium are sometimes counted as nonmetals the nonmetals are divided into two categories reflecting their relative propensity to form chemical compounds reactive nonmetals and noble gases the reactive nonmetals vary in their nonmetallic character the less electronegative of them such as carbon and sulfur mostly have weak to moderately strong nonmetallic properties and tend to form covalent compounds with metals the more electronegative of the reactive nonmetals such as oxygen and fluorine are characterised by stronger nonmetallic properties and a tendency to form predominantly ionic compounds with metals the noble gases are distinguished by their great reluctance to

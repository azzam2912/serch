it is sometimes known by the brand name of tufftride tenifer or melonite three steps are involved nitrocarburize quench polish and post oxidize quench this process is often used when two or more of the following properties are required in a workpiece common applications of the process are for piston rods of shock absorbers cylinders and rods for hydraulic systems pumps axles spindles and valves the process starts with a standard salt bath nitrocarburizing cycle which produces a layer of iron nitride next the workpiece is mechanically polished typical polishing processes include vibratory finishing lapping and centerless grinding finally the workpiece is re immersed into the salt quench bath for 20 to 30 minutes rinsed and oil dipped this last step optimizes the corrosion resistance by creating a layer of iron oxide about 3 to 4 micrometers thick it also gives the workpiece a black finish the chart on the right shows a comparison of corrosion resistance against other surface treatments based on field immersion tests test conditions for the immersion test are full immersion in 3 sodium chloride plus 3 g l of hydrogen peroxide for 24 hours the chart on the right shows a comparison of the corrosion

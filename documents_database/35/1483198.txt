it underlies large area that extends from southern boundary of the northwest territories in canada to north dakota in the united states it has been subdivided into numerous formations many which host major petroleum and natural gas reservoirs the formations of the elk point group are composed primarily of carbonate rocks dolomite and limestone and evaporitic rocks halite anhydrite and potash with lesser amounts of dolomitic mudstone and shale some of the carbonate formations of the elk point group contain rich assemblages of marine invertebrate fossils including many species of brachiopods gastropods bivalves cephalopods crinoids ostracods and corals the evaporitic formations are unfossiliferous or contain a few spores and algal remains the formations of the elk point group were deposited in a marine embayment that stretched from an open ocean in the present day northwest territories of canada to north dakota in the united states covering an area roughly half as large as that covered by today s mediterranean sea at times of low water levels and excessive evaporation halite and other evaporite minerals were deposited in sabkha supratidal flat and coastal lagoon environments and at times of higher water levels carbonate platform sedimentation and reef growth were dominant the

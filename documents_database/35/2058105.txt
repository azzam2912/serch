it was used to produce graphics output from mainframes and minicomputers dec used the term waveform graphics to refer specifically to the hardware but it was used more generally to describe the whole system the system was designed to use as little computer memory as possible at any given x location it could draw two dots at given y locations making it suitable for producing two superimposed waveforms line charts or histograms text and graphics could be mixed and there were additional tools for drawing axes and markers the waveform graphics system was used only for a short period of time before it was replaced by the more sophisticated regis system first introduced on the vt125 in 1981 regis allowed the construction of arbitrary vectors and other shapes whereas dec normally provided a backward compatible solution in newer terminal models they did not choose to do this when regis was introduced and waveform graphics disappeared from later terminals waveform graphics was introduced on the vt55 terminal in october 1975 an era when memory was extremely expensive although it was technically possible to produce a bitmap display using a framebuffer using technology of the era the memory needed to do so

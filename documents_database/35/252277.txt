in other words formula 3 forms a subalgebra of the power set boolean algebra of formula 2 many authors refer to formula 3 itself as a field of sets elements of formula 4 are called points and those of formula 3 are called complexes and are said to be the admissible sets of formula 2 fields of sets should not be confused with fields in ring theory nor with fields in physics similarly the term algebra over formula 4 is used in the sense of a boolean algebra and should not be confused with algebras over fields or rings in ring theory fields of sets play an essential role in the representation theory of boolean algebras every boolean algebra can be represented as a field of sets every finite boolean algebra can be represented as a whole power set the power set of its set of atoms each element of the boolean algebra corresponds to the set of atoms below it the join of which is the element this power set representation can be constructed more generally for any complete atomic boolean algebra in the case of boolean algebras which are not complete and atomic we can still generalize the

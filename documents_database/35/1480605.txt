this phenomenon is frequently associated with damage to the right cerebral hemisphere resulting in severe sensory deficits that are observed on the contralesional left side of the body a right sided deficit is less commonly observed and the effects are reported to be temporary and minor evidence suggests that the right cerebral hemisphere has a dominant role in attention and awareness to somatic sensations through ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation in contrast the left cerebral hemisphere is activated only by contralateral stimuli thus the left and right cerebral hemispheres exhibit redundant processing to the right side of the body and a lesion to the left cerebral hemisphere can be compensated by the ipsiversive processes of the right cerebral hemisphere for this reason right sided amorphosynthesis is less often observed and is generally associated with bilateral lesions brain areas in the parietal lobes play an integral role in processing and interpreting somatic sensations from the body or environment the right parietal lobe is associated with sensory integration and perception whereas the left parietal lobe is believed to function at a more conceptual level involving speech reading and writing the central sulcus divides the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe which is located

the toxin belongs to the class family of sodium channel inhibiting scorpion toxins it affects voltage dependent activation conductance and resurgent currents of voltage gated sodium channels by binding to site 4 cll2 is named after the venom produced by the species centruroides limpidus limpidus cll a mexican scorpion cll1 and cll2 are both derived from this venom the centruroides limpidus limpidus species is a member of the only genus that represents a life hazard to humans in mexico and is mainly found in the state of morelos cll2 belongs to the beta type of sodium channel inhibiting scorpion toxins the cll venom consists of six fractions of which only cll2 is lethal amounting to 42 of the venom cll2 consists of thirteen sub fractions of which sub fraction 9 is the largest the molecular weight of cll2 is about 7600 da the primary structure of the cll2 toxin toxin ii 9 is like other scorpion beta toxins beta sctxs cll2 targets voltage gated sodium channels vgscs it specifically binds to and alters the na1 6 channel as well as but to a lesser extent other nav isoforms it binds to the extracellular end of the iss4 loop between the

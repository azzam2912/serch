after spending around six months writing music for the film jackman recorded the album at air studios in london during the latter part of 2013 about the score jackman said it s 50 production and all the tricks i ve learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it s also got the kind of injection of symphonic thematic heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical and hopefully coherent piece while the beginning of the film contains alan silvestri s themes from these cues are absent on the soundtrack album the score received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics with much of the criticism being directed towards jackman s overuse of electronic sounds and the absence of alan silvestri s themes from j rn tillnes writing for soundtrack geek dismissed the score as weird stating what i wanted was the silvestri score added badass ness but instead i got weirdness even if the score wasn t as expected this would still come across as a weird score to me and i just don t like it very much james southall of movie wave said that the album starts badly and proceeds to get much worse ultimately

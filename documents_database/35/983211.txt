this process forms part of the innate immune response involving the recruitment of non specific leukocytes monocytes also use this process in the absence of infection or tissue damage during their development into macrophages leukocyte extravasation occurs mainly in post capillary venules where haemodynamic shear forces are minimised this process can be understood in several steps it has been demonstrated that leukocyte recruitment is halted whenever any of these steps is suppressed white blood cells leukocytes perform most of their functions in tissues functions include phagocytosis of foreign particles production of antibodies secretion of inflammatory response triggers histamine and heparin and neutralization of histamine in general leukocytes are involved in the defense of an organism and protect it from disease by promoting or inhibiting inflammatory responses leukocytes use the blood as a transport medium to reach the tissues of the body here is a brief summary of each of the four steps currently thought to be involved in leukocyte extravasation upon recognition of and activation by pathogens resident macrophages in the affected tissue release cytokines such as il 1 tnf and chemokines il 1 tnf and c5a cause the endothelial cells of blood vessels near the site of infection to

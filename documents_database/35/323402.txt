each cerebral hemisphere contains a lateral ventricle known as the left or right ventricle respectively each lateral ventricle resembles a c shaped structure that begins at an inferior horn in the temporal lobe travels through a body in the parietal lobe and frontal lobe and ultimately terminates at the interventricular foramina where each lateral ventricle connects to the single central third ventricle along the path a posterior horn extends backward into the occipital lobe and an anterior horn extends farther into the frontal lobe each lateral ventricle takes the form of an elongated curve with an additional anterior facing continuation emerging inferiorly from a point near the posterior end of the curve the junction is known as the trigone of the lateral ventricle the centre of the superior curve is referred to as the body while the three remaining portions are known as horns cornua in latin they are usually referred to by their position relative to the body anterior posterior or inferior or sometimes by the lobe of the cerebral cortex into which they extend though somewhat flat the lateral ventricles have a vaguely triangular cross section ependyma which are epithelial cells cover the inside of the lateral ventricles

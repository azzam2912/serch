for linear systems in particular these modes and frequencies are analogous to the normal modes of the system but more generally they are approximations of the modes and eigenvalues of the composition operator also called the koopman operator due to the intrinsic temporal behaviors associated with each mode dmd differs from dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis which computes orthogonal modes that lack predetermined temporal behaviors because its modes are not orthogonal dmd based representations can be less parsimonious than those generated by pca however they can also be more physically meaningful because each mode is associated with a damped or driven sinusoidal behavior in time dynamic mode decomposition was first introduced by schmid as a numerical procedure for extracting dynamical features from flow data the data takes the form of a snapshot sequence where formula 2 is the formula 3 th snapshot of the flow field and formula 4 is a data matrix whose columns are the individual snapshots the subscript and superscript denote the index of the snapshot in the first and last columns respectively these snapshots are assumed to be related via a linear mapping that defines a linear dynamical system that remains approximately the

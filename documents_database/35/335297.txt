it supports hardware acceleration of all x opengl and xvideo applications and graphical effects by a compositing window manager such as compiz or beryl the project was started by david reveman of novell and first released on january 2 2006 it was removed from the x org server in favor of aiglx on june 12 2008 xgl was originally developed on public mailing lists but for a long time until january 2 2006 most development of xgl was done behind closed doors on that day the source to xgl was re opened to the public and included in freedesktop org along with major restructuring to allow a wider range of supported display drivers x server backends used by xgl include xglx and xegl in february 2006 the server gained wide publicity after a public display where the novell desktop team demonstrated a desktop using xgl with several visual effects such as translucent windows and a rotating 3d desktop the effects had first been implemented in a composite manager called glxcompmgr not to be confused with xcompmgr now deprecated because several effects could not be adequately implemented without tighter interaction between the window manager and the composite manager as a solution

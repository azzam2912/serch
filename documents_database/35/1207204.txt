the accelerator has contributed to fundamental research in high energy physics and accelerator physics as well as solid state physics biology art history and other fields through its use as a synchrotron light source for many years cesr held the world luminosity record for electron positron collisions cesr pioneered several new accelerator techniques including superconducting radio frequency cavities and pretzel orbits cesr was built in the already existing tunnel for the 10 gev synchrotron and was originally constructed as an electron positron collider the project was led by cornell physicist maury tigner who devised a fiendishly clever method of filling the ring with positrons generated by the synchrotron it delivered its first collisions in april 1979 setting the world record for the highest luminosity electron positron collisions from this point on the accelerator provided a reliable beam of high energy electrons and positrons to the cleo and cusb particle detectors the name cleo is a play on words and not an acronym the name was chosen because it is short for cleopatra due to her relationship with caesar collisions occurred at a center of mass energy ranging from 3 5 gev to 12 gev at its peak this turned out

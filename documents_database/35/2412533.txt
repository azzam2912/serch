in order to calculate formula 4 consider the integrand formula 5 we consider the behavior of this entire integrand including the formula 6 under translation and reflections of the t axis the translations and reflections are ones that correspond to the symmetries and periodicities of the basic trigonometric functions bioche s rules state that because rules 1 and 2 involve flipping the t axis they flip the sign of dt and therefore the behavior of under these transformations differs from that of by a sign although the rules could be stated in terms of stating them in terms of has a mnemonic advantage which is that we choose the change of variables u t that has the same symmetry as as a trivial example consider then formula 16 is an odd function but under a reflection of the t axis about the origin stays the same that is acts like an even function this is the same as the symmetry of the cosine which is an even function so the mnemomic tells us to use the substitution formula 8 rule 1 under this substitution the integral becomes formula 18 the integrand involving transcendental functions has been reduced to one involving

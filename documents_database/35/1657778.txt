this alignment is perturbed by applying a short oscillating field usually a microwave pulse one can then measure the emitted microwave signal which is created by the sample magnetization fourier transformation of the microwave signal yields an epr spectrum in the frequency domain with a vast variety of pulse sequences it is possible to gain extensive knowledge on structural and dynamical properties of paramagnetic compounds pulsed epr techniques such as electron spin echo envelope modulation eseem or pulsed electron nuclear double resonance endor can reveal the interactions of the electron spin with its surrounding nuclear spins electron paramagnetic resonance epr or electron spin resonance esr is a spectroscopic technique widely used in biology chemistry medicine and physics to study systems with one or more unpaired electrons because of the specific relation between the magnetic parameters electronic wavefunction and the configuration of the surrounding non zero spin nuclei epr and endor provide information on the structure dynamics and the spatial distribution of the paramagnetic species however these techniques are limited in spectral and time resolution when used with traditional continuous wave methods this resolution can be improved in pulsed epr by investigating interactions separately from each other via pulse sequences r

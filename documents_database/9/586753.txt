this spheroid is named after the scottish mathematician colin maclaurin who formulated it for the shape of earth in 1742 in fact the figure of the earth is far less oblate than this since the earth is not homogeneous but has a dense iron core the maclaurin spheroid is considered to be the simplest model of rotating ellipsoidal figures in equilibrium since it assumes uniform density for a spheroid with equatorial semi major axis formula 1 and polar semi minor axis formula 2 the angular velocity formula 3 about formula 2 is given by maclaurin s formula where formula 6 is the eccentricity of meridional cross sections of the spheroid formula 7 is the density and formula 8 is the gravitational constant the formula predicts two possible equilibrium figures when formula 9 one is a sphere formula 10 and the other is a very flattened spheroid formula 11 the maximum angular velocity occurs at eccentricity formula 12 and its value is formula 13 so that above this speed no equilibrium figures exist the angular momentum formula 14 is where formula 16 is the mass of the spheroid and formula 17 is the mean radius the radius of a sphere of

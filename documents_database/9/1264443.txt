this is achieved through use of a data structure which both describes and contains biometric data cbeff defines abstract data elements used to construct biometric information record birs a bir consists of the biometric data block bdb format requirements are not defined by cbeff instead the root header sbh identifies the remaining bir data elements such as the bdb type and information related to any child or sibling birs if included the optional security block sb specifies encryption and integrity information for the entire structure cbeff defines the following types of cbeff bir structures these cbeff bir structures allow different bir contents and configurations including single birs child birs and multiple linked birs to meet the demands of a given domain of use a cbeff patron format is then defined using one of the cbeff bir structures the cbeff patron format definition will specify the required and optional cbeff data elements any patron specific data elements and any abstract values a specific cbeff patron format can then be used by one or more entities to exchange biometric data cbeff bir structures and data elements can be seen as the building blocks for the cbeff patron formats used for biometric data

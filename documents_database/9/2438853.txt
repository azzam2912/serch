the process of such a linkage is known as protein lipidation and falls into the wider category of acylation and post translational modification proteolipids are abundant in brain tissue and are also present in many other animal and plant tissues they are proteins covalenently bound to fatty acid chains often granting them an interface for interacting with biological membranes they are not to be confused with lipoproteins a kind of spherical assembly made up of many molecules of lipids and some apolipoproteins depending on the type of fatty acid attached to the protein a proteolipid can often contain myristoyl palmitoyl or prenyl groups these groups each serve different functions and have different preferences as to which amino acid residue they attach to the processes are respectively named myristoylation usually at n terminal gly palmitoylation to cysteine and prenylation also to cysteine despite the seemingly specific names n myristoylation and s palmitoylation can also involve some other fatty acids most commonly in plants and viral proteolipids the article on lipid anchored proteins has more information on these canonical classes there exist some rarer forms of protein acylation that may not have a membrane related function they include serine o octanoylation in

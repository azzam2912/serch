nuclides are composed of protons and neutrons the shape of the valley refers to the profile of binding energy as a function of the numbers of neutrons and protons with the lowest part of the valley corresponding to the region of most stable nuclei the line of stable nuclides down the center of the valley of stability is known as the line of beta stability the sides of the valley correspond to increasing instability to beta decay or the decay of a nuclide becomes more energetically favorable the further it is from the line of beta stability the boundaries of the valley correspond to the nuclear drip lines where nuclides become so unstable they emit single protons or single neutrons regions of instability within the valley at high atomic number also include radioactive decay by alpha radiation or spontaneous fission the shape of the valley is roughly an elongated paraboloid corresponding to the nuclide binding energies as a function of neutron and atomic numbers the nuclides within the valley of stability encompass the entire table of nuclides the chart of those nuclides is known as a segr chart after the physicist emilio segr the segr chart may be considered a

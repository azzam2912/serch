a pcell represents a part or a component of the circuit whose structure is dependent on one or more parameters hence it is a cell which is automatically generated by electronic design automation eda software based on the values of these parameters for example one can create a transistor pcell and then use different instances of the same with different user defined lengths and widths vendors of eda software sometimes use different names for the concept of parameterized cells e g t cell and magic cell in electronic circuit designs cells are basic units of functionality a given cell may be placed or instantiated many times a pcell is more flexible than a non parameterized cell because different instances may have different parameter values and therefore different structures for example rather than having many different cell definitions to represent the variously sized transistors in a given design a single pcell may take a transistor s dimensions width and length as parameters different instances of a single pcell can then represent transistors of different sizes but otherwise similar characteristics the structures within an integrated circuit and the rules design rules governing their physical dimensions are often complex thereby making the structures

it is a hemotoxin which acts as a serine protease similarly to thrombin and has been the subject of many medical studies as a replacement of thrombin different enzymes isolated from different species of bothrops have been called batroxobin but unless stated otherwise this article covers the batroxobin produced by b moojeni as this is the most studied variety bothrops atrox was described by carl linnaeus as early as 1758 but batroxobin the active compound in its venom was first described only in 1954 by h bruck and g salem in the years following this first description of batroxobin was shown to have several uses in surgery because of the increasing interest in the properties of batroxobin several studies on its hemostatic effect and coagulation have been published more recently in 1979 a german study showed the uses of batroxobin reptilase clot retraction test as a replacement test for the more commonly used thrombin time because the enzyme is unaffected by heparin it is mostly used when heparin is present in blood recent studies emphasize more on improving its uses in surgery mostly spinal surgery and the uses as serine protease batroxobin is a protein of the serine protease family

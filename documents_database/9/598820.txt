the two main aims of look ahead are to choose a variable to evaluate next and the order of values to assign to it in a general constraint satisfaction problem every variable can take a value in a domain a backtracking algorithm therefore iteratively chooses a variable and tests each of its possible values for each value the algorithm is recursively run look ahead is used to check the effects of choosing a given variable to evaluate or to decide the order of values to give to it the simpler technique for evaluating the effect of a specific assignment to a variable is called forward checking given the current partial solution and a candidate assignment to evaluate it checks whether another variable can take a consistent value in other words it first extends the current partial solution with the tentative value for the considered variable it then considers every other variable formula 1 that is still unassigned and checks whether there exists an evaluation of formula 1 that is consistent with the extended partial solution more generally forward checking determines the values for formula 1 that are consistent with the extended assignment a look ahead technique that may be more

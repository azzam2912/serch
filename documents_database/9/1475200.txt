the remaining 7 are referred to by their key or catalogue number chopin s composition of these mazurkas signaled new ideas of nationalism chopin based his mazurkas on the traditional polish folk dance also called the mazurka or mazur in polish however while he used the traditional mazurka as his model he was able to transform his mazurkas into an entirely new genre one that became known as a chopin genre chopin started composing his mazurkas in 1825 and continued composing them until 1849 the year of his death the number of mazurkas composed in each year varies but he was steadily writing them throughout this time period since chopin s mazurkas connect to the already established traditional polish mazurka some of the characteristics of the genre remain the same in his interpretation for example both the traditional mazurka and chopin s version contain a great deal of repetition this can mean repetition of a single measure or small group of measures repetition of a theme or even repetition of an entire section this repetition makes sense in the traditional dance for the repeat of a certain section of the actual dance even though chopin did not compose his mazurkas

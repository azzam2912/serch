print outs crt or lcd monitors and projectors all have a limited dynamic range that is inadequate to reproduce the full range of light intensities present in natural scenes tone mapping addresses the problem of strong contrast reduction from the scene radiance to the displayable range while preserving the image details and color appearance important to appreciate the original scene content the introduction of film based photography created issues since capturing the enormous dynamic range of lighting from the real world on a chemically limited negative was very difficult early film developers attempted to remedy this issue by designing the film stocks and the print development systems that gave a desired s shaped tone curve with slightly enhanced contrast about 15 in the middle range and gradually compressed highlights and shadows photographers have also used dodging and burning to overcome the limitations of the print process the advent of digital photography gave hope for better solutions to this problem one of the earliest algorithms employed by land and mccann in 1971 was retinex inspired by theories of lightness perception this method is inspired by the eye s biological mechanisms of adaptation when lighting conditions are an issue gamut mapping algorithms

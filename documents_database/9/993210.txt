the critical zone surface and near surface environment sustains nearly all terrestrial life the critical zone is an interdisciplinary field of research exploring the interactions among the land surface vegetation and water bodies and extends through the pedosphere unsaturated vadose zone and saturated groundwater zone critical zone science is the integration of earth surface processes such as landscape evolution weathering hydrology geochemistry and ecology at multiple spatial and temporal scales and across anthropogenic gradients these processes impact mass and energy exchange necessary for biomass productivity chemical cycling and water storage the critical zone is studied at critical zone observatories where multiple scientific communities study various aspects of the critical zone that can lead to synthesized understanding of complex systems tsakalotos first introduced the term critical zone in chemistry literature to describe the binary mixture of two fluids but has since been adopted to refer to the connection of vegetation to soil and weathered materials by gail ashley in october 2003 scientists attended the first weathering system science workshop participants agreed to promote outreach activities to broaden the profile of involved earth scientists and crafted a set of questions that would drive further development of weathering system science this field of

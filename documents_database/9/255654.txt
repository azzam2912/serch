tropical waves form in the easterly flow along the equatorward side of the subtropical ridge or belt of high air pressure which lies north and south of the intertropical convergence zone itcz tropical waves are generally carried westward by the prevailing easterly winds along the tropics and subtropics near the equator they can lead to the formation of tropical cyclones in the north atlantic and northeastern pacific basins a tropical wave study is aided by hovm ller diagrams a graph of meteorological data west moving waves can also form from the tail end of frontal zones in the subtropics and tropics and may be referred to as easterly waves but the waves are not properly called tropical waves they are a form of inverted trough that shares many characteristics of a tropical wave a tropical wave normally follows an area of sinking intensely dry air blowing from the northeast after the passage of the trough line the wind veers southeast the humidity abruptly rises and the atmosphere destabilizes this yields widespread showers and thunderstorms sometimes severe as the wave moves westward the showers gradually diminish an exception to this rain is in the atlantic sometimes a surge of dry air

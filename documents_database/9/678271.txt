a continuous truss bridge may use less material than a series of simple trusses because a continuous truss distributes live loads across all the spans in a series of simple trusses each truss must be capable of supporting the entire load although some continuous truss bridges resemble cantilever bridges and may be constructed using cantilever techniques there are important differences between the two forms cantilever bridges need not connect rigidly mid span as the cantilever arms are self supporting although some cantilever bridges appear continuous due to decorative trusswork at the joints these bridges will remain standing if the connections between the cantilevers are broken or if the suspended span if any is removed conversely continuous truss bridges rely on rigid truss connections throughout the structure for stability severing a continuous truss mid span endangers the structure however continuous truss bridges do not experience the tipping forces that a cantilever bridge must resist because the main span of a continuous truss bridge is supported at both ends it is possible to convert a series of simple truss spans into a continuous truss for example the northern approach to the golden gate bridge was originally constructed as a series of five

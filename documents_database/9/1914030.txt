specifically it is a way of projecting a stimulus onto a low dimensional subspace so that as much information as possible about the stimulus is preserved in the neural response it is motivated by the fact that natural stimuli are typically confined by their statistics to a lower dimensional space than that spanned by white noise within this subspace however stimulus response functions may be either linear or nonlinear the idea was originally developed by tatyana sharpee nicole rust and william bialek in 2003 neural stimulus response functions are typically given as the probability of a neuron generating an action potential or spike in response to a stimulus formula 1 the goal of maximally informative dimensions is to find a small relevant subspace of the much larger stimulus space that accurately captures the salient features of formula 1 let formula 3 denote the dimensionality of the entire stimulus space and formula 4 denote the dimensionality of the relevant subspace such that formula 5 we let formula 6 denote the basis of the relevant subspace and formula 7 the projection of formula 1 onto formula 9 using bayes theorem we can write out the probability of a spike given a stimulus

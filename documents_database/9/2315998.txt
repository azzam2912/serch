it will be one of thirteen cubesats to be carried with the artemis 1 mission into a heliocentric orbit in cislunar space on the maiden flight of the space launch system and the orion spacecraft scheduled to launch in 2019 the cu e team is pursuing four different cubequest prizes largest aggregate data volume most error free data blocks the most distant communications from earth and spacecraft longevity once deployed in the vicinity of the moon cu e will use a lunar gravity assist to propel itself into heliocentric orbit trailing the earth and slowly distancing itself over time by the end of its one year mission cu e is planned to be as far as 27 million kilometers from earth the spacecraft will use a commercial 6u cubesat satellite body bus called xb1 measuring about 10 20 30 cm the mass is about electric power will be provided by solar panels and stored in rechargeable lithium batteries the mission is focused upon advancing deep space cubesat communication techniques using an innovative reflective array antenna an x band transmitter for downlink and a c band transmitter for uplink the antenna array is planar meaning all of the elements are in

the instrument was invented in 1957 by leonard skeggs phd and commercialized by jack whitehead s technicon corporation the first applications were for clinical analysis but methods for industrial and environmental analysis soon followed the design is based on segmenting a continuously flowing stream with air bubbles continuous flow analysis cfa is a general term that encompasses both segmented flow analysis sfa and flow injection analysis fia in segmented flow analysis a continuous stream of material is divided by air bubbles into discrete segments in which chemical reactions occur the continuous stream of liquid samples and reagents are combined and transported in tubing and mixing coils the tubing passes the samples from one apparatus to the other with each apparatus performing different functions such as distillation dialysis extraction ion exchange heating incubation and subsequent recording of a signal an essential principle of sfa is the introduction of air bubbles the air bubbles segment each sample into discrete packets and act as a barrier between packets to prevent cross contamination as they travel down the length of the glass tubing the air bubbles also assist mixing by creating turbulent flow bolus flow and provide operators with a quick and easy check

more specifically suppose that formula 3 is an open set in the complex plane and formula 1 is a collection of paths in formula 3 and formula 6 is a conformal mapping then the extremal length of formula 1 is equal to the extremal length of the image of formula 1 under formula 9 one also works with the conformal modulus of formula 1 the reciprocal of the extremal length the fact that extremal length and conformal modulus are conformal invariants of formula 1 makes them useful tools in the study of conformal and quasi conformal mappings one also works with extremal length in dimensions greater than two and certain other metric spaces but the following deals primarily with the two dimensional setting to define extremal length we need to first introduce several related quantities let formula 3 be an open set in the complex plane suppose that formula 1 is a collection of rectifiable curves in formula 3 if formula 15 is borel measurable then for any rectifiable curve formula 16 we let denote the formula 18 length of formula 16 where formula 20 denotes the euclidean element of length it is possible that formula 21 what does this

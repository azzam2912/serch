the matrix relates the outputs of the system to its inputs it is a particularly useful construction for linear time invariant lti systems because it can be expressed in terms of the s plane in some systems especially ones consisting entirely of passive components it can be ambiguous which variables are inputs and which are outputs in electrical engineering a common scheme is to gather all the voltage variables on one side and all the current variables on the other regardless of which are inputs or outputs this results in all the elements of the transfer matrix being in units of impedance the concept of impedance and hence impedance matrices has been borrowed into other energy domains by analogy especially mechanics and acoustics many control systems span several different energy domains this requires transfer matrices with elements in mixed units this is needed both to describe transducers that make connections between domains and to describe the system as a whole if the matrix is to properly model energy flows in the system compatible variables must be chosen to allow this a mimo system with outputs and inputs is represented by a matrix each entry in the matrix is in the

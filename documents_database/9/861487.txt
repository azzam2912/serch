the theorem describes the properties of the support of the convolution of two functions e c titchmarsh proved the following theorem known as the titchmarsh convolution theorem in 1926 if formula 1 and formula 2 are integrable functions such that almost everywhere in the interval formula 4 then there exist formula 5 and formula 6 satisfying formula 7 such that formula 8 almost everywhere in formula 9 and formula 10 almost everywhere in formula 11 a corollary follows if the integral above is 0 for all formula 12 then either formula 13 or formula 14 is almost everywhere 0 in the interval formula 15 the theorem can be restated in the following form this theorem essentially states that the well known inclusion is sharp at the boundary the higher dimensional generalization in terms of the convex hull of the supports was proved by j l lions in 1951 above formula 22 denotes the convex hull of the set formula 23 denotes the space of distributions with compact support the theorem lacks an elementary proof the original proof by titchmarsh is based on the phragm n lindel f principle jensen s inequality the theorem of carleman and theorem of valiron more

the first one was used between 1924 and 1950 called the mongol internationale with words by sonombaljiryn buyannemekh and music by magsarjavyn dugarjav it is often incorrectly listed as the mongolian language version of the internationale despite the two songs having almost nothing in common aside from similar names the internationale does actually have a mongolian version however which should not be confused with the mongol internationale the second anthem by damdins ren and m rdorj replaced the mongol internationale and has been used since 1950 the lyrics were changed slightly in 1961 to include references to the mongolian people s revolutionary party and remove references to various soviet and mongolian leaders however the original lyrics were restored in the early 1991 following the election of a democratic government since 1991 most of the lyrics from 1950 are used again but the second verse praising lenin stalin s khbaatar and choibalsan has been removed on 6 july 2006 the lyrics were revised by the mongolian parliament to commemorate genghis khan the current constitution of mongolia mandates that the national anthem be broadcast daily on media channels prior to the end of transmissions

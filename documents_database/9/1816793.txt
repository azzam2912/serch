they were later named by alan schoen in his seminal report that described the gyroid and other triply periodic minimal surfaces the surfaces were generated using symmetry arguments given a solution to plateau s problem for a polygon reflections of the surface across the boundary lines also produce valid minimal surfaces that can be continuously joined to the original solution if a minimal surface meets a plane at right angles then the mirror image in the plane can also be joined to the surface hence given a suitable initial polygon inscribed in a unit cell periodic surfaces can be constructed the schwarz surfaces have topological genus 3 the minimal genus of triply periodic minimal surfaces they have been considered as models for periodic nanostructures in block copolymers electrostatic equipotential surfaces in crystals and hypothetical negatively curved graphite phases schoen named this surface primitive because it has two intertwined congruent labyrinths each with the shape of an inflated tubular version of the simple cubic lattice while the standard p surface has cubic symmetry the unit cell can be any rectangular box producing a family of minimal surfaces with the same topology it can be approximated by the implicit surface the p

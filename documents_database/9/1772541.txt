the name stochastic discount factor reflects the fact that the price of an asset can be computed by discounting the future cash flow formula 1 by the stochastic factor formula 2 and then taking the expectation this definition is of fundamental importance in asset pricing if there are n assets with initial prices formula 3 at the beginning of a period and payoffs formula 4 at the end of the period all x s are random variables then sdf is any random variable formula 2 satisfying the stochastic discount factor is sometimes referred to as the pricing kernel this name comes from the fact that if the expectation formula 7 is written as an integral then formula 2 can be interpreted as the kernel function in an integral transform other names for the sdf sometimes encountered are the marginal rate of substitution the ratio of utility of states when utility is separable and additive though discounted by the risk neutral rate a change of measure state price deflator or a state price density the existence of an sdf is equivalent to the law of one price similarly the existence of a strictly positive sdf is equivalent to the absence of

the accelerator held the world record in beam energy at the time of its construction and it still is the highest energy accelerator in russia in 1970 the u 70 scientists team was awarded the lenin prize for the development and commissioning of the synchrotron the complex operates in pulsed mode protons are accelerated to 30 mev by linear accelerator ural 30 then they are injected into the fast cyclic booster synchrotron u 1 5 having 100 m perimeter where protons are accelerated to 1 32 gev then the protons are injected to the u 70 after this an acceleration cycle takes place for 9 seconds when protons are accelerated to the maximum energy of 76 gev and then they are extracted from the ring to the secondary beams in the experimental halls u 70 has perimeter about 1 5 km focusing structure type is fodo strong focusing the total weight of the magnetic system of over 20 000 t the prior injection of u 70 was a 100 mev linear accelerator i 100 until 1985 a project for the unk accelerator storage complex a proton proton collider with an energy of 3 3 tev started in the mid 1980s

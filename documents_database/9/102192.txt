an l series is a dirichlet series usually convergent on a half plane that may give rise to an l function via analytic continuation the theory of l functions has become a very substantial and still largely conjectural part of contemporary analytic number theory in it broad generalisations of the riemann zeta function and the l series for a dirichlet character are constructed and their general properties in most cases still out of reach of proof are set out in a systematic way we distinguish at the outset between the l series an infinite series representation for example the dirichlet series for the riemann zeta function and the l function the function in the complex plane that is its analytic continuation the general constructions start with an l series defined first as a dirichlet series and then by an expansion as an euler product indexed by prime numbers estimates are required to prove that this converges in some right half plane of the complex numbers then one asks whether the function so defined can be analytically continued to the rest of the complex plane perhaps with some poles it is this conjectural meromorphic continuation to the complex plane which is

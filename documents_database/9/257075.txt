they are all gram positive actinomyces species are facultatively anaerobic except a meyeri and a israelii both obligate anaerobe and they grow best under anaerobic conditions actinomyces species may form endospores and while individual bacteria are rod shaped actinomyces colonies form fungus like branched networks of hyphae the aspect of these colonies initially led to the incorrect assumption that the organism was a fungus and to the name actinomyces ray fungus from greek ray beam and fungus actinomyces species are ubiquitous occurring in soil and in the microbiota of animals including the human microbiota they are known for the important role they play in soil ecology they produce a number of enzymes that help degrade organic plant material lignin and chitin thus their presence is important in the formation of compost certain species are commensal in the skin flora oral flora gut flora and vaginal flora of humans and livestock they are also known for causing diseases in humans and livestock usually when they get an opportunity to gain access to the body s interior through wounds as with other opportunistic infections people with immunodeficiency are at higher risk in all of the preceding traits and in their branching filament

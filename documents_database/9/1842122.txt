eiast s objective with dubaisat 2 is to provide electro optical images that can be commercialized for users within the united arab emirates and beyond and to develop and implement new technologies not used in dubaisat 1 eiast also intends to continue manpower training for the uae s space program 16 uae engineers have been working on the design development testing and manufacturing of the satellite the participation of the uae engineers who are currently working in south korea has increased by 100 per cent from the dubaisat 1 project the space segment consists of a spacecraft bus and an electro optical payload the electro optical payload is a push broom camera with time delay integration tdi sensors 1 panchromatic and 4 multi spectral bands dubaisat 2 is designed for a sun synchronous orbit of 600 km with a spatial resolution of 1m pan and 4m multispectral ms and a swath of 12 2 km the modules in the satellite use two can bus networks to communicate with each other and it has the capacity to store approximately 17 000 km of image data it also includes an experimental propulsion system for orbit correction and maintenance the satellite s expected

globular proteins are somewhat water soluble forming colloids in water unlike the fibrous or membrane proteins there are multiple fold classes of globular proteins since there are many different architectures that can fold into a roughly spherical shape the term globin can refer more specifically to proteins including the globin fold the term globular protein is quite old dating probably from the 19th century and is now somewhat archaic given the hundreds of thousands of proteins and more elegant and descriptive structural motif vocabulary the globular nature of these proteins can be determined without the means of modern techniques but only by using ultracentrifuges or dynamic light scattering techniques the spherical structure is induced by the protein s tertiary structure the molecule s apolar hydrophobic amino acids are bounded towards the molecule s interior whereas polar hydrophilic amino acids are bound outwards allowing dipole dipole interactions with the solvent which explains the molecule s solubility globular proteins are only marginally stable because the free energy released when the protein folded into its native conformation is relatively small this is because protein folding requires entropic cost as a primary sequence of a polypeptide chain can form numerous conformations native globular structure

fluxnet is a global network of regional networks that serves to provide an infrastructure to compile archive and distribute data for the scientific community it works to ensure that different flux networks are calibrated to facilitate comparison between sites and it provides a forum for the distribution of knowledge and data between scientists as of april 2014 there are over 683 tower sites in continuous long term operation researchers also collect data on site vegetation soil trace gas fluxes hydrology and meteorological characteristics at the tower sites according to the fluxnet website the goals of the project are as follows scientists have been measuring water vapor and carbon dioxide exchange between the earth s surface and the atmosphere since the late 1950s the relatively undeveloped computing capabilities and solid state measurement capabilities made it almost impossible to be able to get accurate measurements early scientists such as john monteith used the flux gradient method to make semi accurate assessments of the fluxes in a variety of natural settings the work of scientists such as monteith realized that the flux gradient method was not nearly as accurate as it needed to be when used to measure trace gas exchange in tall

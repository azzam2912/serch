ideally these radars would serve as research and observation platforms covering regions scarcely covered by the nexrad network as a whole one such concept later went on to become the doppler on wheels now a fleet of 3 operational vehicles in order to counteract the problems previously described with high frequency radars two decommissioned wsr 74 radars originally used for local warnings were acquired by tamu these two radars both operating in the c band are less susceptible to attenuation in precipitation and have overall greater ranges for doppler products throughout the rest of the 90s and into 2000 development of the first smart r sr 1 began during development a fire in the garage housing sr 1 broke out destroying the truck and several components much of the radar survived however and the project continued with the completion of sr 1 in late 2001 following this sr 2 was assembled and eventually completed in 2004 all listed characteristics will apply to both srs the operating maximum power for sr is 250 kw the highest operating frequency for sr is 5 635 mhz falling into the c band with a 2 5 m center fed parabolic antenna the gain is

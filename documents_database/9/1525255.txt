in human and animal anatomy three principal planes are used there could be any number of sagittal planes however there is only one cardinal sagittal plane the term cardinal refers to the one plane that divides the body into equal segments with exactly one half of the body on either side of the cardinal plane the term cardinal plane appears in some texts as the principal plane the terms are interchangeable the following terms are defined in reference to the anatomical model being in the upright orientation standing the axes and the sagittal plane are the same for bipeds and quadrupeds but the orientation of the coronal and transverse planes switch the axes on particular pieces of equipment may or may not correspond to axes of the body especially since the body and the equipment may be in different relative orientations when describing anatomical motion these planes describe the axis along which an action is performed so by moving through the transverse plane movement travels from head to toe for example if a person jumped directly up and then down their body would be moving through the transverse plane in the coronal and sagittal planes a longitudinal plane is any

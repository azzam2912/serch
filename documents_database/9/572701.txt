for two residues formula 1 and formula 2 the formula 3 element of the matrix is 1 if the two residues are closer than a predetermined threshold and 0 otherwise various contact definitions have been proposed the distance between the c c atom with threshold 6 12 distance between c c atoms with threshold 6 12 c is used for glycine and distance between the side chain centers of mass contact maps provide a more reduced representation of a protein structure than its full 3d atomic coordinates the advantage is that contact maps are invariant to rotations and translations they are more easily predicted by machine learning methods it has also been shown that under certain circumstances e g low content of erroneously predicted contacts it is possible to reconstruct the 3d coordinates of a protein using its contact map contact maps are also used for protein superimposition and to describe similarity between protein structures they are either predicted from protein sequence or calculated from a given structure with the availability of high numbers of genomic sequences it becomes feasible to analyze such sequences for coevolving residues the effectiveness of this approach results from the fact that a mutation in

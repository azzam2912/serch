the formula concerns only bremsstrahlung radiation not the element specific characteristic radiation it is named after its discoverer the dutch physicist hendrik anthony kramers the formula for kramers law is usually given as the distribution of intensity photon count formula 1 against the wavelength formula 2 of the emitted radiation the constant k is proportional to the atomic number of the target element and formula 4 is the minimum wavelength given by the duane hunt law the maximum intensity is formula 5 at formula 6 the intensity described above is a particle flux and not an energy flux as can be seen by the fact that the integral over values from formula 4 to formula 8 is infinite however the integral of the energy flux is finite to obtain a simple expression for the energy flux first change variables from formula 2 the wavelength to formula 10 the angular frequency using formula 11 and also using formula 12 now formula 13 is that quantity which is integrated over formula 10 from 0 to formula 15 to get the total number still infinite of photons where formula 16 the energy flux which we will call formula 18 but which may also

it is an object of research in computer graphics and is used in many fields amongst others digital image editing 3d computer graphics and post production of films texture synthesis can be used to fill in holes in images as in inpainting create large non repetitive background images and expand small pictures procedural textures are a related technique which may synthesise textures from scratch with no source material by contrast texture synthesis refers to techniques where some source image is being matched or extended texture is an ambiguous word and in the context of texture synthesis may have one of the following meanings texture can be arranged along a spectrum going from regular to stochastic connected by a smooth transition texture synthesis algorithms are intended to create an output image that meets the following requirements like most algorithms texture synthesis should be efficient in computation time and in memory use the following methods and algorithms have been researched or developed for texture synthesis the simplest way to generate a large image from a sample image is to tile it this means multiple copies of the sample are simply copied and pasted side by side the result is rarely satisfactory except

these transformations form a crucial link within ecosystems as they are responsible for liberating the energy stored in organic molecules and recycling matter within the system to be reused as nutrients by other organisms remineralization is normally viewed as it relates to the cycling of the major biologically important elements such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus while crucial to all ecosystems the process receives special consideration in aquatic settings where it forms a significant link in the biogeochemical dynamics and cycling of aquatic ecosystems the term remineralization is used in several contexts across different disciplines the term is most commonly used in the medicinal and physiological fields where it is describes the development or redevelopment of mineralized structures in organisms such as teeth or bone in the field of biogeochemistry however remineralization is used to describe a link in the chain of elemental cycling within a specific ecosystem in particular remineralization represents the point where organic material constructed by living organisms is broken down into basal inorganic components that are not obviously identifiable as having come from an organic source this differs from the process of decomposition which is a more general descriptor of larger structures degrading to smaller structures

microinverters contrast with conventional string and central solar inverters in which a single inverter is connected to multiple solar panels the output from several microinverters can be combined and often fed to the electrical grid microinverters have several advantages over conventional inverters the main advantage is that they electrically isolate the panels from each other so small amounts of shading debris or snow lines on any one solar module or even a complete module failure does not disproportionately reduce the output of the entire array each microinverter harvests optimum power by performing maximum power point tracking mppt for its connected module simplicity in system design lower amperage wires simplified stock management and added safety are other factors introduced with the microinverter solution the primary disadvantages of a microinverter include a higher initial equipment cost per peak watt than the equivalent power of a central inverter since each inverter needs to be installed adjacent to a panel usually on a roof this also makes them harder to maintain and more costly to remove and replace some manufacturers have addressed these issues with panels with built in microinverters a microinverter has often a longer lifespan than a central inverter which will need

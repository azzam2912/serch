since the crowd aimed to make as much noise as possible by beating on pots and pans or anything that came to hand these parades are often referred to as rough music parades were of three types in the first and generally most violent form a wrongdoer or wrongdoers might be dragged from their home or place of work and paraded by force through a community in the process they were subject to the derision of the crowd they might be pelted and frequently a victim or victims were dunked at the end of the proceedings a safer form involved a neighbour of the wrongdoer impersonating the victim whilst being carried through the streets the impersonator was obviously not himself punished and he often cried out or sang ribald verses mocking the wrongdoer in the common form an effigy was employed instead abused and often burnt at the end of the proceedings communities used rough music to express their disapproval of different types of violation of community norms for example they might target marriages of which they disapproved such as a union between an older widower and much younger woman or the too early remarriage by a widow or widower

the concept of self replicating machines has been advanced and examined by homer jacobson edward f moore freeman dyson john von neumann and in more recent times by k eric drexler in his book on nanotechnology engines of creation coining the term clanking replicator for such machines and by robert freitas and ralph merkle in their review kinematic self replicating machines which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator design space the future development of such technology is an integral part of several plans involving the mining of moons and asteroid belts for ore and other materials the creation of lunar factories and even the construction of solar power satellites in space the possibly misnamed von neumann probe is one theoretical example of such a machine von neumann also worked on what he called the universal constructor a self replicating machine that would operate in a cellular automata environment a self replicating machine is an artificial self replicating system that relies on conventional large scale technology and automation certain idiosyncratic terms are occasionally found in the literature for example the term clanking replicator was once used by drexler to distinguish macroscale replicating systems from the microscopic nanorobots or

like other feature detectors the hessian affine detector is typically used as a preprocessing step to algorithms that rely on identifiable characteristic interest points the hessian affine detector is part of the subclass of feature detectors known as affine invariant detectors harris affine region detector hessian affine regions maximally stable extremal regions kadir brady saliency detector edge based regions ebr and intensity extrema based ibr regions the hessian affine detector algorithm is almost identical to the harris affine region detector in fact both algorithms were derived by krystian mikolajczyk and cordelia schmid in 2002 based on earlier work in see also for a more general overview the harris affine detector relies on interest points detected at multiple scales using the harris corner measure on the second moment matrix the hessian affine also uses a multiple scale iterative algorithm to spatially localize and select scale and affine invariant points however at each individual scale the hessian affine detector chooses interest points based on the hessian matrix at that point formula 1 where formula 2 is second partial derivative in the formula 3 direction and formula 4 is the mixed partial second derivative in the formula 3 and formula 6 directions it

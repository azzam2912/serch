it is an important stage in the genesis of a civilization but historically appears to be an unstable threshold often reverting to tribal or chieftain cultures if unable to progress to a full blown and semi stable civilization examples of proto civilisations are found preceding the development of almost all civilisations but there are also examples of many proto civilisations that failed to generate a separate civilisation for example the la tene celtic culture of oppida stretching from such sites as at hueneburg in southern germany to the belgae kingdoms of southern britain show many of the characteristics of a proto civilisation including the settlement hierarchy already mentioned the development of an upper princely class having a monopoly on institutionalised violence the development of specialised functionaries artisans and craftspeople it is quite possible that this development would have led to a fully celtic civilisation if the areas had not been conquered by the romans and included as the western part of the roman empire the proto civilization sites have achieved much and made a big impact on today s society in north america the mississippian culture is believed to have produced proto civilizations at such sites as cahokia in illinois

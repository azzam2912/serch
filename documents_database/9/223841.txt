the known numbered earth crossers are listed here those earth crossers whose semi major axes are smaller than earth s are aten asteroids the remaining ones are apollo asteroids see also the amor asteroids an asteroid with an earth crossing orbit is not necessarily in danger of colliding with earth the orbit of an earth crossing asteroid may not even intersect with that of earth this apparent contradiction arises because many asteroids have highly inclined orbits so although they may have a perihelion less than that of earth their paths can never cross an asteroid for which there is some possibility of a collision with earth at a future date and which is above a certain size is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid pha specifically an asteroid is a pha if its earth minimum orbital intersection distance moid is au and its absolute magnitude is 22 or brighter the concept of pha is intended to replace the now abandoned strict definition of eca earth crossing asteroid which existed for a few years determining if an asteroid was an eca required calculation of its orbits millennia into the future including planetary gravitational perturbations to assess whether a collision with earth

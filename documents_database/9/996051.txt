the common symbols are j j q q or greek lower or capital phi sometimes with subscript m to indicate mass is the flowing quantity its si units are kg s m mass flux can also refer to an alternate form of flux in fick s law that includes the molecular mass or in darcy s law that includes the mass density unfortunately sometimes the defining equation for mass flux in this article is used interchangeably with the defining equation in mass flow rate for example fluid mechanics schaum s et al uses the definition of mass flux as the equation in the mass flow rate article mathematically mass flux is defined as the limit where is the mass current flow of mass m per unit time t and a is the area through which the mass flows through for mass flux as a vector j the surface integral it over a surface s followed by an integral over the time duration t to t gives the total amount of mass flowing through the surface in that time t t the area required to calculate the flux is real or imaginary flat or curved either as a cross sectional area

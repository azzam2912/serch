plasticisers extracted from plastic tubes mobile phase additives species which have not been removed from the sample matrix during sample preparation ion suppression is not strictly a problem unless interfering compounds elute at the same time as the analyte of interest in cases where ion suppressing species do co elute with an analyte the effects on the important analytical parameters including precision accuracy and limit of detection analytical sensitivity can be extensive severely limiting the validity of an assay s results at its inception as a tool of analytical chemistry lc ms ms spread rapidly and indeed continues to do so in amongst others bioanalytical fields owing to its selectivity for analytes of interest indeed in many cases this selectivity can lead to a misconception that it is always possible to simplify or on occasion almost completely remove the necessity for extensive sample preparation consequently lc ms ms has become the analytical tool of choice for bioanalysis owing to its impressive sensitivity and selectivity over other more conventional chromatographic approaches however during and after uptake by bioanalytical laboratories worldwide it became apparent that there were inherent problems with detection of relatively small analyte concentrations in the complex sample matrices associated

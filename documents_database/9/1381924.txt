unlike variables or parameters which represent a unit of state that resides in a single location distributed flows are dynamic and distributed they simultaneously appear in multiple locations within the network at the same time as such distributed flows are a more natural way of modeling the semantics and inner workings of certain classes of distributed systems in particular the distributed data flow abstraction has been used as a convenient way of expressing the high level logical relationships between parts of distributed protocols a distributed data flow satisfies the following informal properties formally we represent each event in a distributed flow as a quadruple of the form x t k v where x is the location e g the network address of a physical node at which the event occurs t is the time at which this happens k is a version or a sequence number identifying the particular event and v is a value that represents the event payload e g all the arguments passed in a method call each distributed flow is a possibly infinite set of such quadruples that satisfies the following three formal properties in addition to the above flows can have a number of additional

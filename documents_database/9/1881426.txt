molecular diffusion occurs in gases liquids and solids diffusion is a result of thermal motion of molecules usually convection occurs as a result of the diffusion process the rate at which diffusion occurs depends on the state of the molecules it occurs at a high rate in gases a slower rate in liquids and an even slower rate in solids in gases molecular diffusion is dependent on pressure and temperature the higher the pressure the slower the diffusion takes place and the higher the temperature the faster the diffusion takes place in liquids an increase in temperature increases the rate of diffusion however since liquids are incompressible the rate of diffusion is not affected by the pressure the rate of diffusion in solids is also increased by temperature heat and mass transfer occurs from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration a simplistic way to picture diffusion is when ink is put on a paper towel it spreads from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration the equation for this is shown below and is similar to the heat equation where however if a mixture is not of a pure concentration but consists of two species

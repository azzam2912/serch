additionally nprl3 has been shown to adjust cell metabolism via the tor pathway and this is important for development of the cardiovascular system in mammals without this effect spontaneous cell apoptosis would occur a similar function for nprl3 has been identified in the female reproductive system of drosophila during times of protein scarcity in homo sapiens the nprl3 gene is located at c16orf35 the gene is composed of 14 exons at 53 kbp in length this gene is highly conserved in vertebrates which is upstream from the alpha globin gene cluster within the fifth intron of the gene there is a regulatory section of dna hs 40 which regulates the expression of the alpha globin this means that the gene c16orf35 is expressed in early erythrocytes accompanying hemoglobin production the human nitrogen permease regulator like 3 protein has 569 amino acids there is a predicted n terminal longin domain within the nprl3 protein amino acids 4 168 at the c terminus there are three consecutive winged helix turn helix hth domains these regions are predicted bind to another macromolecule which could be dna rna or protein

it was invented in 1968 by bernard j eastlund and william c gough while they were program managers of the controlled thermonuclear research program of the united states atomic energy commission aec the basic concept was to impinge the plasma leaking from fusion reactors onto solids or liquids vaporizing dissociating and ionizing the materials then separating the resulting elements into separate bins for collection other applications of fusion plasmas such as generation of uv and optical light and generation of hydrogen fuel were also described in their associated 1969 paper the process began with a tokamak a doughnut shaped magnetic bottle containing plasma and unwanted material this combination would result in a pool of electrons and nuclei which in turn would cause the tokamak to overflow and transfer the plasma into an outlet this plasma then passes through a series of metal plates differing in particular temperatures all arranged in descending order the atoms of elements pass over the plates with boiling points above their own eventually the atoms encounter plates where the temperature is lower than their boiling point this makes them stick onto the plate the plates then work as a distillation system which sorts the plasma into

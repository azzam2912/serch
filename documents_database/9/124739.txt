in contrast to animals with radial symmetry whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells animals with bilateral symmetry have segregated defined nervous systems their neuroanatomy is therefore better understood in vertebrates the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the brain and spinal cord together called the central nervous system or cns and the routes of the nerves that connect to the rest of the body known as the peripheral nervous system or pns the delineation of distinct structures and regions of the nervous system has been critical in investigating how it works for example much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or lesions to specific brain areas affects behavior or other neural functions for information about the composition of non human animal nervous systems see nervous system for information about the typical structure of the homo sapiens nervous system see human brain or peripheral nervous system this article discusses information pertinent to the study of neuroanatomy the first known written record of a study of the anatomy of the human brain is an ancient egyptian document the edwin smith papyrus the next major development in neuroanatomy came from the greek

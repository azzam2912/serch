examples of this miniature art are also known from mongolia the subjects found on tsakli are similar to the better known larger tibetan thangka scroll paintings on cloth but much simpler usually showing only a single deity or a pair the subjects are usually deities or ritual objects and offerings associated with these deities are represented on the tsaklis occasionally tibetan inscriptions on the backside can identify the subjects which are painted on the front the tsakli which are normally painted in sets which can comprise from 6 to almost 100 small paintings of similar subjects are used as offerings in temples or in rituals for example before a temple building is started the area can be marked with tsakli representing protective deities in this case they are mounted on small wooden sticks similarly tsakli can be used by a buddhist lama to remove evil influences from a sick person from a tree which does not bear fruit or a stack of grain which is going to be thrashed a tsakli can also be placed in a portable shrine or box tibetan gau and carried as a device giving protection to the traveller or pilgrim who carries this box around

these enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses one of which utilizes nad as the electron acceptor and the other nadp five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported three nad dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases which localize to the mitochondrial matrix and two nadp dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic nad dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases catalyze the allosterically regulated rate limiting step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle each isozyme is a heterotetramer that is composed of two alpha subunits one beta subunit and one gamma subunit the protein encoded by this gene is the alpha subunit of one isozyme of nad dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase provided by refseq jul 2008 idh3 is one of three isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes the other two being idh1 and idh2 and encoded by one of five isocitrate dehydrogenase genes which are idh1 idh2 idh3a idh3b and idh3g the genes idh3a idh3b and idh3g encode subunits of idh3 which is a heterotetramer composed of two 37 kda subunits idh3 one 39 kda subunit idh3 and one 39 kda subunit idh3 each with distinct isoelectric points alignment of their amino acid sequences reveals 40 identity between idh3 and idh3 42 identity between idh3 and idh3 and

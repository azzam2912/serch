it has n nodes v 0 1 n 1 and the set of edges e i j i j v given a node i we can define its set of neighbors in g by s j v i j e let us also consider a scalar field h h h defined on the set of nodes v so that every node i has a scalar value h associated to it gradient h on a network hformula 1 i i i e the directed edge from i to i where i s i and h has the maximum value in formula 2 gradient network formula 3 formula 4 formula 5 where f is the set of gradient edges on g in general the scalar field depends on time due to the flow external sources and sinks on the network therefore the gradient network formula 4 will be dynamic real world networks evolve to fulfill a main function which is often to transport entities such as information cars power water etc all these large scale networks mentioned above are non globally designed they evolve and grow through local changes through a natural selection like dynamics for example if a router on the

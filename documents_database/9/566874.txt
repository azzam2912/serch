this porphyrin is the precursor to hemoglobin the oxygen carrier in animals and chlorophyll the dye in plants the enzyme catalyzes the dehydrogenation removal of hydrogen atoms of protoporphyrinogen ix the product of the sixth step in the production of heme to form protoporphyrin ix one additional enzyme must modify protoporphyrin ix before it becomes heme inhibition of this enzyme is a strategy used in certain herbicides the ppox gene is located on the long q arm of chromosome 1 at position 22 from base pair 157 949 266 to base pair 157 954 082 this gene encodes the penultimate enzyme of heme biosynthesis which catalyzes the 6 electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen ix to form protoporphyrin ix this protein is a flavoprotein associated with the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane the following genes encode enzymes that catalyze the various steps in the heme biosynthetic pathway variegate porphyria is caused by mutations in the ppox gene more than 100 mutations that can cause variegate porphyria have been identified in the ppox gene one mutation a substitution of the amino acid tryptophan for arginine at position 59 also written as arg59trp or r59w is found in about 95 percent of

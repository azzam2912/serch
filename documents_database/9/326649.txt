each feature is located by either a point e g a signpost or a line e g a no passing zone if a segment of the linear element or route is changed only those locations on the changed segment need to be updated linear referencing is suitable for management of data related to linear features like roads railways oil and gas transmission pipelines power and data transmission lines and rivers a system for identifying the location of pipeline features and characteristics is by measuring distance from the start of the pipeline an example linear reference address is engineering station 1145 86 on pipeline alpha 114 586 feet from the start of the pipeline with a reroute cumulative stationing might not be the same as engineering stationing because of the addition of the extra pipeline linear referencing systems compute the differences to resolve this dilemma linear referencing is one of a family of methods of expressing location coordinates such as latitude and longitude are another member of the family as are landmark references such as 5 km south of ayers rock linear referencing has traditionally been the expression of choice in engineering applications such as road and pipeline maintenance one can

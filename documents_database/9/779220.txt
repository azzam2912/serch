mosquitoes are best known as parasites to many vertebrate animals and vectors for disease they are holometabolous insects and most species lay their eggs in stagnant water to benefit their aquatic larval stage the subfamily culicinae is the largest subfamily of culicidae a family of nematocera dipterans there are 3 046 species of culicinae mosquitoes in 108 genera and 11 tribes members of the culicinae subfamily are small flies with fore wings for flight and hind wings reduced to halteres for balance the mosquitoes also have long slender legs and proboscis style mouth parts for feeding on vertebrate blood or plant fluids only the females are blood feeders requiring a high quality protein meal before they can oviposit because the mosquitoes are well adapted for finding hosts the females can move quickly from one blood meal to another and when injecting their saliva can inject pathogens picked up from other hosts and thus efficiently spread disease culicinae mosquitoes are holometabolous going through four distinct life stages egg larva pupa and adult the duration of each stage is species specific but all culicinae mosquitoes are multivoltine the egg larval and pupal stages are aquatic adults leave the water by flight to

mse is a risk function corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss the fact that mse is almost always strictly positive and not zero is because of randomness or because the estimator does not account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate the mse is a measure of the quality of an estimator it is always non negative and values closer to zero are better the mse is the second moment about the origin of the error and thus incorporates both the variance of the estimator how widely spread the estimates are from one data sample to another and its bias how far off the average estimated value is from the truth for an unbiased estimator the mse is the variance of the estimator like the variance mse has the same units of measurement as the square of the quantity being estimated in an analogy to standard deviation taking the square root of mse yields the root mean square error or root mean square deviation rmse or rmsd which has the same units as the quantity being estimated for an unbiased estimator the rmse is the square root of the variance known as the standard

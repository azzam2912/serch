specific focal points of study include the rates of organic reactions the relative chemical stabilities of the starting materials reactive intermediates transition states and products of chemical reactions and non covalent aspects of solvation and molecular interactions that influence chemical reactivity such studies provide theoretical and practical frameworks to understand how changes in structure in solution or solid state contexts impact reaction mechanism and rate for each organic reaction of interest physical organic chemists use theoretical and experimental approaches work to understand these foundational problems in organic chemistry including classical and statistical thermodynamic calculations quantum mechanical theory and computational chemistry as well as experimental spectroscopy e g nmr spectrometry e g ms and crystallography approaches the field therefore has applications to a wide variety of more specialized fields including electro and photochemistry polymer and supramolecular chemistry and bioorganic chemistry enzymology and chemical biology as well as to commercial enterprises involving process chemistry chemical engineering materials science and nanotechnology and pharmacology in drug discovery by design physical organic chemistry is the study of the relationship between structure and reactivity of organic molecules more specifically physical organic chemistry applies the experimental tools of physical chemistry to the study of the structure of

for this reason fractal antennas are very compact multiband or wideband and have useful applications in cellular telephone and microwave communications a fractal antenna s response differs markedly from traditional antenna designs in that it is capable of operating with good to excellent performance at many different frequencies simultaneously normally standard antennas have to be cut for the frequency for which they are to be used and thus the standard antennas only work well at that frequency this makes the fractal antenna an excellent choice for wideband and multiband applications in addition the fractal nature of the antenna shrinks its size without the use of any components such as inductors or capacitors the first fractal antennas were in fact fractal arrays with fractal arrangements of antenna elements and not recognized initially as having self similarity as their attribute log periodic antennas are arrays around since the 1950s invented by isbell and duhamel that are such fractal arrays they are a common form used in tv antennas and are arrow head in shape antenna elements as opposed to antenna arrays made from self similar shapes were first created by nathan cohen then a professor at boston university starting in 1988 cohen

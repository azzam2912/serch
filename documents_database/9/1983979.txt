european rolling stock tend to use buffers and chain couplers while american rolling stock uses a janney coupler or knuckle coupler these are incompatible with each other but where some railroads have obtained older less expensive used rolling stock from different countries or regions instead of having to standardize on one form of coupler it may be useful to be able to use either type of coupler on a piece of rolling stock without having to remove anything it is possible to mount both buffers and chain and knuckle couplers on the same car provided that one can swing out of the way alternatively either a lug to hold the chain is cast in the body of the coupler or a chain is mounted on top of the coupler this is also done with an sa3 coupler built by sab wabco locomotives and some freight cars of the indian railways are fitted with a transition coupler that incorporates a screw coupling within a knuckle coupler the knuckle coupler remains in position and does not swing away when not in use the screw coupling is mounted on a hinge on the opposite side of the knuckle coupler most indian freight cars

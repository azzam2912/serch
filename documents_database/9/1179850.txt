the device embodies the first example of polyalphabetic substitution with mixed alphabets and variable period and is made up of two concentric disks attached by a common pin which can rotate one with respect to the other the larger one is called stabilis stationary or fixed the smaller one is called mobilis movable the circumference of each disk is divided into 24 equal cells the outer ring contains one uppercase alphabet for plaintext and the inner ring has a lowercase mixed alphabet for ciphertext the outer ring also includes the numbers 1 to 4 for the superencipherment of a codebook containing 336 phrases with assigned numerical values this is a very effective method of concealing the code numbers since their equivalents cannot be distinguished from the other garbled letters the sliding of the alphabets is controlled by key letters included in the body of the cryptogram a translation of alberti s description is given under alberti cipher a lowercase letter on the smaller ring is used as an index in this example the letter g in the inner ring is chosen as an index and is moved under an uppercase letter in this case a of the stationary ring the

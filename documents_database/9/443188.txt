the gynoecium is the innermost whorl of a flower it consists of one or more pistils and is typically surrounded by the pollen producing reproductive organs the stamens collectively called the androecium the gynoecium is often referred to as the female portion of the flower although rather than directly producing female gametes i e egg cells the gynoecium produces megaspores each of which develops into a female gametophyte which then produces egg cells the term gynoecium is also used by botanists to refer to a cluster of archegonia and any associated modified leaves or stems present on a gametophyte shoot in mosses liverworts and hornworts the corresponding terms for the male parts of those plants are clusters of antheridia within the androecium flowers that bear a gynoecium but no stamens are called pistillate or carpellate flowers lacking a gynoecium are called staminate the gynoecium is often referred to as female because it gives rise to female egg producing gametophytes however strictly speaking sporophytes do not have a sex only gametophytes do gynoecium development and arrangement is important in systematic research and identification of angiosperms but can be the most challenging of the floral parts to interpret the gynoecium may consist

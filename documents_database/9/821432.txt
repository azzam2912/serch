interictal spect scans the goal of ictal spect is to localize the region of seizure onset for epilepsy surgery planning isas was introduced and validated in two recent studies chang et al 2002 mcnally et al 2005 this site is a technical supplement to mcnally et al 2005 which should enable isas to be implemented at any center for further study and analysis the basic idea of isas is to compute the difference between an ictal and interictal spect scan for a single patient the differences of the ictal inter ictal comparison are checked against a healthy normal database to determine the normal expected variation significant increases and decreases in cbf cerebral blood flow between the interictal and ictal spect can then be detected the analysis is conducted using spm statistical parametric mapping cerebral blood flow is known to increase during seizures at the site of seizure onset since spect is an indicator of cbf increases in the spect during seizures can be useful for seizure localization cbf decreases are more complicated and occur both during and following seizures in multiple locations details of isas interpretation can be found in mcnally et al 2005 but in summary 1 for true

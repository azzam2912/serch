iverson and roger hui is a synthesis of apl also by iverson and the fp and fl function level languages created by john backus to avoid repeating the apl special character problem j uses only the basic ascii character set resorting to the use of the dot and colon as inflections to form short words similar to digraphs most such primary or primitive j words serve as mathematical symbols with the dot or colon extending the meaning of the basic characters available also many characters which in other languages often must be paired such as codice 1 or codice 2 are treated by j as stand alone words or when inflected as single character roots of multi character words j is a very terse array programming language and is most suited to mathematical and statistical programming especially when performing operations on matrices it has also been used in extreme programming and network performance analysis like the original fp fl languages j supports function level programming via its tacit programming features unlike most languages that support object oriented programming j s flexible hierarchical namespace scheme where every name exists in a specific locale can be effectively used as a framework for

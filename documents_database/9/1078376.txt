it is used in many motion control industrial equipment aerospace and automotive applications model based design is a methodology applied in designing embedded software model based design provides an efficient approach for establishing a common framework for communication throughout the design process while supporting the development cycle v model in model based design of control systems development is manifested in these four steps the model based design is significantly different from traditional design methodology rather than using complex structures and extensive software code designers can use model based design to define plant models with advanced functional characteristics using continuous time and discrete time building blocks these built models used with simulation tools can lead to rapid prototyping software testing and verification not only is the testing and verification process enhanced but also in some cases hardware in the loop simulation can be used with the new design paradigm to perform testing of dynamic effects on the system more quickly and much more efficiently than with traditional design methodology the dawn of the electrical age brought many innovative and advanced control systems as early as the 1920s two aspects of engineering control theory and control systems converged to make large scale

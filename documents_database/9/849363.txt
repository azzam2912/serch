this egg features a clock and is a design that faberg copied for his duchess of marlborough egg in 1902 most faberg scholarship published prior to 2008 assigned the egg s creation to 1887 although with some notable reservations due to inconsistencies between the blue serpent clock egg and contemporary descriptions of the 1887 egg the 2012 rediscovery of the 1887 third imperial egg announced to the world in march 2014 validates the theory that the blue serpent clock was crafted and delivered in 1895 to the then tsar of russia nicholas ii it is currently owned by prince albert ii and is held in monaco the crafting of this imperial egg is credited to michael perkhin of faberg s shop the egg stands on a base of gold that is painted in opalescent white enamel the three panels of the base feature motifs of raised gold in four colors representing the arts and sciences a serpent set with diamonds coils around the stand connecting the base to the egg and up toward its center the serpent s head and tongue point to the hour which is indicated in roman numerals on a white band that runs around the egg

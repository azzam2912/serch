rozella was circumscribed by french mycologist marie maxime cornu in 1872 considered one of the earliest diverging lineages of fungi the widespread genus contains 27 species with the most well studied being rozella allomycis rozella is a member of a large clade of fungi referred to as the cryptomycota rozellomycota while some can be maintained in dual culture with the host most have not been cultured but they have been detected using molecular techniques in soil samples and in freshwater and marine ecosystems zoospores have been observed along with cysts and the cells of some species are attached to diatoms rozella species grow inside their hosts at first the thallus is unwalled and indistinguishable from the host as growth continues the thallus will either form a zoosporangium using the wall of the host or a thick walled resting spore that can be smooth or spiny from its conception there have been two divergent morphologies within the genus monosporangiate species form a single zoosporangium within the host polysporangiate species form multiple zoosporangia that are separated with septa most described species are parasites of oomycota chytridiomycota and blastocladiomycota rozella itersoniliae is a parasite of the basidiomycete itersonilia perplexans though some authors doubt

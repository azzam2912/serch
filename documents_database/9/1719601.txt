for instance as shown in the illustration in any tiling of the plane by identical squares some two squares must meet edge to edge this conjecture was introduced by after whom it is named it was shown to be true in dimensions at most 6 by however for higher dimensions it is false as was shown in dimensions at least 10 by and in dimensions at least 8 by these disproofs used a reformulation of the problem in terms of the clique number of certain graphs now known as keller graphs although this graph theoretic version of the conjecture is now resolved for all dimensions keller s original cube tiling conjecture remains open in dimension 7 a solution to the remaining 7 dimensional case has been announced by the related minkowski lattice cube tiling conjecture states that whenever a tiling of space by identical cubes has the additional property that the cube centers form a lattice some cubes must meet face to face it was proved by gy rgy haj s in 1942 and give surveys of work on keller s conjecture and related problems a family of closed sets called tiles forms a tessellation or tiling of a euclidean

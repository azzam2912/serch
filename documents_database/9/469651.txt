the term chlorogenic acids refers to a related polyphenol family of esters including hydroxycinnamic acids caffeic acid ferulic acid and p coumaric acid with quinic acid despite the chloro of the name chlorogenic acids contain no chlorine instead the name comes from the greek light green and a suffix meaning giving rise to pertaining to the green color produced when chlorogenic acids are oxidized structurally chlorogenic acid is the ester formed between caffeic acid and the 3 hydroxyl of quinic acid isomers of chlorogenic acid include the caffeoyl ester at other hydroxyl sites on the quinic acid ring 4 o caffeoylquinic acid cryptochlorogenic acid or 4 cqa and 5 o caffeoylquinic acid neochlorogenic acid or 5 cqa the epimer at position 1 has not yet been reported structures having more than one caffeic acid group are called isochlorogenic acids and can be found in coffee there are several isomers such as 3 4 dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3 5 dicaffeoylquinic acid and cynarine 1 5 dicaffeoylquinic acid the biosynthetic precursor to chlorogenic acid is 4 coumaroyl coa containing a single hydroxyl group on the aryl ring which in turn is produced from cinnamic acid the hydroxylation of the coumaryl ester i

in the complete form four left sided defects are present of these four defects supravalvular mitral membrane svmm is the first to occur and triggers the development of the other three defects partial complexes or forme fruste have also been described the definition is often expanded to include lesions of the left side of the heart not originally ascribed to shone s syndrome including mitral and aortic valvular lesions and supravalvular aortic stenosis the term parachute mitral valve stems from the morphological appearance of the valve that is to say the mitral valve leaflets appear as the canopy of the parachute the chordae as the strings and the papillary muscle as the harness as discussed earlier shone s syndrome is a rare disorder that is often detected in very young children the children tend to show symptoms like fatigue nocturnal cough and reduced cardiac output by the age of two years they also develop wheezing due to the exudation of fluid into the lungs as in the normal human heart there exists two mitral valve leaflets each with their own set of chordae unique to the parachute mitral valve is that the chordae insert on one papillary muscle rather than

there are two closely related concepts of semidirect product as with direct products there is a natural equivalence between inner and outer semidirect products and both are commonly referred to simply as semidirect products for finite groups the schur zassenhaus theorem provides a sufficient condition for the existence of a decomposition as a semidirect product a k a splitting extension given a group with identity element a subgroup and a normal subgroup then the following statements are equivalent of groups which is also known as group extension of formula 2 by formula 3 if any of these statements holds and hence all of them hold by their equivalence we say is the semidirect product of and written or that splits over one also says that is a semidirect product of acting on or even a semidirect product of and to avoid ambiguity it is advisable to specify which is the normal subgroup to introduce the notion of outer semidirect products let us first consider to inner semidirect product in this case for a group formula 5 consider it normal subgroup and the subgroup not necessarily normal let denote the group of all automorphisms of which is a group under the

all test units in the facility are owned by the united states air force and currently operated by national aerospace solutions the sl2 and sl3 cells are approximately 24 feet in height and width and 60 feet in length in addition to running ambient pressure inlet conditions they also provide the capability of using one of the complex s air plants to supply inlet pressures above ambient thus allowing testing at up to mach 1 2 inlet temperature capability extends from ambient to 120 degree fahrenheit when running in the atmospheric inlet mode and from 20 to 270 degrees fahrenheit in pressurized mode both cells can accommodate engines that produce up to 70 000 pounds of thrust in recent years sl 2 has tested the f100 engine for the f 15 eagle f 16 fighting falcon and the f119 engine for the f 22a raptor sl 3 has also tested the pratt whitney f100 engine as well as the pratt whitney f135 engine for the f 35

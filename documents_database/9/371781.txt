bots are used in a variety of video game genres for a variety of tasks a bot written for a first person shooter fps works very differently from one written for a massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg the former may include analysis of the map and even basic strategy the latter may be used to automate a repetitive and tedious task like farming bots written for first person shooters usually try to mimic how a human would play a game computer controlled bots may play against other bots and or human players in unison either over the internet on a lan or in a local session features and intelligence of bots may vary greatly especially with community created content advanced bots feature machine learning for dynamic learning of patterns of the opponent as well as dynamic learning of previously unknown maps whereas more trivial bots may rely completely on lists of waypoints created for each map by the developer limiting the bot to play only maps with said waypoints using bots is generally against the rules of current massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs but a significant number of players still use mmorpg bots for games like

the technology was developed by studying different natural storage facilities such as the natural reactor in oklo gabon and the uranium mine in cigar lake saskatchewan canada the general theory is that radioactive rock in these sites has been present for thousands of years and has not affected the health and well being of human populations kbs 3 is also to be used in finland at the onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository being built by posiva the disposal method consists of the following steps if the holes into the rock from the cave are drilled vertically the method is called kbs 3v and if they are drilled horizontally it is called kbs 3h the only method considered so far is kbs 3v the overall theory is that radioactive rock has always been present in the earth and it is generally harmless to human populations further cigar lake and oklo have proven that actinides do not easily migrate via ground water or other means spent fuel consists of radioactive ceramic cooled until its short half life radioactives have decayed so its heat production is negligible when initially made the ceramic fuel is also wrapped in sealed tubes of corrosion resistant zirconium

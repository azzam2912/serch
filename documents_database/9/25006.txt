the principle is named after daniel bernoulli who published it in his book hydrodynamica in 1738 although bernoulli deduced that pressure decreases when the flow speed increases it was leonhard euler who derived bernoulli s equation in its usual form in 1752 the principle is only applicable for isentropic flows when the effects of irreversible processes like turbulence and non adiabatic processes e g heat radiation are small and can be neglected bernoulli s principle can be applied to various types of fluid flow resulting in various forms of bernoulli s equation there are different forms of bernoulli s equation for different types of flow the simple form of bernoulli s equation is valid for incompressible flows e g most liquid flows and gases moving at low mach number more advanced forms may be applied to compressible flows at higher mach numbers see the derivations of the bernoulli equation bernoulli s principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy this states that in a steady flow the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid along a streamline is the same at all points on that streamline this requires that the sum of kinetic energy potential

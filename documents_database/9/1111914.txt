until 2011 chicken anemia virus was the only gyrovirus identified but since then gyroviruses have also been identified in humans diseases associated with this genus include chicken infectious anemia which is associated with depletion of cortical thymocytes and erythroblastoid cells group ssdna gyroviruses have an average size of 19 to 27 nanometers they are nonenveloped and have an icosahedral capsid with t 1 symmetry the unique single protein trumpet shaped capsomeres of gyrovirus are arranged into 12 pentomers yielding a capsid 60 units in size the genome is circular non segmented and 2290 2320 nucleotides long the gyrovirus genome consists of negative sense single stranded circular dna the genome is relatively small at 2 300 nucleotides and contains three overlapping open reading frames that code for only three known proteins the gyrovirus genome codes for a single polysistronic mrna that subsequently codes for three proteins vp1 vp2 and vp3 vp1 is the 51kd capsid protein in addition to its structural function it also contains motifs for rolling circle replication in the c terminal region vp2 is a 23kd nonstructural protein with phosphatase activity virions with mutations in sp2 are still replication competent however their cytopathic effects were highly attenuated vp3

angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in euclidean and other spaces these are called dihedral angles angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection similar statements hold in space for example the spherical angle formed by two great circles on a sphere is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles angle is also used to designate the measure of an angle or of a rotation this measure is the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius in the case of a geometric angle the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides in the case of a rotation the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation the word angle comes from the latin word angulus meaning corner cognate words are the greek ankyl s meaning crooked curved and the english word ankle both are connected with the proto indo european root ank meaning to bend or bow euclid defines a plane angle as

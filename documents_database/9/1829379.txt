it is a faint star but visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4 52 measurements with the hipparcos spacecraft showed an annual parallax shift of 41 37 mas which provides a distance estimate of 79 light years it is moving closer to the sun with a radial velocity of 2 km s eta indi appears to be a member of the octans association which is a group of 62 stars that are around 30 50 million years old and following a common motion through space the spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of a9 iv which suggests it is an evolving subgiant star of type a in 2017 it was found to be a possible hybrid delta scuti gamma doradus variable the star has an estimated 1 6 times the mass of the sun and 2 27 times the sun s radius it is shines with 7 60 times the sun s luminosity which is radiated from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 7 694 k the star is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 75 km s

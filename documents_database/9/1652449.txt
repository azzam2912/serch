the biopreservation of food especially utilizing lactic acid bacteria lab that are inhibitory to food spoilage microbes has been practiced since early ages at first unconsciously but eventually with an increasingly robust scientific foundation beneficial bacteria or the fermentation products produced by these bacteria are used in biopreservation to control spoilage and render pathogens inactive in food there are a various modes of action through which microorganisms can interfere with the growth of others such as organic acid production resulting in a reduction of ph and the antimicrobial activity of the un dissociated acid molecules a wide variety of small inhibitory molecules including hydrogen peroxide etc it is a benign ecological approach which is gaining increasing attention of special interest are lactic acid bacteria lab lactic acid bacteria have antagonistic properties which make them particularly useful as biopreservatives when labs compete for nutrients their metabolites often include active antimicrobials such as lactic and acetic acid hydrogen peroxide and peptide bacteriocins some labs produce the antimicrobial nisin which is a particularly effective preservative these days lab bacteriocins are used as an integral part of hurdle technology using them in combination with other preservative techniques can effectively control spoilage bacteria and other

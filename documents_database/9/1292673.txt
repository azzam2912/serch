after the discovery of the neutron in 1932 models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by dmitri ivanenko and werner heisenberg an atom is composed of a positively charged nucleus with a cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding it bound together by electrostatic force almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus with a very small contribution from the electron cloud protons and neutrons are bound together to form a nucleus by the nuclear force the diameter of the nucleus is in the range of for hydrogen the diameter of a single proton to about for the heaviest atom uranium these dimensions are much smaller than the diameter of the atom itself nucleus electron cloud by a factor of about 26 634 uranium atomic radius is about to about 60 250 hydrogen atomic radius is about the branch of physics concerned with the study and understanding of the atomic nucleus including its composition and the forces which bind it together is called nuclear physics the nucleus was discovered in 1911 as a result of ernest rutherford s efforts to test thomson s plum pudding model of the atom the electron

on 15 june 2016 the ligo and virgo collaborations announced that they had verified the signal making it the second such signal confirmed after gw150914 which had been announced four months earlier the same year and the third gravitational wave signal detected the signal was detected by ligo at 03 38 53 utc with the hanford detector picking it up 1 1 milliseconds after the livingston detector since the axis between the two was not parallel to the wave front it was identified by a low latency search within 70s of its arrival at the detectors analysis indicated the signal resulted from the coalescence of two black holes with and times the mass of the sun at a distance of megaparsecs 1 4 billion light years from earth the resulting merged black hole had solar masses one solar mass having been radiated away in both of the first two black hole mergers analyzed the mass converted to gravitational waves was roughly 4 6 of the initial total in this second detection ligo scientific collaboration and virgo scientists also determined that at least one of the premerger black holes was spinning at more than 20 of the maximum spin rate allowed

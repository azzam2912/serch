the extreme metal album examines a number of antisemitic concepts and incidents throughout history in his review for allmusic thom jurek notes that black shabbis is not for everybody not even some saft fans necessarily but it is a powerful excellent work that uses the metal genre well expertly even and will convince headbangers of its essential importance as one of the voices out there that stands tall and defiant in the face of much of the anti semitism that is promoted by some black and death metal bands for everyone else it is an angry howl of both pain and resistance whose anger is carried beautifully as the artist s ultimate weapon his imagination and creativity to provoke to give pause and reflection metal reviews stated black shabbis takes in a range of styles and taking into account the previous works of its creator it s difficult to know whether black shabbis is a serious attempt at making a metal record or more a pastiche of the genre as a whole black shabbis has some good ideas but it s an awkward bitty album saft clearly has talent but he s effectively crippled by a weird overly dry production

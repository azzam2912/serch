it is a type of soft tissue sarcoma the name synovial sarcoma was coined early in the 20th century as some researchers thought that the microscopic similarity of some tumors to synovium and its propensity to arise adjacent to joints indicated a synovial origin however the actual cells from which the tumor develops are unknown and not necessarily synovial primary synovial sarcomas are most common in the soft tissue near the large joints of the arm and leg but have been documented in most human tissues and organs including the brain prostate and heart synovial sarcoma occurs in about 1 2 per 1 000 000 people a year they occur most commonly in the third decade of life with males being affected more often than females ratio around 1 2 1 synovial sarcoma usually presents with an otherwise asymptomatic swelling or mass although general symptoms related to malignancies can be reported such as fatigue the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is typically made based on histology and is confirmed by the presence of t x 18 chromosomal translocation two cell types can be seen microscopically in synovial sarcoma one fibrous type known as a spindle or sarcomatous cell is relatively small

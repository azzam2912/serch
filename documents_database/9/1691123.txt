it is based on rodrigues rotation formula but uses a different parametrization the rotation is described by four euler parameters due to leonhard euler the rodrigues formula named after olinde rodrigues a method of calculating the position of a rotated point is used in some software applications such as flight simulators and computer games a rotation about the origin is represented by four real numbers such that when the rotation is applied a point at position rotates to its new position the parameter may be called the scalar parameter while the vector parameter in standard vector notation the rodrigues rotation formula takes the compact form the parameters and describe the same rotation apart from this symmetry every set of four parameters describes a unique rotation in three dimensional space the composition of two rotations is itself a rotation let and be the euler parameters of two rotations the parameters for the compound rotation rotation 2 after rotation 1 are as follows it is straightforward though tedious to check that this is essentially euler s four square identity also used by rodrigues any central rotation in three dimensions is uniquely determined by its axis of rotation represented by a unit vector

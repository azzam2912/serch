wilhelm ostwald developed the process and he patented it in 1902 the ostwald process is a mainstay of the modern chemical industry and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production historically and practically the ostwald process is closely associated with the haber process which provides the requisite raw material ammonia nh ammonia is converted to nitric acid in 2 stages it is oxidized by heating with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum with 10 rhodium platinum metal on fused silica wool copper or nickel to form nitric oxide nitrogen ii oxide and water as steam this reaction is strongly exothermic making it a useful heat source once initiated stage two encompasses two reactions and is carried out in an absorption apparatus containing water initially nitric oxide is oxidized again to yield nitrogen dioxide nitrogen iv oxide this gas is then readily absorbed by the water yielding the desired product nitric acid albeit in a dilute form while reducing a portion of it back to nitric oxide the no is recycled and the acid is concentrated to the required strength by distillation alternatively if the last step is carried out

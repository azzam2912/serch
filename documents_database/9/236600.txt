this page explains the theory behind what these tools set out to measure and the issues regarding these measurements reasons for measuring throughput in networks people are often concerned about measuring the maximum data throughput in bits per second of a communications link or network access a typical method of performing a measurement is to transfer a large file from one system to another system and measure the time required to complete the transfer or copy of the file the throughput is then calculated by dividing the file size by the time to get the throughput in megabits kilobits or bits per second unfortunately the results of such an exercise will often result in the goodput which is less than the maximum theoretical data throughput leading to people believing that their communications link is not operating correctly in fact there are many overheads accounted for in throughput in addition to transmission overheads including latency tcp receive window size and system limitations which means the calculated goodput does not reflect the maximum achievable throughput the maximum bandwidth can be calculated as follows formula 1 where rwin is the tcp receive window and rtt is the round trip time for the path

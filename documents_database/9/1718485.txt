the hox gene contains four clusters a b c and d the sense strand of the hoxa gene codes for proteins alternative names for hoxa11 as lncrna are hoxa as5 hoxa11s hoxa11 as1 hoxa11as or ncrna00076 this gene is 3 885 nucleotides long and resides at chromosome 7 7p15 2 and is transcribed from an independent gene promoter being a lncrna it is longer than 200 nucleotides in length in contrast to regular non coding rnas the hox genes code for transcription factors that are key to embryonic development this lncrna is one of the three lncrnas present in the 5 prime region of the hoxa11 gene the other two lncrnas are hoxa10 as and hottip of these lncrnas hoxa11 as is the most conserved sequence in a wide range of organisms which shows its longevity in the phylogenetic tree since hox genes play a prominent role in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis genes on the sense strand and antisense non coding rna ncrna genes are often studied in their role of aberrant epithelial differentiation and cancer development many lncrnas are sequences that regulate the expression of nearby or distant genes common in hox genes lncrnas can either regulate through cis or

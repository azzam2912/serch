it contains an amino group which is in the protonated nh form under biological conditions an carboxylic acid group which is in the deprotonated coo form under biological conditions and a side chain lysyl ch nh classifying it as a basic charged at physiological ph aliphatic amino acid it is encoded by the codons aaa and aag like almost all other amino acids the carbon is chiral and lysine may refer to either enantiomer or a racemic mixture of both for the purpose of this article lysine will refer to the biologically active enantiomer l lysine where the carbon is in the s configuration the human body cannot synthesize lysine so it is essential in humans and must be obtained from the diet in organisms that synthesise lysine it has two main biosynthetic pathways the diaminopimelate and aminoadipate pathways which employ different enzymes and substrates and are found in different organisms lysine catabolism occurs through one of several pathways the most common of which is the saccharopine pathway lysine plays several roles in humans most importantly proteinogenesis but also in the crosslinking of collagen polypeptides uptake of essential mineral nutrients and in the production of carnitine which is key in

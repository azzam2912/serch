mise will examine europa s surface composition and relate it to the habitability of its internal water ocean since nasa s voyager mission flew past europa in 1979 scientists have worked to understand the composition of the reddish brown material known as tholin that coats fractures and other geologically youthful features on europa s surface material from the ocean is probably being transported to the surface by active processes in the interior at the surface the material is exposed to the effects of vacuum temperature irradiated by solar uv and bombarded by material entrained in jupiter s magnetic field causing photolysis and radiolysis and the transformation and generation of new organic compounds the compounds at the surface are likely recycled back into the ocean below visible to short wavelength infrared vswir spectroscopy is a well understood technique for mapping from orbit key inorganic organic and volatile compositions on planetary surfaces mise was selected for the europa clipper mission in may 2015 and it is built by the jpl in collaboration with the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory apl the instrument s principal investigator is diana blaney a primary goal of the mise instrument is to determine if europa is

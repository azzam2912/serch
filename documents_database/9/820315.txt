the oxidation state of the oxygen in hypofluorites is 0 it is also the only hypohalous acid that can be isolated as a solid hof is an intermediate in the oxidation of water by fluorine which produces hydrogen fluoride oxygen difluoride hydrogen peroxide ozone and oxygen hof is explosive at room temperature forming hf and o it was isolated in the pure form by passing f gas over ice at 40 c collecting the hof gas and condensing it the compound has been characterized in the solid phase by x ray crystallography as a bent molecule with an angle of 101 the o f and o h bond lengths are 144 2 and 96 4 picometres respectively the solid framework consists of chains with o h o linkages the structure has also been analyzed in the gas phase a state in which the h o f bond angle is slightly narrower 97 2 hypofluorous acid in acetonitrile generated in situ by passing gaseous fluorine through wet acetonitrile is commonly known as rozen s reagent hypofluorites are formally derivatives of of which is the conjugate base of hypofluorous acid one example is trifluoromethyl hypofluorite cfof

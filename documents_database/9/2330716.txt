pc is most commonly seen in abdominopelvic malignancies computed tomography ct is particularly important for detailed preoperative assessment and evaluation of the radiological peritoneal cancer index pci the imaging findings vary from simple ascites to multifocal discrete nodules and infiltrative peritoneal masses various tumours and tumour like conditions can mimic pc a systematic analysis of ct imaging features is helpful to narrow down the differential diagnosis staging and effectively guiding the patient management the peritoneum is a mesothelial lining covering the abdominal cavity parietal peritoneum and intraperitoneal organs visceral peritoneum peritoneal cavity contains a small amount of fluid which circulates under the influence of negative pressure generated by the diaphragm gravity and bowel peristalsis this natural flow pattern determines the route of spread of disease processes within the peritoneal cavity peritoneal carcinomatosis pc is defined as intraperitoneal dissemination of any tumor which is not originated from the peritoneum itself pc is one of the most common diffuse peritoneal diseases peritoneal carcinomatosis without distant metastases represents locoregional disease and has the potential for aggressive locoregional treatment most ct scan findings are however nonspecific as both neoplastic and non neoplastic pathologies of the peritoneum present as soft tissue masses with or without

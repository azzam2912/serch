a firewall usually blocks incoming connections on open ports but does not block outgoing traffic in a normal forward connection a client connects to a server through the server s open port but in the case of a reverse connection the client opens the port that the server connects to the most common way a reverse connection is used is to bypass firewall and router security restrictions for example a backdoor running on a computer behind a firewall that blocks incoming connections can easily open an outbound connection to a remote host on the internet once the connection is established the remote host can send commands to the backdoor remote administration tools rat that use a reverse connection usually send syn packets to the client s ip address the client listens for these syn packets and accepts the desired connections if a computer is sending syn packets or is connected to the client s computer the connections can be discovered by using the netstat command or a common port listener like active ports if the internet connection is closed down and an application still tries to connect to remote hosts it may be infected with malware keyloggers and other malicious

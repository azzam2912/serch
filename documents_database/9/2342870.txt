it is terrestrial growing from tubers to a height of up to 30 cm with pinkish flowers arranged in a one sided spike it was placed in several different genera before a study in 2014 showed that it belonged in an expanded ponerorchis ponerorchis cucullata grows from more or less ellipsoid tubers it reaches a height of around 10 30 cm it has two basal leaves 5 7 cm long by 1 5 3 cm wide one or two smaller bract like leaves occur further up the stem the pinkish flowers are arranged in a one sided spike the lip or labellum is 7 9 mm long and is deeply divided into three lobes the middle lobe being the longest the sepals and lateral petals are about 1 mm shorter than the labellum and together form a hood a spur is present about 6 mm long slightly expanded at the tip the viscidia are not enclosed in a sac or bursicle the species was first described by carl linnaeus in 1753 as orchis cucullata it was subsequently transferred to a number of genera including gymnadenia and habenaria before being placed in neottianthe in 1919 a molecular phylogenetic study in 2014

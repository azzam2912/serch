it is an 8 bit pointer in a program chain pgc to a group of cells the basic units of video playback dvd programs define the order in which cells are played back and will reflect user selections for playback for instance multi angle scenes can be shown through a branch in the program chain as the dvd is being played to the video cells for the other angles subtitles as well are also sometimes run through branches in program chains because the order in which cells are to be played is not necessarily the order in which the cells are found on the disc this is especially true for commercially produced dvds programs are required for intelligible playback at the consumer level however dvds created by most authoring tools are simpler and have only one program per chapter some commercial dvds may have a large number of program chains which point to the same set of cells which may confuse some ripping software into believing that the disc has more than 9 gigabytes of data remote buttons next and previous navigate programs another example of a program chain is the first play pgc when a disc is first inserted

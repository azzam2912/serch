in industrial applications the liquid and vapor streams can have co current or countercurrent flows stripping is usually carried out in either a packed or trayed column stripping works on the basis of mass transfer the idea is to make the conditions favorable for the component a in the liquid phase to transfer to the vapor phase this involves a gas liquid interface that a must cross the total amount of a that has moved across this boundary can be defined as the flux of a n stripping is mainly conducted in trayed towers plate columns and packed columns and less often in spray towers bubble columns and centrifugal contactors trayed towers consist of a vertical column with liquid flowing in the top and out the bottom the vapor phase enters in the bottom of the column and exits out of the top inside of the column are trays or plates these trays force the liquid to flow back and forth horizontally while the vapor bubbles up through holes in the trays the purpose of these trays is to increase the amount of contact area between the liquid and vapor phases packed columns are similar to trayed columns in that

the hall is now owned by the town and is known as astley hall museum and art gallery the extensive landscaped grounds are now chorley s astley park the site was acquired in the 15th century by the charnock family from the knights of st john of jerusalem the charnocks built the original timber framed house around a small courtyard about 1575 1600 in 1665 margaret charnock married richard brooke of mere in cheshire son of sir peter brooke and they built the present grand but asymmetrical front range of brick with a pair of vast mullion and transomed bay windows this front has a doorway with distinctly rustic ionic columns remarkable at such a late date the interior is notable for the staggering mid 17th century plasterwork in the ceilings of the great hall and drawing room which have heavy wreaths and disporting cherubs the ceilings are barbaric in their excesses and the figures are relatively poorly modelled although the undercutting is breathtaking not all the moulding is of stucco there are elements of lead and leather too the staircase is of the same period with a coarse but vigorously carved acanthus scroll balustrade and square newels with vases

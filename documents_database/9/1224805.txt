a naive application of newtonian gravity can yield exactly half this value where the light ray is assumed as a massed particle and scattered by the gravitational potential well this approximation is good when formula 3 is small in situations where general relativity can be approximated by linearized gravity the deflection due to a spatially extended mass can be written simply as a vector sum over point masses in the continuum limit this becomes an integral over the density formula 4 and if the deflection is small we can approximate the gravitational potential along the deflected trajectory by the potential along the undeflected trajectory as in the born approximation in quantum mechanics the deflection is then formula 5 the amplification matrix can be obtained by double derivatives of the dimensionless time delay formula 6 where we have define the derivatives formula 7 which takes the meaning of convergence and shear the amplification is the inverse of the jacobian formula 8 where a positive a means either a maxima or a minima and a negative a means a saddle point in the arrival surface for a single point lens one can show albeit a lengthy calculation that formula 9 so the

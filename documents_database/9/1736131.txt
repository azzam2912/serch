under the beas project the dam was completed in 1977 and its primary purpose is hydroelectric power generation part of a run of the river power scheme it diverts the waters of the beas to the southwest through a long system of tunnels and channels the water is used for power generation at the dehar power house before being discharged into the sutlej river connecting both rivers the power house has an installed capacity of 990 mw the system diverts 256 cumecs 9000 cusecs of beas waters to the satluj river the project was completed in 1977 the two major rivers beas and satluj flow out of the himalayas and reach a point where they are separated by a crow fly distance of approximately 36 km and have an elevation difference of approximately 1099 ft the waters of beas are continuous flow from ice melt and flow throughout the year this was realized and a plan made to exploit the potential of this river system the power potential was estimated as 1 000 mw the plans originally called beas project unit i beas satluj link project went through several revisions for diverting the waters of beas river the first plan

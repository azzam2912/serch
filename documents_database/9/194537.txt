several notable types of smart devices are smartphones smart cars smart thermostats smart doorbells smart locks smart refrigerators phablets and tablets smartwatches smart bands smart key chains smart speakers and others the term can also refer to a device that exhibits some properties of ubiquitous computing including although not necessarily artificial intelligence smart devices can be designed to support a variety of form factors a range of properties pertaining to ubiquitous computing and to be used in three main system environments physical world human centered environments and distributed computing environments in 1991 mark weiser proposed three basic forms for ubiquitous system devices tabs pads and boards these three forms proposed by weiser are characterised by being macro sized having a planar form and by incorporating visual output displays these were also envisioned more as information appliances if we relax each of these three characteristics we can expand this range into a much more diverse and potentially more useful range of ubiquitous computing devices hence three additional forms for ubiquitous systems have been proposed smart devices are typically composed of a hardware layer including a radio that transmits signals a network layer through which devices communicate with each other and an

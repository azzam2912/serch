pabpc4 or ipabp inducible pabp was isolated as an activation induced t cell mrna encoding a protein activation of t cells increased pabpc4 mrna levels in t cells approximately 5 fold pabpc4 contains 4 rna binding domains and proline rich c terminus pabpc4 is localized primarily to the cytoplasm it is suggested that pabpc4 might be necessary for regulation of stability of labile mrna species in activated t cells pabpc4 was also identified as an antigen app1 activated platelet protein 1 expressed on thrombin activated rabbit platelets pabpc4 may also be involved in the regulation of protein translation in platelets and megakaryocytes or may participate in the binding or stabilization of polyadenylates in platelet dense granules model organisms have been used in the study of pabpc4 function a conditional knockout mouse line called pabpc4 was generated as part of the international knockout mouse consortium program a high throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion twenty tests were carried out on mutant mice and one significant abnormality was observed female homozygous mutants displayed impaired glucose tolerance pabpc4 has been

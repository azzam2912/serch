cil instructions are executed by a cli compatible runtime environment such as the common language runtime languages which target the cli compile to cil cil is object oriented stack based bytecode runtimes typically just in time compile cil instructions into native code cil was originally known as microsoft intermediate language msil during the beta releases of the net languages due to standardization of c and the common language infrastructure the bytecode is now officially known as cil during compilation of cli programming languages the source code is translated into cil code rather than into platform or processor specific object code cil is a cpu and platform independent instruction set that can be executed in any environment supporting the common language infrastructure such as the net runtime on windows or the cross platform mono runtime in theory this eliminates the need to distribute different executable files for different platforms and cpu types cil code is verified for safety during runtime providing better security and reliability than natively compiled executable files the execution process looks like this cil bytecode has instructions for the following groups of tasks the common intermediate language is object oriented and stack based that means that data is

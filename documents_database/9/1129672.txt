t box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes this gene is closely linked to related family member t box 3 ulnar mammary syndrome on human chromosome 12 tbx5 is a gene that is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 tbx5 produces a protein called t box 5 that acts as a transcription factor the tbx5 gene is involved with forelimb and heart development this gene impacts the early development of the forelimb by triggering fibroblast growth factor fgf10 tbx5 is involved with the development of the four chambers in the heart the electrical conducting system and the septum separating the right and left sides of the heart the encoded protein may play a role in heart development and specification of limb identity mutations in this gene have been associated with holt oram syndrome a developmental disorder affecting the heart and upper limbs skeletally there may be abnormally bent fingers sloping shoulders and phocomelia cardiac defects include ventral and atrial septation and problems with the conduction system several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene in studies done in mutant mice without the tbx5 gene it has been shown that

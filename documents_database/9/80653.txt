a directed cycle in a directed graph is a non empty directed trail in which the only repeated are the first and last vertices a graph without cycles is called an acyclic graph a directed graph without directed cycles is called a directed acyclic graph a connected graph without cycles is called a tree a chordless cycle in a graph also called a hole or an induced cycle is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle an antihole is the complement of a graph hole chordless cycles may be used to characterize perfect graphs by the strong perfect graph theorem a graph is perfect if and only if none of its holes or antiholes have an odd number of vertices that is greater than three a chordal graph a special type of perfect graph has no holes of any size greater than three the girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle this cycle is necessarily chordless cages are defined as the smallest regular graphs with given combinations of degree and girth a peripheral cycle is a cycle in a graph

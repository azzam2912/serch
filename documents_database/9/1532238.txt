only five units were built all delivered by valmet in 1955 the maybach diesel engines used in the locomotives proved highly unreliable resulting in a complete overhaul of the engine transmission system in 1956 58 but this did not solve all of the reliability problems the hr11 series was withdrawn from service in 1972 vr finnish railways started a modernization project in the early fifties vr had a small amount of diesel and gasoline powered railcars since the 1920s but in 1952 vr had only steam locomotives modern aluminum carriage diesel powered express multiple units dm3 and dm4 were introduced in 1952 related to these orders vr ordered in 1952 five passenger train diesel locomotives with hydraulic transmission from valmet oy tampere the locomotives were delivered in 1955 the locomotives had originally two six cylinder maybach md320 diesel engines driving each their own maybach mekydro k64b hydraulic mechanical gearbox the engines and transmission were placed in the bogies the engine transmission units proved to be very unreliable and in 1956 58 a complete overhaul was done among other improvements the engines were fitted with turbochargers which increased the power from 450 hp to 600 hp but simultaneously lowered the rpm

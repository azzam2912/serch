functional regression models can be classified into four types depending on whether the responses or covariates are functional or scalar i scalar responses with functional covariates ii functional responses with scalar covariates iii functional responses with functional covariates and iv scalar or functional responses with functional and scalar covariates in addition functional regression models can be linear partially linear or nonlinear in particular functional polynomial models functional single and multiple index models and functional additive models are three special cases of functional nonlinear models functional linear models flms are an extension of linear models lms a linear model with scalar response formula 1 and scalar covariates formula 2 can be written as where formula 3 denotes the inner product in euclidean space formula 4 and formula 5 denote the regression coefficients and formula 6 is a random error with mean zero and finite variance flms can be divided into two types based on the responses functional linear models with scalar responses can be obtained by replacing the scalar covariates formula 7 and the coefficient vector formula 8 in model by a centered functional covariate formula 9 and a coefficient function formula 10 with domain formula 11 respectively and replacing the

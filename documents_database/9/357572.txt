they were introduced by the group theorist a hall divisor of an integer n is a divisor d of n such that d and n d are coprime the easiest way to find the hall divisors is to write the prime factorization for the number in question and take any product of the multiplicative terms the full power of any of the prime factors including 0 of them for a product of 1 or all of them for a product equal to the original number for example to find the hall divisors of 60 show the prime factorization is 2 3 5 and take any product of 3 4 5 thus the hall divisors of 60 are 1 3 4 5 12 15 20 and 60 a hall subgroup of g is a subgroup whose order is a hall divisor of the order of g in other words it is a subgroup whose order is coprime to its index if is a set of primes then a hall subgroup is a subgroup whose order is a product of primes in and whose index is not divisible by any primes in proved that if g is a finite solvable group and

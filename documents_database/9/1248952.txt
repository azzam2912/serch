one of its uses is in text mining for search engines it was introduced by avrim blum and tom mitchell in 1998 co training is a semi supervised learning technique that requires two views of the data it assumes that each example is described using two different feature sets that provide different complementary information about the instance ideally the two views are conditionally independent i e the two feature sets of each instance are conditionally independent given the class and each view is sufficient i e the class of an instance can be accurately predicted from each view alone co training first learns a separate classifier for each view using any labeled examples the most confident predictions of each classifier on the unlabeled data are then used to iteratively construct additional labeled training data the original co training paper described experiments using co training to classify web pages into academic course home page or not the classifier correctly categorized 95 of 788 web pages with only 12 labeled web pages as examples the paper has been cited over 1000 times and received the 10 years best paper award at the 25th international conference on machine learning icml 2008 a renowned

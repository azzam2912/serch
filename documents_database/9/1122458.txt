it is a colourless liquid with a strong fruity odor which is used as precursor to components in perfumes and lubricants the formation of heptanal in the fractional distillation of castor oil was already described in 1878 the large scale production is based on the pyrolytic cleavage of ricinoleic acid ester arkema method and on the hydroformylation of 1 hexene with rhodium 2 ethylhexanoate as a catalyst upon addition of some 2 ethylhexanoic acid oxea method heptanal naturally occurs in the essential oils of ylang ylang cananga odorata clary sage salvia sclarea lemon citrus x limon bitter orange citrus x aurantium rose rosa and hyacinth hyacinthus heptanal is a flammable slightly volatile colorless liquid of pervasive fruity to oily greasy odor which is miscible with alcohols and practically insoluble in water because of its sensitivity to oxidation heptanal is filled under nitrogen and stabilized with 100 ppm hydroquinone heptanal forms flammable vapor air mixtures the compound has a flash point of 39 5 c the explosion range is between 1 1 by volume as the lower explosion limit lel and 5 2 by volume as the upper explosion limit its ignition temperature is 205 c heptanal can be used for

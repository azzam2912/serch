in 1867 he received a doctoral degree in medicine at leipzig from 1870 he taught physiology at the university of utrecht becoming a professor in 1877 in 1897 he began teaching physiology at the university of berlin where he also became the editor of the archiv f r anatomie und physiologie he retired in 1908 but continued to serve as editor until his death engelmann s major contribution to the field of physiology emerged from a study lasting from 1873 to 1897 in which he observed the contractions of striated muscles focusing on the visible bands of fibers in the muscles he noted that the volume of the anisotropic band increased during contraction whereas the volume of the isotropic band decreased he theorized that it was this interaction between the two bands which allowed for muscle contraction he also demonstrated after experiments with dissected frogs in 1875 that contractions of the heart were caused by the heart muscle itself not an external nerve stimulus as was previously believed engelmann performed three significant experiments involving photosynthesis in 1881 he observed the movement of bacteria towards the chloroplasts in a strand of spirogyra algae engelmann hypothesized that the bacteria were moving in

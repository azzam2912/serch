the geology of the moth locality consists of fine alternating laminae of light grey argillaceous limestone or calcareous shale and dark grey silt to sand rich calcareous shale as observed in thin section and the characterization of the lithology for the vertebrate bearing strata as an interlaminated argillaceous limestone and calcareous shale the abundance of cryptic trace fossils and the presence of pyrite suggest that the intra shelf topographic sag at moth had restricted circulation and was generally hypoxic zorn et al 2005 the moth locality 62 32 n 127 45 w is located in the central mackenzie mountains approximately 70 km northeast of tungsten northwest territories canada hanke 2008 the moth locality was named after a pile of rocks resembling a human sitting on a ridge man on the hill adrain wilson 1994 the locality is on the southwest limb of the grizzly bear anticline in rocks which are thought to be transitional between the road river formation and the delorme group adrain wilson 1994 gabrielse et al 1973 provided the original description of the structural geology lithological features and associated invertebrate and vertebrate fossils in the measured section at moth the marine rocks preserved in the mackenzie mountains

in particular it emphasizes the separation of prokaryotes into two groups originally called eubacteria now bacteria and archaebacteria now archaea woese argued that on the basis of differences in 16s rrna genes these two groups and the eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly developed genetic machinery often called a progenote to reflect these primary lines of descent he treated each as a domain divided into several different kingdoms woese initially used the term kingdom to refer to the three primary phylogenic groupings and this nomenclature was widely used until the term domain was adopted in 1990 parts of the three domain theory have been challenged by scientists such as radhey gupta who argues that the primary division within prokaryotes should be between those surrounded by a single membrane and those with two membranes the three domain system adds a level of classification the domains above the kingdoms present in the previously used five or six kingdom systems this classification system recognizes the fundamental divide between the two prokaryotic groups insofar as archaea appear to be more closely related to eukaryotes than they are to other prokaryotes bacteria like organisms with no cell nucleus the current system sorts

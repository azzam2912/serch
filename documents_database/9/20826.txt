the term refers specifically to magnetometers used by military forces to detect submarines a mass of ferromagnetic material creates a detectable disturbance in the magnetic field military mad equipment is a descendant of geomagnetic survey or aeromagnetic survey instruments used to search for minerals by detecting their disturbance of the normal earth field geoexploration by measuring and studying variations in the earth s magnetic field has been conducted by scientists since 1843 the first uses of magnetometers were for the location of ore deposits thalen s the examination of iron ore deposits by magnetic measurements published in 1879 was the first scientific treatise describing this practical use magnetic anomaly detectors employed to detect submarines during world war ii harnessed the fluxgate magnetometer an inexpensive and easy to use technology developed in the 1930s by victor vacquier of gulf oil for finding ore deposits mad gear was used by both japanese and u s anti submarine forces either towed by ship or mounted in aircraft to detect shallow submerged enemy submarines the japanese called the technology jikitanchiki magnetic detector after the war the u s navy continued to develop mad gear as a parallel development with sonar detection technologies satellite near

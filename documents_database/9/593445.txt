the magnitude and direction of slip are represented by the burgers vector the picture on the right shows a schematic view of the slip mechanism the slip planes and slip directions in a crystal have specific crystallographic forms the slip planes are normally the planes with the highest density of atoms i e those most closely spaced and the direction of the slip is the direction in the slip plane that corresponds to one of the shortest lattice translation vectors often this is the direction in which atoms are most closely spaced a slip plane and a slip direction constitute a slip system a critical resolved shear stress is required to initiate a slip slip is an important mode of deformation mechanism in crystals for metals and technically used metallic alloys it is by far the most important deformation mechanism and subject to current research in materials science slip in face centered cubic fcc crystals occurs along the close packed plane specifically the slip plane is of type 111 and the direction is of type in the diagram on the right the specific plane and direction are 111 and 10 respectively given the permutations of the slip plane types and

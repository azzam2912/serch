it has been implicated in ifn il 6 il 10 and il 12 signaling this gene encodes a member of the tyrosine kinase and to be more specific the janus kinases jaks protein families this protein associates with the cytoplasmic domain of type i and type ii cytokine receptors and promulgate cytokine signals by phosphorylating receptor subunits it is also component of both the type i and type iii interferon signaling pathways as such it may play a role in anti viral immunity cytokines play pivotal roles in immunity and inflammation by regulating the survival proliferation differentiation and function of immune cells as well as cells from other organ systems hence targeting cytokines and their receptors is an effective means of treating such disorders type i and ii cytokine receptors associate with janus family kinases jaks to affect intracellular signaling cytokines including interleukins interferons and hemopoietins activate the janus kinases which associate with their cognate receptors the mammalian jak family has four members jak1 jak2 jak3 and tyrosine kinase 2 tyk2 the connection between jaks and cytokine signaling was first revealed when a screen for genes involved in interferon type i ifn 1 signaling identified tyk2 as an essential element

they are a subset of all ethernet physical layers early ethernet had used various grades of coaxial cable but in 1984 starlan showed the potential of simple unshielded twisted pair this led to the development of 10base t and its successors 100base tx 1000base t and 10gbase t supporting speeds of 10 100 mbit s and 1 and 10 gbit s respectively all these standards use 8p8c connectors while the cables range from cat 3 to cat 8 the first two early designs of twisted pair networking were starlan standardized by the ieee standards association as ieee 802 3e in 1986 at one megabit per second and lattisnet developed in january 1987 at 10 megabit per second both were developed before the 10base t standard published in 1990 as ieee 802 3i and used different signalling so they were not directly compatible with it in 1988 at t released starlan 10 named for working at 10 mbit s the starlan 10 signalling was used as the basis of 10base t with the addition of link beat to quickly indicate connection status using twisted pair cabling in a star topology for ethernet addressed several weaknesses of the previous standards although 10base

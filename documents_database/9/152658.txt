they have a wide host range including vertebrates invertebrates plants protists and fungi they are unique in that they lack lipid envelopes and package their genomes of discrete double stranded segments of rna within multi layered capsids lack of a lipid envelope has allowed three dimensional structures of these large complex viruses diameter 60 100 nm to be obtained there are currently 87 species in this family divided among 30 genera reoviruses can affect the gastrointestinal system such as rotavirus and respiratory tract the name reo is derived from respiratory enteric orphan viruses the term orphan virus refers to the fact that some of these viruses have been observed not associated with any known disease even though viruses in the family reoviridae have more recently been identified with various diseases the original name is still used reovirus infection occurs often in humans but most cases are mild or subclinical rotavirus however can cause severe diarrhea and intestinal distress in children and lab studies in mice have implicated orthoreovirus in the expression of coeliac disease in pre disposed individuals the virus can be readily detected in feces and may also be recovered from pharyngeal or nasal secretions urine cerebrospinal fluid and

michael faraday described this phenomenon as the beautiful flash of light attending the discharge of common electricity the rapid transition from a non conducting to a conductive state produces a brief emission of light and a sharp crack or snapping sound a spark is created when the applied electric field exceeds the dielectric breakdown strength of the intervening medium for air the breakdown strength is about 30 kv cm at sea level experimentally this figure tends to differ depending upon humidity atmospheric pressure shape of electrodes needle and ground plane hemispherical etc and the corresponding spacing between them and even the type of waveform whether sinusoidal or cosine rectangular at the beginning stages free electrons in the gap from cosmic rays or background radiation are accelerated by the electrical field as they collide with air molecules they create additional ions and newly freed electrons which are also accelerated at some point thermal energy will provide a much greater source of ions the exponentially increasing electrons and ions rapidly cause regions of the air in the gap to become electrically conductive in a process called dielectric breakdown once the gap breaks down current flow is limited by the available charge for

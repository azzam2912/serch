ichnology is the study of such traces and is the work of ichnologists trace fossils may consist of impressions made on or in the substrate by an organism for example burrows borings bioerosion urolites erosion caused by evacuation of liquid wastes footprints and feeding marks and root cavities the term in its broadest sense also includes the remains of other organic material produced by an organism for example coprolites fossilized droppings or chemical markers or sedimentological structures produced by biological means for example stromatolites trace fossils contrast with body fossils which are the fossilized remains of parts of organisms bodies usually altered by later chemical activity or mineralization sedimentary structures for example those produced by empty shells rolling along the sea floor are not produced through the behaviour of an organism and not considered trace fossils the study of traces ichnology divides into paleoichnology or the study of trace fossils and neoichnology the study of modern traces ichnological science offers many challenges as most traces reflect the behaviour not the biological affinity of their makers accordingly researchers classify trace fossils into form genera based on their appearance and on the implied behaviour or ethology of their makers traces are better

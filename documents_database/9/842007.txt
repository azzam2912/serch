it is the modification of the analog write signal shifting transitions somewhat in time in such a way as to ensure that the signal that will later be read back will be as close as possible to the unmodified write signal it is required because of the non linear properties of magnetic recording surfaces a higher amount of precompensation is needed to write data in sectors that are closer to the center of the disk in constant angular velocity cav recording in which the disk spins at a constant speed no matter where the data is written the sectors closest to the spindle are packed tighter than the outer sectors and so require a slightly different timing to write the data in the most reliable way cav recording is used by most floppy disk systems and by older hard disk systems the term cav is not applicable to non circular media such as magnetic tapes on magnetic tapes precompensation is usually constant throughout the tape in the past one of the hard disk parameters stored in a pc s cmos memory was the wpcom number a marker of the track where stronger precompensation begins i e the transitions are shifted

for example boron 12 and carbon 13 nuclei both contain 7 neutrons and so are isotones similarly s cl ar k and ca nuclei are all isotones of 20 because they all contain 20 neutrons despite its similarity to the greek for same stretching the term was formed by the german physicist k guggenheimer by changing the p in isotope from p for proton to n for neutron the largest numbers of observationally stable nuclides exist for isotones 50 five kr sr y zr mo and 82 six ba la ce pr nd sm neutron numbers for which there are no stable isotones are 19 21 35 39 45 61 89 115 123 and 127 or more in contrast the proton numbers for which there are no stable isotopes are 43 61 and 83 or more this is related to nuclear magic numbers the number of nucleons forming complete shells within the nucleus e g 2 8 20 28 50 82 and 126 no more than one stable nuclide has the same odd neutron number except for 1 h and he 5 be and b 7 c and n 55 mo and ru and 107 hf and ta odd neutron

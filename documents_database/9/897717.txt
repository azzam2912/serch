letter sheets derive from the form in which written correspondence was made up before the mid 19th century letters were written on one or more sheets of paper that were folded and sealed in such a way that the address could be written on the outside the term lettersheet has been used to describe the unstamped folded sheet letters used before envelopes became popular envelopes were not used much before the second half of the 19th century because most countries postal rates calculated for the extra sheet of paper that made up the envelope thereby increasing the cost of mailing when an envelope was used pre paid lettersheets issued by postal operators are postal stationery because they bear imprinted stamps or indicia that indicate pre payment as opposed to adhesive stamps that are only printed by postal authorities lettersheets that require stamps to be applied have also been produced by private firms that usually have no authority for a pre paid indicia so postage must be paid by normal means at normal postage rates most country s postal authorities have issued true lettersheets at some stage however most have discontinued their use except in the form of an aerogram due

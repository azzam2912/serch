slg is short for super light gun it was first released in october 2007 as the 2008 model with an msrp of 200 the slg is the most affordable marker dye has ever produced and it is intended to compete with other budget electropneumatic markers like the smart parts ion unlike other electropneumatic spool valve markers on the market which use a solenoid valve to actuate the movement of the bolt the slg operates using a spool valve actuated by a mechanical solenoid and sear this unique single tube sear tripping blow forward operation is comparable to though not identical to the operation of the automag in the slg the recocking mechanism is air pressure acting on a smaller forward facing area to push the bolt back open when the pressure in the dump chamber which acts on a larger rearward facing area reaches a low pressure from firing and venting the dump chamber in the automag this is accomplished by the return spring if the sear is tripped but the dump chamber is not vented due to the bolt failing to close the bleed button on the back cap can be depressed which vents the dump to the outside

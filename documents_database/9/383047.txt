it causes a drag force to be exerted on the body ram pressure is given in tensor form as formula 1 where formula 2 is the density of the fluid this is the momentum flux per second in the formula 3 direction through a surface with normal in the formula 4 direction formula 5 are the components of the fluid velocity in these directions the total cauchy stress tensor formula 6 is the sum of this ram pressure and the isotropic thermal pressure in the absence of viscosity in the simple case when the relative velocity is normal to the surface and momentum is fully transferred to the object the ram pressure becomes formula 7 the eulerian form of the cauchy momentum equation for a fluid is formula 8 for isotropic pressure formula 9 where formula 10 is fluid velocity formula 2 the fluid density and formula 12 the gravitational acceleration the eulerian rate of change of momentum in direction formula 3 at a point is thus using einstein notation formula 14 substituting the conservation of mass expressed as formula 15 this is equivalent to formula 16 using the product rule and the kronecker delta formula 17 the first term

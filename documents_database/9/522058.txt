it crystallizes in fine silky needles and is soluble in water and alcohol mellitic acid may be prepared by warming mellite with ammonium carbonate boiling off the excess of the ammonium salt and adding ammonia to the solution the precipitated alumina is filtered off the filtrate evaporated and the ammonium salt of the acid purified by recrystallization the ammonium salt is then converted into the lead salt by precipitation with lead acetate and the lead salt is then decomposed by hydrogen sulfide the acid may also be prepared by the oxidation of pure carbon graphite or hexamethylbenzene by alkaline potassium permanganate in the cold or by hot concentrated nitric acid it is a very stable compound chlorine concentrated nitric acid and hydriodic acid do not react with it it is decomposed on dry distillation into carbon dioxide and pyromellitic acid cho when distilled with lime it gives carbon dioxide and benzene long digestion of the acid with an excess of phosphorus pentachloride forms the acid chloride which crystallizes in needles and melts at 190 c by heating the ammonium salt of the acid to 150 160 c while ammonia is evolved a mixture of paramide mellimide molecular formula and ammonium

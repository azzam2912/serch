such spaces were introduced by john tate in 1962 as an outgrowth of his work on uniformizing p adic elliptic curves with bad reduction using the multiplicative group in contrast to the classical theory of p adic analytic manifolds rigid analytic spaces admit meaningful notions of analytic continuation and connectedness the basic rigid analytic object is the n dimensional unit polydisc whose ring of functions is the tate algebra formula 1 made of power series in n variables whose coefficients approach zero in some complete nonarchimedean field k the tate algebra is the completion of the polynomial ring in n variables under the gauss norm taking the supremum of coefficients and the polydisc plays a role analogous to that of affine n space in algebraic geometry points on the polydisc are defined to be maximal ideals in the tate algebra and if k is algebraically closed these correspond to points in formula 2 whose coordinates have norm at most one an affinoid algebra is a k banach algebra that is isomorphic to a quotient of the tate algebra by an ideal an affinoid is then a subset of the unit polydisc on which the elements of this ideal vanish i

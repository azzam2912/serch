the earliest fossil evidence for plants of this type is the genus elkinsia of the late devonian age they flourished particularly during the carboniferous and permian periods pteridosperms declined during the mesozoic era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the cretaceous period though some pteridosperm like plants seem to have survived into eocene times based on fossil finds in tasmania the concept of pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century when palaeobotanists came to realise that many carboniferous fossils resembling fern fronds had anatomical features more reminiscent of the modern day seed plants the cycads in 1899 the german palaeobotanist henry potoni coined the term cycadofilices cycad ferns for such fossils suggesting that they were a group of non seed plants intermediate between the ferns and cycads shortly afterwards the british palaeobotanists frank oliver and dukinfield henry scott with the assistance of oliver s student at the time marie stopes made the critical discovery that some of these fronds genus lyginopteris were associated with seeds genus lagenostoma that had identical and very distinctive glandular hairs and concluded that both fronds and seeds belonged to the same plant soon additional evidence came to light suggesting that seeds were

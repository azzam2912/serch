it is a potent inhibitor of ribonuclease and topoisomerase ii by preventing the binding of the nucleic acid to the enzyme it stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation processes including the jak2 stat5 pathway in nb2 lymphoma cells erbb4 in neuroblastoma cells and map kinases shc proteins phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase and phospholipase c in pc12 cells it also inhibits apoptosis it prevents down regulation of ca impermeable glur2 receptors and inhibits calpain a ca activated protease that is activated during apoptosis it is used to inhibit protein biosynthesis in its initial stages nominally it is used in biological experiments as a protein inhibitor and as an ammonium salt known as aluminon it is used as a reagent to estimate the aluminium in water biological tissue and foods it was found that ata is a strong inhibitor of topoisomerases and other nucleases it might be useful for increasing efficiency of rna isolation it has been discovered that using aurintricarboxylic acid against influenza a post infection has a strong protective effect by inhibiting the virus ability to reproduce in cultured canine kidney cells it was found to reduce viral reproduction and infection when applied post infection but not when used as a vaccine it has

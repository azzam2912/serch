the song was the second song to be promoted off midnight love but wasn t released as a physical single but more of a promotional song as gaye prepped for a u s tour in the year of its release the single was released on february 8 1983 released on his midnight love album it was the sole ballad in the album which focused mainly on funk rhythms and dance material gaye was the sole lyricist of the song when asked how the lyrics of the song seemed more primitive than gaye s previous ballads the singer said he had run out of ideas on lyrics the song is described as a bare bones song with heavenly scat riffs gaye provides accentuated doo wop harmonies in the background while delivering both a jazzy inspired baritone and a gospel inflected tenor with falsetto stuck in the middle of it the original demo of the song titled baby baby baby showcased the frustration gaye was going through during the recording of midnight love the spoken intro by gaye was later modified by the singer while mention of the word shit was also taken off of the final track as was extra lyrics

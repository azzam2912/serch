the roseobacter clade falls within the alpha 3 subclass of the class alphaproteobacteria the first strain descriptions appeared in 1991 which described members roseobacter litoralis and roseobacter denitrificans both pink pigmented bacteriochlorophyll a producing strains isolated from marine algae the role members of the roseobacter lineage play in marine biogeochemical cycles and climate change cannot be overestimated roseobacters make up 25 of coastal marine bacteria and members of this lineage process a significant portion of the total carbon in the marine environment roseobacter clade plays an important role in global carbon sulphur cycle it can also degrade aromatic compounds uptake trace metal and form symbiotic relationship in term of its application roseobacter clade produce bioactive compounds has been used widely in aquaculture quorum sensing roseobacter is one of the most abundant and versatile microorganisms in the ocean they are diversified across different types of marine habitats from coastal to open oceans and from sea ice to sea floor they make up around 25 of marine communities during algal blooms 20 30 of the prokaryotic community are roseobacter members of roseobacter clade display diverse physiologies and are commonly found to be either free living particle associated or in commensal relationships with

it was released in june 2008 as the second single her album perfectly clear the song was jewel s second top 40 country hit although it was less successful than its predecessor reaching a peak of number 38 after a short chart run i do is a mid tempo love song backed primarily with percussion and features steel guitar and string fills and an electric guitar bridge the narrator describes a love that is troublesome and with barriers that need to be overcome well our hearts are locked inside an iron box we re both too afraid to reveal our most tender parts oh sfgate recommended i do as one of the best tracks in a review of perfectly clear alongside everything reminds me of you and till it feels like cheating they have a distinct and believable point of view and the arrangements merge modern nashville gloss with an acoustic base that works with jewel s idiosyncratic breathy voice also her typical lyrical slant taking a positive yet earthy look at everyday life fits country music as snugly as two lego blocks locking together hip online s review of the album was less favorable it is pretty unremarkable it

many members of the clusiaceae contain xanthonoids xanthonoid biosynthesis in cell cultures of hypericum androsaemum involves the presence of a benzophenone synthase condensing a molecule of benzoyl coa with three malonyl coa yielding to 2 4 6 trihydroxybenzophenone this intermediate is subsequently converted by a benzophenone 3 hydroxylase a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase leading to the formation of 2 3 4 6 tetrahydroxybenzophenone some examples are tomentonone zeyloxanthonone and calozeyloxanthone isolated from the bark of calophyllum tomentosum apetalinone a b c and d from calophyllum apetalum gaudichaudione a b c d e f g h gaudichaudiic acid a b c d e morellic acid and forbesione from garcinia gaudichaudii methylswertianin and bellidifolin from swertia punicea or psorospermin obtained from psorospermum febrifugum cassiaxanthone can be found in cassia reticulata cytotoxic xanthones gambogin morellin dimethyl acetal isomoreollin b moreollic acid gambogenic acid gambogenin isogambogenin desoxygambogenin gambogenin dimethyl acetal gambogellic acid gambogic acid isomorellin morellic acid desoxymorellin and hanburin can be isolated from the dry latex of garcinia hanburyi gamboge tree

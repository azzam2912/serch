production was handled by romeo vic c bryan wino dobbs and dj i roc the album has been certified gold by the riaa allmusic s stephen thomas erlewine said that despite lacking a single as memorable as gangsta s paradise he praised the album for remaining consistent with the formula used from the previous two efforts by providing a more elaborate production with lesser known samples and string instrumentations and coolio for being steadfast in having both dramedy and ear grabbing funk in his delivery concluding that i t s a small subtle difference but it s what makes my soul a thoroughly enjoyable record no matter if you re going out or staying in vibe contributor malik r singleton praised the overall energy throughout the album and coolio s didactic delivery displaying versatility ranging from intense nature of the business to inspirational homeboy but felt he crafted too many witless hooks and too much predictable phrasing on tracks like throwdown 2000 and let s do it concluding that despite its blatantly uneven ratio of rump shaking fluff to heavy hitting fly rhymes my soul proves why coolio s presence in hip hop s collective voice remains at least interesting

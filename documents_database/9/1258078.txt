these compounds generally have the formula lmg where l represents a bulky ligand the first examples of these stable magnesium i compounds were reported in 2007 the chemistry of mg is dominated by the 2 oxidation state and prior to 2007 only examples of crystalline compounds with short mg mg distances that may indicate an mg mg bond were known such as the ternary metal hydrides mgruh mgruh and mgirh and magnesium diboride calculations had also indicated the stability of the mg cation the preparation of the first compounds made involved the reduction of mg iodine complexes with potassium metal and the bulky ligands were both examples have the formula lmg where l represents the bulky anionic bidentate ligand x ray crystallographic studies showed an mg mg bond length of 285 1 pm and 284 6 pm theoretical studies indicate an essentially ionic formulation mg l the mg ion is the group 2 analogue of the group 12 hg present in e g mercury i chloride and cd ions present in cadmium i tetrachloroaluminate since then a variety of stable mg i compounds have been prepared some melting over 200 c some colorless others colored but all involving very bulky

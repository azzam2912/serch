like many other retrieval systems the rocchio feedback approach was developed using the vector space model the algorithm is based on the assumption that most users have a general conception of which documents should be denoted as relevant or non relevant therefore the user s search query is revised to include an arbitrary percentage of relevant and non relevant documents as a means of increasing the search engine s recall and possibly the precision as well the number of relevant and non relevant documents allowed to enter a query is dictated by the weights of the a b c variables listed below in the algorithm section the formula and variable definitions for rocchio relevance feedback are as follows formula 1 as demonstrated in the rocchio formula the associated weights a b c are responsible for shaping the modified vector in a direction closer or farther away from the original query related documents and non related documents in particular the values for b and c should be incremented or decremented proportionally to the set of documents classified by the user if the user decides that the modified query should not contain terms from either the original query related documents or non

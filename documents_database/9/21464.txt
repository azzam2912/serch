some authors restrict formula 2 to be a linear function but most authors instead call the resulting class if we use a nondeterministic machine instead we get the class which is equal to by savitch s theorem in terms of and a decision problem is if it is in and every problem in has a polynomial time many one reduction to it in other words there is a polynomial time algorithm that transforms instances of one to instances of the other with the same answer problems might be thought of as the hardest problems in an example of an problem is the problem of recognizing whether two regular expressions represent different languages where the expressions are limited to four operators union concatenation the kleene star zero or more copies of an expression and squaring two copies of an expression if the kleene star is left out then that problem becomes which is like except it is defined in terms of non deterministic turing machines rather than deterministic it has also been shown by l berman in 1980 that the problem of verifying falsifying any first order statement about real numbers that involves only addition and comparison but no multiplication is

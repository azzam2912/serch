myod which was discovered in the laboratory of harold m weintraub belongs to a family of proteins known as myogenic regulatory factors mrfs these bhlh basic helix loop helix transcription factors act sequentially in myogenic differentiation vertebrate mrf family members include myod1 myf5 myogenin and mrf4 myf6 in non vertebrate animals a single myod protein is typically found myod is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment myod is expressed at extremely low and essentially undetectable levels in quiescent satellite cells but expression of myod is activated in response to exercise or muscle tissue damage the effect of myod on satellite cells is dose dependent high myod expression represses cell renewal promotes terminal differentiation and can induce apoptosis although myod marks myoblast commitment muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the myod gene this is likely due to functional redundancy from myf5 and or mrf4 nevertheless the combination of myod and myf5 is vital to the success of myogenesis myod was cloned by an ingenious functional assay for muscle formation reported in cell in 1987 by davis weintraub and lassar it was first described as a nuclear phosphoprotein in 1988 by tapscott davis thayer cheng weintraub

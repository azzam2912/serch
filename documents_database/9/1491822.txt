such gravity anomalies have been mapped across the british isles and adjacent areas and they reveal aspects of these islands geological structure negative gravity anomalies are associated with local deficiencies in mass due to volumes of rock which are less dense than the average typically these anomalies are associated with granite plutons and with sedimentary basins gravity anomaly maps of ireland britain and the surrounding islands are interpreted as indicating the presence of granite plutons in the following areas the list is not exhaustive the weardale granite a batholith some 60 km by 25 km in extent underlying the alston block of the northern pennines was first detected by gravity survey drilling of the rookhope borehole subsequently confirmed the existence of this substantial body of granite a combination of gravity anomaly data and boreholes has permitted geologists to work out the shape of this pluton a further borehole was drilled at raydale to investigate the origin of the gravity anomaly underlying the askrigg block this proved the existence of the wensleydale granite a body of rock which is nowhere exposed at the surface similarly negative anomalies coincide with the following sedimentary basins amongst others the negative anomaly associated with the

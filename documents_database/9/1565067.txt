coli the 5 utr element acts as an rna thermometer regulating the expression of cspa in response to temperature by regulating temperature cspa proteins carry out the vital function of homeostasis the 5 utr was first suspected to be significant when mutations within this region of cspa significantly increased the stability of the transcript at 37 c the secondary structure of cspa mrna changes in response to temperature at 37 c the transcript is unstable and less efficiently translated than at lower temperatures unlike other rna thermometers such as fouru the secondary structure is not reliant on the melting of a hairpin in order to affect gene expression instead in temperatures below 20 c a cis regulatory region of ncrna in the 5 utr of cspa presents the shine dalgarno sequence and aug start codon to the ribosome in a more accessible way the precise mechanism for changing the mrna conformation is unknown cspa protein is then produced in significantly higher quantities making up over 2 of the cell s proteome during cold shock cspa protein binds hfq which upregulates production of sigma factors which mediate a stress response

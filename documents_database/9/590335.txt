it is a fundamental building block in classical control theory lead lag compensators influence disciplines as varied as robotics satellite control automobile diagnostics lcd displays and laser frequency stabilization they are an important building block in analog control systems and can also be used in digital control given the control plant desired specifications can be achieved using compensators i d pi pd and pid are optimizing controllers which are used to improve system parameters such as reducing steady state error reducing resonant peak improving system response by reducing rise time all these operations can be done by compensators as well used in cascade compensation technique both lead compensators and lag compensators introduce a pole zero pair into the open loop transfer function the transfer function can be written in the laplace domain as where x is the input to the compensator y is the output s is the complex laplace transform variable z is the zero frequency and p is the pole frequency the pole and zero are both typically negative or left of the origin in the complex plane in a lead compensator formula 2 while in a lag compensator formula 3 a lead lag compensator consists of a

sea squirts are named for their habit of squirting a stream of water from their exhalant siphons when touched at low tide pyura herdmani is readily identifiable by the pointed papillae on its tunic however the tunic can be highly variable in terms of its morphology which seems to depend largely on habitat type which includes intertidal and subtidal areas rocky and sandy substrata sheltered and exposed sites when growing on sandy bottoms p herdmani can grow a large peduncle to anchor itself into the sand this species is found in coastal areas of the temperate subtropical and tropical marine bioregions of southern africa in the temperate provinces its range overlaps with that of the morphologically similar p stolonifera a species that often occurs in sympatry and that can even hybridise with p herdmani m rius unpubl data its confirmed northeastern distribution limit is ponta do ouro in southern mozambique but it is possible that it occurs beyond this site pyura herdmani also occurs in north western africa with populations reported from morocco and senegal the taxonomy of this species is complicated and genetic data indicate that it comprises at least three mitochondrial dna lineages each of which may represent

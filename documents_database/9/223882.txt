according to it the force of gravity is a manifestation of the local geometry of spacetime mathematically the theory is modelled after bernhard riemann s metric geometry but the lorentz group of spacetime symmetries an essential ingredient of einstein s own theory of special relativity replaces the group of rotational symmetries of space later loop quantum gravity inherited this geometric interpretation of gravity and posits that a quantum theory of gravity is fundamentally a quantum theory of spacetime in the 1920s the french mathematician lie cartan formulated einstein s theory in the language of bundles and connections a generalization of riemannian geometry to which cartan made important contributions the so called einstein cartan theory of gravity not only reformulated but also generalized general relativity and allowed spacetimes with torsion as well as curvature in cartan s geometry of bundles the concept of parallel transport is more fundamental than that of distance the centerpiece of riemannian geometry a similar conceptual shift occurs between the invariant interval of einstein s general relativity and the parallel transport of einstein cartan theory in 1971 physicist roger penrose explored the idea of space arising from a quantum combinatorial structure his investigations resulted in the development

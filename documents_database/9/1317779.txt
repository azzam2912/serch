hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles are different from hydrogen fuel cell vehicles which use electrochemical conversion of hydrogen rather than combustion instead the hydrogen internal combustion engine is simply a modified version of the traditional gasoline powered internal combustion engine francois isaac de rivaz designed in 1806 the de rivaz engine the first internal combustion engine which ran on a hydrogen oxygen mixture tienne lenoir produced the hippomobile in 1863 paul dieges patented in 1970 a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline powered engine to run on hydrogen tokyo city university have been developing hydrogen internal combustion engine from 1970 recently developed hydrogen fueled bus and truck mazda has developed wankel engines that burn hydrogen the advantage of using ice internal combustion engine such as wankel and piston engines is that the cost of retooling for production is much lower existing technology ice can still be used to solve those problems where fuel cells are not a viable solution as yet for example in cold weather applications between 2005 2007 bmw tested a luxury car named the bmw hydrogen 7 powered by a hydrogen ice which achieved 301 km h 187 mph in tests at least two

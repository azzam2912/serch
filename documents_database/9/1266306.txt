over the last decades surgeons and researchers have been working hard to elaborate surgical cartilage repair interventions though these solutions do not perfectly restore articular cartilage some of the latest technologies start to bring very promising results in repairing cartilage from traumatic injuries or chondropathies these treatments are especially targeted by patients who suffer from articular cartilage damage they provide pain relief while at the same time slowing down the progression of damage or considerably delaying joint replacement knee replacement surgery articular cartilage repair treatments help patients to return to their original lifestyle regaining mobility going back to work and even practicing sports again though the different articular cartilage procedures differ in the used technologies and surgical techniques they all share the aim to repair articular cartilage whilst keeping options open for alternative treatments in the future broadly taken there are five major types of articular cartilage repair arthroscopic lavage is a cleaning up procedure of the knee joint this short term solution is not considered an articular cartilage repair procedure but rather a palliative treatment to reduce pain mechanical restriction and inflammation lavage focusses on removing degenerative articular cartilage flaps and fibrous tissue the main target group are patients

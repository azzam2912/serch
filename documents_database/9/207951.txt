it has a cubic structure and is used in cathode ray tubes crown glass and catalysts it is harmful to human skin and if swallowed in large quantity causes irritation excessive quantities of barium oxide may lead to death it is prepared by heating barium carbonate with coke carbon black or tar or by thermal decomposition of barium nitrate barium oxide is used as a coating for hot cathodes for example those in cathode ray tubes it replaced lead ii oxide in the production of certain kinds of glass such as optical crown glass while lead oxide raised the refractive index it also raised the dispersive power which barium oxide does not alter barium oxide also has use as an ethoxylation catalyst in the reaction of ethylene oxide and alcohols which takes place between 150 and 200 c it is also a source of pure oxygen through heat fluctuation it readily oxidises to bao by formation of a peroxide ion the complete peroxidation of bao to bao occurs at moderate temperatures but the increased entropy of the o molecule at high temperatures means that bao decomposes to o and bao at 1175k the reaction was used as a large scale

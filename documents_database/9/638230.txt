originally developed for use on microcom s own family of modems the protocol was later openly licensed and used by most of the modem industry notably the big three telebit usrobotics and hayes mnp was later supplanted by v 42bis which was used almost universally starting with the first v 32bis modems in the early 1990s modems are by their nature error prone devices noise on the telephone line a common occurrence can easily mimic the sounds used by the modems to transmit data thereby introducing errors that are difficult to notice for some tasks like reading or writing simple text a small number of errors can be accepted without causing too many problems for other tasks like file transfers even one error can destroy the entire file as modems increase in speed by using up more of the available bandwidth the chance that random noise would introduce errors also increases above 2400 bit s these errors are quite common to deal with this problem a number of file transfer protocols were introduced and implemented in various programs in general these protocols break down a file into a series of frames or packets containing a number of bytes from the

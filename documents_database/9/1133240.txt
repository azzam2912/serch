ptprn and ptprn2 this gene are both found to be major autoantigens associated with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus due to a close similarity in the gene sequences the protein encoded by this gene has traditionally been considered a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase ptp family ptps are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth differentiation mitotic cycle and oncogenic transformation however recent research has shown that the ptprn2 mouse homolog known as phogrin dephosphorylates the lipid phosphatidylinositol rather than tyrosine specifically phogrin was shown to act upon phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4 5 diphosphate whereas it has never been observed acting upon tyrosine ptprn2 should therefore be more accurately considered a pipase rather than a ptpase phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol pi are called phosphoinositides and play important roles in lipid signaling cell signaling and membrane trafficking the protein produced by ptprn2 possesses an extracellular region a single transmembrane region and a single intracellular catalytic domain and thus represents a receptor type ptp the catalytic domain of this ptp is most closely related to ptprn also known as ia 2 three alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene which encode distinct

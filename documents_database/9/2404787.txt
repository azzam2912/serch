basal eurasians may have been present in the near east as anatomically modern humans resided in the levant approximately 100 000 years ago and african related tools in arabia were likely developed by modern humans hence they may have settled in the levant or arabia the areas of the near east where basal eurasians resided may have been areas where contact with neanderthals who were known to have lived in west eurasia were not made basal eurasians are the sibling group that diverged from the main lineage of all other non african groups e g australian aborigines new guineans europeans east asians prior to their divergence from one another the admixture of the main lineage of all other non africans with neanderthals likely occurred 50 000 60 000 years ago after it diverged from basal eurasians the scenario of a non neanderthal admixed modern human population which is basal to other eurasians and resided in africa is plausible in particular north africa is a strong candidate as a location for the emergence of basal eurasians as it shares notable connection with eurasia natufians who share craniometric affinity with north africans or sub saharan africans and were of the y chromosomal

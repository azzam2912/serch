the noted art historian and specialist of the period erwin panofsky thought it merely an excellent replica of a design by van der weyden a view that seemed confirmed by the technical evidence available at the time however more recent studies confirm it as an autograph the painting is probably the last of van der weyden s half length madonnas although rather smaller than the others half length madonnas had gone out of fashion in the lowlands in the first half of the fifteenth century and it was van der weyden who had reintroduced them in other respects it is quite atypical of the period the tenderness of the embrace the infant child anchored against the shoulder and twisting round an example of contrapposto and the pensive gaze of the infant distinguish it from all its predecessors it seems certain that van der weyden s madonna is based on the italo byzantine cambrai madonna which had been brought back from rome by a cambrai monk in 1440 and installed with great ceremony in 1451 in the cath drale notre dame de gr ce de cambrai the name itself derives from the image at cambrai some 30 miles to the south

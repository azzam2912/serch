the principal investigator for cusp is mihir desai at the southwest research institute in san antonio texas it will fly on the maiden flight of the space launch system as a secondary payload of the artemis 1 mission planned to launch in 2021 to create a network of space weather stations would require many instruments scattered throughout space millions of miles apart but the cost of such a system is prohibitive though the cubesats can only carry a few instruments they are relatively inexpensive to launch because of their small mass and standardized design so cusp also serves as a test for creating a network of space science stations this cubesat will carry three scientific instruments the satellite features a cold gas thruster system for propulsion attitude control orientation and orbital maneuvering

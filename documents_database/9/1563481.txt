the precipitation reaction is analytically significant and can be used in qualitative or quantitative tests for phosphates this compound is dissolved by nitric acid or by ammonia it can also be formed as large crystals by gradual loss of ammonia from an ammoniacal solution of silver phosphate the reaction can be used in quantitative analysis of phosphate ions depending on the method of preparation different crystal forms of silver phosphate can be produced of the same lattice structure as well as being important in analytical chemistry the precipitation of silver phosphate is also used in silver staining of biological materials after reduction to silver metal as a magnifying agent for phosphate silver phosphate also found use in early photography as a light sensitive agent in 2010 silver phosphate was reported as having a high 90 quantum yield as a photocatalyst for the visible light photochemical splitting of water and for production of activated oxygen by the same method silver phosphate is also a potential material for incorporating silver ion antibacterial properties into materials silver pyrophosphate agpo cas no 13465 97 9 can be prepared as a white precipitate from reaction of silver i and pyrophosphate ions like silver orthophosphate it

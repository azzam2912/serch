this method is based on the mathematical concept of characteristic set introduced in the late 1940s by j f ritt it is fully independent of the gr bner basis method introduced by bruno buchberger 1965 even if gr bner bases may be used to compute characteristic sets wu s method is powerful for mechanical theorem proving in elementary geometry and provides a complete decision process for certain classes of problem it has been used in research in his laboratory klmm key laboratory of mathematics mechanization in chinese academy of science and around the world the main trends of research on wu s method concern systems of polynomial equations of positive dimension and differential algebra where ritt s results have been made effective wu s method has been applied in various scientific fields like biology computer vision robot kinematics and especially automatic proofs in geometry wu s method uses polynomial division to solve problems of the form where f is a polynomial equation and i is a conjunction of polynomial equations the algorithm is complete for such problems over the complex domain the core idea of the algorithm is that you can divide one polynomial by another to give a remainder

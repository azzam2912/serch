information is therefore less available for later retrieval as time passes and memory as well as memory strength wears away when an individual learns something new a neurochemical memory trace is created however over time this trace slowly disintegrates actively rehearsing information is believed to be a major factor counteracting this temporal decline it is widely believed that neurons die off gradually as we age yet some older memories can be stronger than most recent memories thus decay theory mostly affects the short term memory system meaning that older memories in long term memory are often more resistant to shocks or physical attacks on the brain it is also thought that the passage of time alone cannot cause forgetting and that decay theory must also take into account some processes that occur as more time passes the term decay theory was first coined by edward thorndike in his book the psychology of learning in 1914 this simply states that if a person does not access and use the memory representation they have formed the memory trace will fade or decay over time this theory was based on the early memory work by hermann ebbinghaus in the late 19th century the

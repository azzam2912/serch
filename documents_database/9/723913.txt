nimbus 7 was launched 24 october 1978 and czcs became operational on 2 november 1978 it was only designed to operate for one year as a proof of concept but in fact remained in service until 22 june 1986 its operation on board the nimbus 7 was limited to alternate days as it shared its power with the passive microwave scanning multichannel microwave radiometer czcs measured reflected solar energy in six channels at a resolution of 800 meters these measurements were used to map chlorophyll concentration in water sediment distribution salinity and the temperature of coastal waters and ocean currents czcs lay the foundations for subsequent satellite ocean color sensors and formed a cornerstone for international efforts to understand the ocean s role in the carbon cycle the most significant product of the czcs was its collection of so called ocean color imagery the color of the ocean in czcs images comes from substances in the water particularly phytoplankton microscopic free floating photosynthetic organisms as well as inorganic particulates because ocean color data is related to the presence of phytoplankton and particulates it can be used to calculate the concentrations of material in surface waters and the level of biological

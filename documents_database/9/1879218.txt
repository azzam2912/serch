in mammalian cells cgamp is synthesized by cyclic gmp amp synthase cgas from atp and gtp upon cytosolic dna stimulation cgamp produced by cgas contains mixed phosphodiester linkages with one between 2 oh of gmp and 5 phosphate of amp and the other between 3 oh of amp and 5 phosphate of gmp this molecule referred to as 2 3 cgamp cyclic g 2 5 pa 3 5 p functions as an endogenous second messenger inducing sting dependent type i interferon response cgamp has also been shown to be an effective adjuvant that boosts the production of antigen specific antibodies and t cell responses in mice cgamp exercises antiviral functions in the cell where it is produced but can also cross cell membranes by passive diffusion to exert effects on neighboring cells it may even be packaged into lentivirus such as hiv 1 poxvirus and herpes virus and under cell culture conditions has been found to transmit an antiviral signal to the cells infected with these viruses however there is reason to think that at least hiv is capable of evading this mechanism by some means

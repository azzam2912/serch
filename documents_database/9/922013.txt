it is constructed by a poincar s surface of section of the kicked rotator and is defined by where formula 4 and formula 5 are taken modulo formula 1 the properties of chaos of the standard map were established by boris chirikov in 1969 see more details at scholarpedia entry this map describes the poincar s surface of section of the motion of a simple mechanical system known as the kicked rotator the kicked rotator consists of a stick that is free of the gravitational force which can rotate frictionlessly in a plane around an axis located in one of its tips and which is periodically kicked on the other tip the standard map is a surface of section applied by a stroboscopic projection on the variables of the kicked rotator the variables formula 5 and formula 4 respectively determine the angular position of the stick and its angular momentum after the n th kick the constant k measures the intensity of the kicks on the kicked rotator the kicked rotator approximates systems studied in the fields of mechanics of particles accelerator physics plasma physics and solid state physics for example circular particle accelerators accelerate particles by applying periodic kicks

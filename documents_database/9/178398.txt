lysosomes are sacs of enzymes within cells that digest large molecules and pass the fragments on to other parts of the cell for recycling this process requires several critical enzymes if one of these enzymes is defective because of a mutation the large molecules accumulate within the cell eventually killing it lysosomal storage disorders are caused by lysosomal dysfunction usually as a consequence of deficiency of a single enzyme required for the metabolism of lipids glycoproteins sugar containing proteins or so called mucopolysaccharides individually lsds occur with incidences of less than 1 100 000 however as a group the incidence is about 1 5 000 1 10 000 most of these disorders are autosomal recessively inherited such as niemann pick disease type c but a few are x linked recessively inherited such as fabry disease and hunter syndrome mps ii the lysosome is commonly referred to as the cell s recycling center because it processes unwanted material into substances that the cell can use lysosomes break down this unwanted matter by enzymes highly specialized proteins essential for survival lysosomal disorders are usually triggered when a particular enzyme exists in too small an amount or is missing altogether when this happens

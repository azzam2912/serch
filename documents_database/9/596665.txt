it forms the ulnar border of the palm and its spindle like shape defines the hypothenar eminence of the palm together with the skin connective tissue and fat surrounding it its main function is to pull the little finger away from the other fingers i e abduction the abductor digiti minimi arises from the pisiform bone the pisohamate ligament and the flexor retinaculum its distal tendon ends in three slips that are inserted into the ulnopalmar margin of the proximal phalanx the palmar plate of the metacarpophalangeal joint and the sesamoid bone when present some fibers insert into the finger s dorsal aponeurosis which is why the muscle acts similar to a dorsal interosseus muscle additionally the ulnar most portion of the tendon inserts into the little finger s digital cord and the muscle thus forms part of a structure that flexes the metacarpophalangeal joint and extends the interphalangeal joints it is innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve c8 t1 the abductor digit minimi develops at an early stage from an ulnar muscle primordium of the superficial layer of the original undifferentiated mesenchyme of the hand together with the flexor digitorum superficialis medial primordia and the abductor

this was the main method of obtaining tomographs in medical imaging until the late 1970s it has since been largely replaced by more advanced imaging techniques such as ct and mri it remains in use today in a few specialized applications such as for acquiring orthopantomographs of the jaw in dental radiography focal plane tomography s development began in the 1930s by the italian radiologist alessandro vallebona as a means of reducing the problem of superimposition of structures which is inherent to projectional radiography focal plane tomography generally uses mechanical movement of an x ray source and film in unison to generate a tomogram using the principles of projective geometry synchronizing the movement of the radiation source and detector which are situated in the opposite direction from each other causes structures which are not in the focal plane being studied to blur out the blurring provided by focal plane tomography is only marginally effective since it only occurs in the x plane moreover since focal plane tomography uses plain x rays it is not particularly effective at resolving soft tissues the increased availability and power of computers in the 1960s and 70s gave rise to new imaging techniques such as

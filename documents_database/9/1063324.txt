one of the lens surfaces is shaped like a cap from a torus see figure at right and the other one is usually spherical such a lens behaves like a combination of a spherical lens and a cylindrical lens toric lenses are used primarily in eyeglasses contact lenses and intraocular lenses to correct astigmatism a torus is the spatial body resulting when a circle with radius r rotates around an axis lying within the same plane as the circle at a distance r from the circle s centre see figure at right if r r a ring torus is produced if r r a horn torus is produced where the opening is contracted into a single point r sphere with radius r the greatest radius of curvature of the toric lens surface corresponds to the smallest refractive power s given by where n is the index of refraction of the lens material the smallest radius of curvature r corresponds to the greatest refractive power s given by since the lens behaves approximately like a combination of a spherical lens with optical power s and a cylindrical lens with power in ophthalmology and optometry is called the cylinder power of the

there are two major groups of sterol producing osc enzymes sterols and triterpenes are extremely diverse classes of natural products particularly in plants which often contain numerous osc enzymes with different substrate and product specificities common examples include lupeol synthase and beta amyrin synthase osc enzymes catalytic mechanism is similar to the prokaryotic squalene hopene cyclase directed evolution and protein design have been used to identify small numbers of point mutations that alter the product specificities of osc enzymes most notably in altering a cycloartenol synthase to produce predominantly lanosterol oxidosqualene cyclase is a monomeric enzyme its active site consists of a depression between two barrel domains the active site is mostly made up of acidic amino acids in the majority of organisms the residues in the active site make it energetically favorable for oxidosqualene to take on a more folded conformation which closely resembles its product this crucially sets the substrate up for the series of reactions that form the rings oxidosqualene is located in the cell s microsome membranes where it can easily harvest its hydrophobic substrate and turn out its hydrophobic product oxidosqualene cyclase is a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway it catalyzes the formation

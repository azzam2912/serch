these scriptures are recited in divination and when treating the sick the script is used for non scriptural texts as well such as astrological almanacs but predominantly ones which concern religion only shaba priests are literate in the script the script is predominantly pictographic it is limited in scope and is not sufficient to write the ersu language fully some 200 glyphs have been identified most of them depicting and resembling concrete objects these are combined into composite diagrams the system is proto writing as the relationship between form and meaning is fixed although glyphs may be written simply or elaborately they may not be chosen at the author s whim and pronunciation and interpretation is consistent across the several counties of the ersu speaking area however it typically takes many words to explain a few glyphs the connection to language is definite in the object depicted but the position and context of the glyphs does not have a fixed linguistic correlation writing is done with a bamboo brush or animal hair dipped in white black red blue green and yellow colored ink the color chosen may affect the meaning for example the glyph stars and moon written in black

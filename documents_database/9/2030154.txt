the allmusic review by stewart mason awarded the album 4 stars stating all that is tied touches on every facet of blake s unique piano style summing up this underrated composer and educator s career in the space of 12 brief original compositions on all about jazz norman weinstein noted blake performs the twelve numbers with characteristic daring the monk influence has grown refined over the decades it began with a foregrounding of monk s surprising dissonances and a widening of monk s oddly placed silences but unlike monk blake brings a kind of european classical sensibility both melodically and harmonically to his improvisations while jerry d souza said the pianist s thoughts are as fertile as one could ever wish them to be and he makes fulsome use of them as he enunciates with authority on all that is tied a solo recording made forty years after his first album time has not stilled his passion it still beats strongly within him along with his sense for discovery blake is always alert for a new direction which will spring a surprise his sense of fun is an integral part of his makeup and he continues to explore it delightfully

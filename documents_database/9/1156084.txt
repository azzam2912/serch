the matrix can have a considerable effect on the way the analysis is conducted and the quality of the results are obtained such effects are called matrix effects for example the ionic strength of the solution can have an effect on the activity coefficients of the analytes the most common approach for accounting for matrix effects is to build a calibration curve using standard samples with known analyte concentration and which try to approximate the matrix of the sample as much as possible this is especially important for solid samples where there is a strong matrix influence in cases with complex or unknown matrices the standard addition method can be used in this technique the response of the sample is measured and recorded for example using an electrode selective for the analyte then a small volume of standard solution is added and the response is measured again ideally the standard addition should increase the analyte concentration by a factor of 1 5 to 3 and several additions should be averaged the volume of standard solution should be small enough to disturb the matrix as little as possible matrix enhancement and suppression is frequently observed in modern analytical routines such as

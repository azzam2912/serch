the prototype up 50 was the first in a series built by general electric for union pacific s long haul cargo services and marketed by the alco ge partnership until 1953 the prototype was introduced in 1948 and was followed by three series of production locomotives at one point union pacific said the gtels hauled more than 10 of the railroad s freight fuel economy was poor for the turbine consumed roughly twice as much fuel as an equally powerful diesel engine this was initially not a problem because union pacific s turbines burned bunker c heavy fuel oil that was less expensive than diesel but this highly viscous fuel is difficult to handle with a room temperature consistency similar to tar or molasses to solve this problem a heater was built into the fuel tanks and later into fuel tenders to heat the fuel to before feeding it into the turbine eventually up switched from bunker c to modified no 6 heavy fuel oil which contained fewer pollutants and solvents soot buildup and blade erosion caused by corrosive ash plagued all of the turbines changes to the air intake systems on the production turbine locomotives improved the quality of

it is mostly connected to the theme in complex system emergence monte carlo method computational sociology multi agent system and evolutionary programming the concept itself is simple enough actually reaching this conceptual point took a while complex mathematical models have been and are common deceivingly simple models only have their roots in the late forties and took the advent of the microcomputer to really get up to speed the aim is to construct parallel simulations consisting of computational devices referred to as agents with given properties in order to model the target phenomena the subject is the process of emergence from the lower micro level of a social system to the higher or macro level the history of agent based modeling can be traced back to von neumann machines the concept of a machine capable of reproduction the device he proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself the concept was then extended by von neumann s friend stanislaw ulam also a mathematician who suggested that the machine be built on paper as a collection of cells on a grid the idea intrigued von neumann who drew it up thus creating the first of the devices

bloom found that the average student tutored one to one using mastery learning techniques performed two standard deviations better than students who learn via conventional instructional methods that is the average tutored student was above 98 of the students in the control class additionally the variation of the students achievement changed about 90 of the tutored students attained the level of summative achievement reached by only the highest 20 of the control class bloom s graduate students j anania and a j burke conducted studies of this effect at different grade levels and in different schools observing students with great differences in cognitive achievement attitudes and academic self concept though bloom concluded that one to one tutoring is too costly for most societies to bear on a large scale bloom conjectured that a combination of two or three altered variables may result in a similar performance improvement bloom thus challenged researchers and teachers to find methods of group instruction as effective as one to one tutoring bloom classified alterable variables that may have in combination a 2 sigma effect as the following objects of change process bloom and his graduate students considered and tested various combinations of these variables focusing

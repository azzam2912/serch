it is a special case of the profinite topology on a group this particular topological space was introduced by where it was used to prove the infinitude of primes the arithmetic progression associated to two possibly non distinct numbers a and k where formula 1 is the set of integers to give the set formula 3 a topology means to say which subsets of formula 3 are open in a manner that satisfies the following axioms the family of all arithmetic progressions does not satisfy these axioms the union of arithmetic progressions need not be an arithmetic progression itself e g is not an arithmetic progression so the evenly spaced integer topology is defined to be the topology generated by the family of arithmetic progressions this is the coarsest topology that includes as open subsets the family of all arithmetic progressions that is arithmetic progressions are a subbase for the topology since the intersection of any finite collection of arithmetic progressions is again an arithmetic progression the family of arithmetic progressions is a base for the topology meaning that every open set is a union of arithmetic progressions the furstenberg integers are separable and metrizable but incomplete by urysohn s

this correlation is influenced by several evolutionary processes such as genetic drift founder effect bottleneck genetic hitchhiking meiotic drive mutation gene flow inbreeding natural selection or the wahlund effect but it was originally designed to measure the amount of allelic fixation owing to genetic drift the concept of f statistics was developed during the 1920s by the american geneticist sewall wright who was interested in inbreeding in cattle however because complete dominance causes the phenotypes of homozygote dominants and heterozygotes to be the same it was not until the advent of molecular genetics from the 1960s onwards that heterozygosity in populations could be measured f can be used to define effective population size the measures f f and f are related to the amounts of heterozygosity at various levels of population structure together they are called f statistics and are derived from f the inbreeding coefficient in a simple two allele system with inbreeding the genotypic frequencies are the value for f is found by solving the equation for f using heterozygotes in the above inbred population this becomes one minus the observed frequency of heterozygotes in a population divided by the expected frequency of heterozygotes at hardy weinberg equilibrium

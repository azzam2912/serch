the idea was first conceived and the basic concepts invented in 1973 by rick coupland and john moore old friends and systems programmers who were working at ramada inns micor division phoenix az at the time the project lasted from 1973 until 1979 included two product version but never reached commercial success due to inadequate funding in 1975 coupland left micor to work full time on creating the instrument building the first and 8 bit version micor subsequently funded the project and a team including a consulting professor of music and consulting physicist along with the usual engineers they designed and built a prototype of the 12 bit version due to funding constraints the prototype was rushed to a showing at the conference where the fragile wire wrapped prototype failed to function leading to significant embarrassment however the concept and design was solidly proven and with continued funding would have been a commercial instrument representing a significant improvement in the state of the art the performer used a frequency domain specification of the musical voice harmonics and created an adsr function to modify it the instrument used a waveform buffer now a widespread practice but independently conceived by moore and

it has a single ring coxeter diagram and is named by its two regular cells wide angle perspective views it contains a subgroup h2 tiling the alternated order 4 hexagonal tiling with vertex figure 3 4 a lower symmetry form index 6 of this honeycomb can be constructed with 4 3 4 3 symmetry represented by a trigonal trapezohedron fundamental domain and coxeter diagram this lower symmetry can be extended by restoring one mirror as there are 5 related uniform honeycombs generated within the same family generated with 2 or more rings of the coxeter group the rectified cubic octahedral honeycomb is a compact uniform honeycomb constructed from cuboctahedron and rhombicuboctahedron cells in a cuboid vertex figure it has a coxeter diagram the cyclotruncated cubic octahedral honeycomb is a compact uniform honeycomb constructed from truncated cube octahedron cells in a square antiprism vertex figure it has a coxeter diagram it can be seen as somewhat analogous to the trioctagonal tiling with truncated square and triangle facets the cyclotruncated octahedral cubic honeycomb is a compact uniform honeycomb constructed from cube truncated octahedron cells in a triangular antiprism vertex figure it has a coxeter diagram it contains an h2 subgroup tetrahexagonal tiling

for foh the signal is reconstructed as a piecewise linear approximation to the original signal that was sampled a mathematical model such as foh or more commonly the zero order hold is necessary because in the sampling and reconstruction theorem a sequence of dirac impulses x t representing the discrete samples x nt is low pass filtered to recover the original signal that was sampled x t however outputting a sequence of dirac impulses is impractical devices can be implemented using a conventional dac and some linear analog circuitry to reconstruct the piecewise linear output for either predictive or delayed foh even though this is not what is physically done an identical output can be generated by applying the hypothetical sequence of dirac impulses x t to a linear time invariant system otherwise known as a linear filter with such characteristics which for an lti system are fully described by the impulse response so that each input impulse results in the correct piecewise linear function in the output first order hold is the hypothetical filter or lti system that converts the ideally sampled signal to the piecewise linear signal resulting in an effective impulse response of the effective frequency response

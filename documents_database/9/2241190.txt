it is usually the last purification step in the ammonia production process sequence upstream of the actual ammonia production the purpose of the final purification step upstream of the actual ammonia production is to remove all components that are poisonous for the sensitive ammonia synthesis catalyst this can be done with the following concepts the liquid nitrogen wash has two principle functions the carbon monoxide must be removed completely from the synthesis gas i e syngas since it is poisonous for the sensitive ammonia synthesis catalyst the components argon and methane are inert gases within the ammonia synthesis loop but would enrich there and call for a purge gas system with synthesis gas losses or additional expenditures for a purge gas separation unit the main sources for the supply of feed gases are partial oxidation processes since the synthesis gas exiting the partial oxidation process consists mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen usually a sulfur tolerant co shift i e water gas shift reaction is installed in order to convert as much carbon monoxide into hydrogen as possible shifting carbon monoxide and water into hydrogen also produces carbon dioxide usually this is removed in an acid gas scrubbing process together

to the naked eye it appears as a single star with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 3 74 making it the brightest visible star in the constellation a telescope shows a curved line of three pale blue stars or pale yellow stars depending on the scope s focus william herschel who discovered it in 1781 commented that it is one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens the star system consists of three be stars monocerotis a monocerotis b and monocerotis c there is also an additional visual companion star that is probably not physically close to the other three stars the three stars of monocerotis lie approximately in a straight line component b is 7 from component a and component c a further 3 away the stars have a common proper motion across the sky and very similar radial velocities they share a single hipparcos satellite identifier and are assumed to be at the same distance around 700 light years based on their parallax monocerotis is classified as a variable star although it is unclear which of the three components causes the brightness changes the magnitude range is given as 3 77 to 3 84 in the

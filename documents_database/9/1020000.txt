intended to be a faster and more torque laden version suzuki s similar bandit 1200 with more up to date technology the gsx1400 was still characterized as a disco era initially the bike was only produced for japan and europe opening to the australian market from 2001 although there was a movement to try to make the gsx1400 available in the us and canada the gsx1400 is redlined at 9 000 rpm however in practice there is little point in taking it past 7 000 because the bike has strong low and mid range performance the fuel injection throttle bodies are also fairly small bore and ultimately limit the breathing and therefore power of the engine at high revs this does again however enhance low end torque and response conversions including turbocharging and supercharging can be implemented to get around these breathing limitations and deliver significant increases in power and torque uk market models changed in detail over the years on later models including a wheel colour change from white to black to swap from a 4 into 2 exhaust system to a 4 into 1 system and yoshimura branded exhaust silencers although this was available as a dealer fit

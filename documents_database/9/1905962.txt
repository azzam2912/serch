when solving this equation formula 1 by the method of separation of variables formula 2 with the solution formula 7 can be written as the product of a radial spheroidal wave function formula 8 and an angular spheroidal wave function formula 9 by formula 10 here formula 11 with formula 12 being the interfocal length of the elliptical cross section of the oblate spheroid the radial wave function formula 8 satisfies the linear ordinary differential equation the angular wave function satisfies the differential equation it is the same differential equation as in the case of the radial wave function however the range of the radial coordinate formula 16 is different from that of the angular coordinate formula 17 the eigenvalue formula 18 of this sturm liouville differential equation is fixed by the requirement that formula 19 must be finite for formula 20 for formula 21 these two differential equations reduce to the equations satisfied by the associated legendre polynomials for formula 22 the angular spheroidal wave functions can be expanded as a series of legendre functions the differential equations given above for the oblate radial and angular wave functions can be obtained from the corresponding equations for the prolate spheroidal

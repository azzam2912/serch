such functionality may include digital signal processing or sound synthesis audio plug ins usually provide their own user interface which often contains gui widgets that can be used to control and visualise the plug in s audio parameters there are three broad classes of audio plug in those which transform existing audio samples those which generate new audio samples through sound synthesis and those which analyse existing audio samples although all plug in types can technically perform audio analysis only specific formats provide a mechanism for analysis data to be returned to the host the program used to dynamically load audio plug ins is called a plug in host example hosts include mainstage bidule reaper and sonic visualiser plug ins can also be used to host other plug ins communication between host and plug in s is determined by a plug in api the api declares functions and data structures that the plug in must define in order to be usable by a plug in host additionally a functional specification may be provided which defines how the plug in should respond to function calls and how the host should expect to handle function calls to the plug in the specification

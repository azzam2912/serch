the cancellation technique with part of each term cancelling with part of the next term is known as the method of differences for example the series the series of reciprocals of pronic numbers simplifies as telescoping sums are finite sums in which pairs of consecutive terms cancel each other leaving only the initial and final terms let formula 3 be a sequence of numbers then and if formula 5 in probability theory a poisson process is a stochastic process of which the simplest case involves occurrences at random times the waiting time until the next occurrence having a memoryless exponential distribution and the number of occurrences in any time interval having a poisson distribution whose expected value is proportional to the length of the time interval let x be the number of occurrences before time t and let t be the waiting time until the x th occurrence we seek the probability density function of the random variable t we use the probability mass function for the poisson distribution which tells us that where is the average number of occurrences in any time interval of length 1 observe that the event x x is the same as the event t

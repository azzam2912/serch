it is a colonial coral with thin encrusting laminae it is native to the central indo pacific oxypora glabra is a species of scleractinia coral otherwise known as stony or hard coral and part of the family lobophylliidae which is characteristic of robust coral colonies corals are extremely plastic organisms in that their structures rely on their environment making construction widely variable o glabra colonies are dark brown in color and have an encrusting laminae or plate formation with twisted septa that form short clockwise spiral structures the size of plating in o glabra ranges between relatively small 1m throughout its depth distribution the distribution of costae a rib like structure is numerous at the center of the coral colony and declines moving out toward the edges the corallite diameter is small and not as widely spaced as other oxypora species corals are often described by their morphological variation this is problematic in the case of o glabra because lobophylliidae consists of 12 genera including echinophyllia which is often mistaken for species in the oxypora genera because there is a history of insufficient descriptions of o glabra a molecular approach is needed to delaminate the scleractinia coral in a 2016

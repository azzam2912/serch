absolute democracies function as completely changeable systems where things such as rights and privileges begin to lose meaning because rights can be voted away at any election there are no supermajorities in absolute democracies because that is just an added limit on democracy nothing is stable or long term because everything is under scrutiny from the voters an absolute monarchy suggests total authoritarian rule from a monarch or other leading dictator while in this type of democracy 100 of all power is concentrated into the majority opinion for each issue for example if a king decides he wants to make free pies a human right there is nothing stopping him from doing that but in an absolute democracy rights become superfluous because they change every time there is an election and there is nothing keeping legislation permanent or long term

it has a barbed tail and feet with thick claws the ethereal marauder s head is triangular extending from the body into a large triangular mouth with a single hook like claw at each point and rows of teeth going back down the throat also going down each point like the ethereal filcher and phase spider the ethereal marauder is an expert at traveling between the ethereal plane and the material plane unlike the filcher whose purpose for doing this is to steal the marauder is more like the spider and does it for the purpose of hunting it looks in the ethereal plane for a place where it suspects a victim will be and then goes to the material plane hoping to catch its prey unaware it bites them kills them and then shifts back to the ethereal plane due to its fearsome mouth and raptor like body it is somewhat better at this than the phase spider if an ethereal marauder is injured it prefers to teleport back to the ethereal plane rather than put up a fight ethereal marauders cannot speak they are regarded as neutral in alignment but have distinctly evil habits

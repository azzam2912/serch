this is equivalent to a special case of a metric connection is a riemannian connection there is a unique such which is torsion free the levi civita connection in this case the bundle e is the tangent bundle tm of a manifold and the metric on e is induced by a riemannian metric on m another special case of a metric connection is a yang mills connection which satisfies the yang mills equations of motion most of the machinery of defining a connection and its curvature can go through without requiring any compatibility with the bundle metric however once one does require compatibility this metric connection defines an inner product hodge star hodge dual and laplacian which are required to formulate the yang mills equations let formula 1 be any local sections of the vector bundle e and let x be a vector field on the base space m of the bundle let formula 2 define a bundle metric that is a metric on the vector fibers of e then a connection d on e is a metric connection if here d is the ordinary differential of a scalar function the covariant derivative can be extended so that it acts

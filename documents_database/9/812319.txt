the measure preserving dynamical system formula 3 is known as the base flow of the random dynamical system the maps formula 4 are often known as shift maps since they shift time the base flow is often ergodic the parameter formula 5 may be chosen to run over each map formula 4 is required furthermore as a family the maps formula 4 satisfy the relations in other words the maps formula 4 form a commutative monoid in the cases formula 26 and formula 27 or a commutative group in the cases formula 28 and formula 29 in the case of random dynamical system driven by a wiener process formula 30 where formula 2 is the two sided classical wiener space the base flow formula 1 would be given by this can be read as saying that formula 4 starts the noise at time formula 5 instead of time 0

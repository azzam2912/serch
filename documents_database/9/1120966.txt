this issue was popularised by david hendry who argued that lack of stability of coefficients frequently caused forecast failure and therefore we must routinely test for structural stability structural stability i e the time invariance of regression coefficients is a central issue in all applications of linear regression models for linear regression models the chow test is often used to test for a single break in mean at a known time period for this test assesses whether the coefficients in a regression model are the same for periods and other challenges occur where there are the chow test is not applicable in these situations since it only applies to models with a known breakpoint and where the error variance remains constant before and after the break in general the cusum cumulative sum and cusum sq cusum squared tests can be used to test the constancy of the coefficients in a model the bounds test can also be used for cases 1 and 2 the sup wald i e the supremum of a set of wald statistics sup lm i e the supremum of a set of lagrange multiplier statistics and sup lr i e the supremum of a set of

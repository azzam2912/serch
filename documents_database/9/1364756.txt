it is an oxide of carbon an oxocarbon and can be described as the carbon carbon covalent dimer of carbon monoxide it can also be thought of as the dehydrated form of glyoxylic acid or a ketone of ethenone the existence of ethylenedione was first suggested in 1913 however for over a century the compound had eluded all attempts to synthesize and observe it and it came to be considered a purely hypothetical compound or at best an exceedingly coy molecule in 2015 a research group reported the creation of ethylenedione by using laser light to eject an electron from the corresponding stable singly charged anion and its spectroscopic characterization however the reported spectrum was later found to match that of the oxyallyl diradical formed by rearrangement or disproportionation under the high energy experimental conditions rather than simple electron loss despite the existence of the closed shell kekul structure o c c o the lowest bound state of ethyledione is a triplet it would then be a diradical with an electronic structure motif similar to the oxygen molecule however when the molecule is distorted away from its equilibrium geometry the potential surfaces of the triplet and singlet states intersect allowing

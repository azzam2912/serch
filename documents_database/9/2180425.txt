graphql was developed internally by facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015 on 7 november 2018 the graphql project was moved from facebook to the newly established graphql foundation hosted by the non profit linux foundation since 2012 graphql s rise has followed the adoption timeline as set out by lee byron graphql s creator with accuracy byron s goal is to make graphql omnipresent across web platforms it provides an efficient robust and flexible approach to developing web apis and has been compared and contrasted with rest and other web service architectures it allows clients to define the structure of the data required and the same structure of the data is returned from the server therefore preventing excessively large amounts of data from being returned but this has implications for how effective web caching of query results can be the flexibility and richness of the query language also adds complexity that may not be worthwhile for simple apis it consists of a type system query language and execution semantics static validation and type introspection graphql supports reading writing mutating and subscribing to changes to data realtime updates most commonly implemented using webhooks major graphql clients include apollo

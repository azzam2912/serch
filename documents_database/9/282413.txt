it exists at the interface of the lithosphere atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere the pedosphere is the skin of the earth and only develops when there is a dynamic interaction between the atmosphere air in and above the soil biosphere living organisms lithosphere unconsolidated regolith and consolidated bedrock and the hydrosphere water in on and below the soil the pedosphere is the foundation of terrestrial life on earth the pedosphere acts as the mediator of chemical and biogeochemical flux into and out of these respective systems and is made up of gaseous mineralic fluid and biologic components the pedosphere lies within the critical zone a broader interface that includes vegetation pedosphere groundwater aquifer systems regolith and finally ends at some depth in the bedrock where the biosphere and hydrosphere cease to make significant changes to the chemistry at depth as part of the larger global system any particular environment in which soil forms is influenced solely by its geographic position on the globe as climatic geologic biologic and anthropogenic changes occur with changes in longitude and latitude the pedosphere lies below the vegetative cover of the biosphere and above the hydrosphere and lithosphere the soil forming process pedogenesis can begin without

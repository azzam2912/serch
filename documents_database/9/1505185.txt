the toxicity of the individual congeners may vary by orders of magnitude with the tefs the toxicity of a mixture of dioxins and dioxin like compounds can be expressed in a single number the toxic equivalency teq it is a single figure resulting from the product of the concentration and individual tef values of each congener the tef teq concept has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulatory control while the initial and current set of tefs only apply to dioxins and dioxin like chemicals dlcs the concept can theoretically be applied to any group of chemicals satisfying the extensive similarity criteria used with dioxins primarily that the main mechanism of action is shared across the group thus far only the dlcs have had such a high degree of evidence of toxicological similarity there have been several systems over the years in operation such as the international toxic equivalents for dioxins and furans only represented as i teq as well as several country specific tefs the present world health organization scheme represented as who teq which includes pcbs is now universally accepted humans and wildlife are rarely exposed to solitary contaminants but rather to complex mixtures of potentially harmful

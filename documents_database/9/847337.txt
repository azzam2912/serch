such a matrix may be derived by taking the identity matrix and replacing one of the zero elements with a non zero value a typical shear matrix is shown below the name shear reflects the fact that the matrix represents a shear transformation geometrically such a transformation takes pairs of points in a linear space that are purely axially separated along the axis whose row in the matrix contains the shear element and effectively replaces those pairs by pairs whose separation is no longer purely axial but has two vector components thus the shear axis is always an eigenvector of s a shear parallel to the x axis results in formula 2 and formula 3 in matrix form similarly a shear parallel to the y axis has formula 5 and formula 6 in matrix form clearly the determinant will always be 1 as no matter where the shear element is placed it will be a member of a skew diagonal that also contains zero elements as all skew diagonals have length at least two hence its product will remain zero and won t contribute to the determinant thus every shear matrix has an inverse and the inverse is simply a

this technique involves the injection of local anesthetic agents in close proximity to the brachial plexus temporarily blocking the sensation and ability to move the upper extremity the subject can remain awake during the ensuing surgical procedure or s he can be sedated or even fully anesthetized if necessary there are several techniques for blocking the nerves of the brachial plexus these techniques are classified by the level at which the needle or catheter is inserted for injecting the local anesthetic interscalene block on the neck supraclavicular block immediately above the clavicle infraclavicular block below the clavicle and axillary block in the axilla armpit general anesthesia may result in low blood pressure undesirable decreases in cardiac output central nervous system depression respiratory depression loss of protective airway reflexes such as coughing need for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and residual anesthetic effects the most important advantage of brachial plexus block is that it allows for the avoidance of general anesthesia and therefore its attendant complications and side effects although brachial plexus block is not without risk it usually affects fewer organ systems than general anesthesia brachial plexus blockade may be a reasonable option when all of the following criteria are

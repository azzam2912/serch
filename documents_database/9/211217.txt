it exhibits the nernst effect cdas dissociates between 220 and 280 c according to the reaction an energy barrier was found for the nonstoichiometric vaporization of arsenic due to the irregularity of the partial pressures with temperature the range of the energy gap is from 0 5 to 0 6 ev cdas melts at 716 c and changes phase at 615 c pure cadmium arsenide undergoes several phase transitions at high temperatures making phases labeled stable metastable and at 593 the polymorphic transition occurs single crystal x ray diffraction was used to determine the lattice parameters of cdas between 23 and 700 c transition occurs slowly and therefore is most likely an intermediate phase transition occurs much faster than and has very small thermal hysteresis this transition results in a change in the fourfold axis of the tetragonal cell causing crystal twinning the width of the loop is independent of the rate of heating although it becomes narrower after several temperature cycles the compound cadmium arsenide has a lower vapor pressure 0 8 atm than both cadmium and arsenic separately cadmium arsenide does not decompose when it is vaporized and re condensed carrier concentration in cdas are usually 1 4

there are two isoforms of the rap1 protein each encoded by a separate gene rap1a and rap1b rap1 belongs to ras related protein family gtpases are inactive when in their gdp bound form and become active when they bind to gtp gtpase activating proteins gaps and guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs regulate small gtpases with gaps promoting the gdp bound inactive form and gefs promoting the gtp bound active form when bound to gtp small gtpases regulate myriad cellular processes these proteins are divided into families depending on their protein structure and the most well studied is the ras superfamily of which rap1 is a member whereas ras is known for its role in cell proliferation and survival rap1 is predominantly involved in cell adhesion and cell junction formation ras and rap are regulated by different sets of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and gtpase activating proteins thus providing one level of specificity the identification of rap1 effector proteins has provided important insights into mechanisms by which rap1 regulates t cell receptor tcr signaling to integrins a constitutively active rap1 construct rap1g12v was used as a bait in a yeast two hybrid screen to identify rapl as a rap1 binding protein

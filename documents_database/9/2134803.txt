the chchd10 gene produces a 14 9 kda protein composed of 149 amino acids it is enriched at cristae junctions in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria the structure of the protein contains a nonstructured n terminal region a hydrophobic helix and a c terminal chch domain which contains a cx 9 c motif and two additional cysteines a total of four cysteines are predicted to form two disulfide bonds this gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein that is enriched at cristae junctions in the intermembrane space it may play a role in cristae morphology maintenance or oxidative phosphorylation chchd10 related disorders include myopathy isolated mitochondrial autosomal dominant immd frontotemporal dementia and or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 ftdals2 spinal muscular atrophy jokela type smaj frontotemporal dementia and or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 ftdals2 is a neurodegenerative disorder with high intrafamilial variation with phenotypes such as frontotemporal dementia and or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis frontotemporal dementia is characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atrophy associated with neuronal loss gliosis and dementia patients exhibit progressive changes in social behavioral and or language function amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by the death of motor neurons in the brain brainstem and spinal cord resulting in

the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor fgf family and specifically a member of the endocrine subfamily which includes fgf23 and fgf15 19 fgf21 is the primary endogenous agonist of the fgf21 receptor which is composed of the co receptors fgf receptor 1 and klotho fgf family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities and are involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development cell growth morphogenesis tissue repair tumor growth and invasion fgfs act through a family of four fgf receptors binding is complicated and requires both interaction of the fgf molecule with an fgf receptor and binding to heparin through an heparin binding domain endocrine fgfs lack a heparin binding domain and thus can be released into the circulation fgf21 is a hepatokine i e a hormone secreted by the liver that regulates simple sugar intake and preferences for sweet foods via signaling through fgf21 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and correlates with reduced dopamine neurotransmission within the nucleus accumbens a single nucleotide polymorphism of the fgf21 gene the fgf21 rs838133 variant has been identified as a genetic mechanism responsible for the sweet tooth behavioral

producing scenarios requires estimates of future population levels economic activity the structure of governance social values and patterns of technological change economic and energy modelling such as the world3 or the poles models can be used to analyse and quantify the effects of such drivers these scenarios can be thought of as stories of possible futures they allow the description of factors that are difficult to quantify such as governance social structures and institutions morita et al assessed the literature on global futures scenarios they found considerable variety among scenarios ranging from variants of sustainable development to the collapse of social economic and environmental systems in the majority of studies the following relationships were found morita et al 2001 noted that these relationships were not proof of causation no strong patterns were found in the relationship between economic activity and ghg emissions economic growth was found to be compatible with increasing or decreasing ghg emissions in the latter case emissions growth is mediated by increased energy efficiency shifts to non fossil energy sources and or shifts to a post industrial service based economy in producing scenarios an important consideration is how social and economic development will progress in developing countries

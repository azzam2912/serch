pps signals are output by radio beacons frequency standards other types of precision oscillators and some gps receivers precision clocks are sometimes manufactured by interfacing a pps signal generator to processing equipment that aligns the pps signal to the utc second and converts it to a useful display atomic clocks usually have an external pps output although internally they may operate at 9 192 631 770 hz pps signals have an accuracy ranging from a 12 picoseconds to a few microseconds per second or 2 0 nanoseconds to a few milliseconds per day based on the resolution and accuracy of the device generating the signal pps signals are usually generated as a ttl signal capable of driving a 1 kilohm load some sources use line drivers in order to be capable of driving 50 ohm transmission lines because of the broad frequency contents a long transmission line can have significant impact on the shape of the pps signal due to dispersion and after delivery effects of the dielectric of the transmission line it is common to set t0 at the voltage level of the steepest slope of a pps signal pps signals are therefore notoriously unreliable when time transfer accuracies

the relativistic doppler effect is different from the non relativistic doppler effect as the equations include the time dilation effect of special relativity and do not involve the medium of propagation as a reference point they describe the total difference in observed frequencies and possess the required lorentz symmetry astronomers know of three sources of redshift blueshift doppler shifts gravitational redshifts due to light exiting a gravitational field and cosmological expansion where space itself stretches this article concerns itself only with doppler shifts relativistic doppler shift for the longitudinal case with source and receiver moving directly towards or away from each other is often derived as if it were the classical phenomenon but modified by the addition of a time dilation term this is the approach employed in first year physics or mechanics textbooks such as those by feynman or morin following this approach towards deriving the relativistic longitudinal doppler effect assume the receiver and the source are moving away from each other with a relative speed formula 1 as measured by an observer on the receiver or the source the sign convention adopted here is that formula 1 is negative if the receiver and the source are moving towards

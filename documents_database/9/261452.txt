the vanishing of the cotton tensor for is necessary and sufficient condition for the manifold to be conformally flat as with the weyl tensor for for the cotton tensor is identically zero the concept is named after mile cotton the proof of the classical result that for the vanishing of the cotton tensor is equivalent to the metric being conformally flat is given by eisenhart using a standard integrability argument this tensor density is uniquely characterized by its conformal properties coupled with the demand that it be differentiable for arbitrary metrics as shown by recently the study of three dimensional spaces is becoming of great interest because the cotton tensor restricts the relation between the ricci tensor and the energy momentum tensor of matter in the einstein equations and plays an important role in the hamiltonian formalism of general relativity in coordinates and denoting the ricci tensor by r and the scalar curvature by r the components of the cotton tensor are the cotton tensor can be regarded as a vector valued 2 form and for n 3 one can use the hodge star operator to convert this into a second order trace free tensor density sometimes called the cotton

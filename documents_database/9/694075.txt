in prokaryotes this process takes place in the cytoplasm with the transcription of many ribosome gene operons in eukaryotes it takes place both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleolus it involves the coordinated function of over 200 proteins in the synthesis and processing of the three prokaryotic or four eukaryotic rrnas as well as assembly of those rrnas with the ribosomal proteins most of the ribosomal proteins fall into various energy consuming enzyme families including atp dependent rna helicases aaa atpases gtpases and kinases about 60 of a cell s energy is spent on ribosome production and maintenance ribosome biogenesis is a very tightly regulated process and it is closely linked to other cellular activities like growth and division some have speculated that in the origin of life ribosome biogenesis predates cells and that genes and cells evolved to enhance the reproductive capacity of ribosomes ribosomes are the macromolecular machines that are responsible for mrna translation into proteins the eukaryotic ribosome also called the 80s ribosome is made up of two subunits the large 60s subunit which contains the 25s in plants or 28s in mammals 5 8s and 5s rrna and 46 ribosomal proteins and a small 40s

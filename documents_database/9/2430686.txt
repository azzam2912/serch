it was later found in other ciliates fungi ferns and bacteria after being deposited in sediments that compress into sedimentary rocks over millions of years a process known as diagenesis tetrahymanol is converted into the saturated hydrocarbon gammacerane gammacerane has been interpreted as a proxy for ancient water column stratification tetrahymanol is a pentacyclic triterpenoid molecule the triterpenoids are a class of molecules found in both bacteria and eukaryotes which largely make hopanols and sterols respectively the structures of these three classes of molecules are shown below cholesterol and diploptene are used as model sterol and hopanol structures respectively while diploptene and tetrahymanol broadly have similar structures the fifth ring on tetrahymanol is a cyclohexane rather than a cyclopentane all three of these molecular classes have structures that lend themselves to membrane rigidity and other still unknown physiological functions the similarity of tetrahymanol to the other classes of triterpenoid molecules allows it to substitute for hopanols and sterols in cell membranes the tetrahymanol structure can have multiple stereoisomers its chiral methyl and hydrogen substituents can switch enantiomers during diagenesis giving the molecule different properties with each isomer when gammacerane the diagenetic product of tetrahymanol is analyzed its isomers can be

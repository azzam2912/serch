the land was once held by the ferguson family of kilkerran and lies in the parish of kirkoswald south ayrshire scotland the loch became a reservoir in the 19th century this roughly oval shaped loch was about three miles to the south west of maybole the natural trap dike dam that held back its waters was the only possible outflow and several crevices in this barrier allowed excess water to escape so that during times of heavy rainfall several of these spouts carried water at the same time hence lochspouts the main exit was deepened to provide a water supply for a waulkmill and this significantly lowered the level of the water exposing the remnants of a crannog as stated sometime prior to 1879 the water level was lowered and a crannog was exposed within the loch that was now reduced to around two acres only dr r munro partly excavated the site in 1880 and it was shown to be of wood around 95 ft in internal diameter with a raised walkway running to the shore mainly roman iron age date finds were discovered along with some medieval pottery and other artifacts all the items found were donated to

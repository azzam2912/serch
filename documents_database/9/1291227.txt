typically the lower temperature range is used on metals such as aluminium and higher temperatures are used on metals such as low medium carbon steels the process avoids the changing of mechanical properties whilst allowing components to be worked metals typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed as a coefficient of thermal expansion induction heating is a non contact heating process which uses the principle of electromagnetism induction to produce heat in a work piece in this case thermal expansion is used in a mechanical application to fit parts over one another e g a bushing can be fitted over a shaft by making its inner diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the shaft then heating it until it fits over the shaft and allowing it to cool after it has been pushed over the shaft thus achieving a shrink fit by placing a conductive material into a strong alternating magnetic field electric current can be made to flow in the metal thereby creating heat due to the ir losses in the material the current generated flows predominantly in the surface layer the depth of this layer being

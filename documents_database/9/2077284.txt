the term is attributed to muller who observed that one crossover interferes with the coincident occurrence of another crossing over in the same pair of chromosomes and i have accordingly termed this phenomenon interference meiotic crossovers cos appear to be regulated to ensure that cos on the same chromosome are distributed far apart crossover interference in the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans meiotic double strand breaks dsbs outnumber cos thus not all dsbs are repaired by a recombination process es leading to cos the rtel 1 protein is required to prevent excess meiotic cos in rtel 1 mutants meiotic co recombination is significantly increased and crossover interference appears to be absent rtel1 likely acts by promoting synthesis dependent strand annealing which results in non crossover nco recombinants instead of cos see diagram normally about half of all dsbs are converted into ncos rtel 1 appears to enforce meiotic crossover interference by directing the repair of some dsbs towards ncos rather than cos in humans recombination rate increases with maternal age furthermore placement of female recombination events appears to become increasingly deregulated with maternal age with a larger fraction of events occurring within closer proximity to each other than would be expected

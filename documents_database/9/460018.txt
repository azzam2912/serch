it is of special interest in decision theory and for the bayesian interpretation of probability theory historically it arose as a variant of the necktie paradox the problem typically is introduced by formulating a hypothetical challenge of the following type it seems obvious that there is no point in switching envelopes as the situation is symmetric however because you stand to gain twice as much money if you switch while risking only a loss of half of what you currently have it is possible to argue that it is more beneficial to switch the problem is to show what is wrong with this argument basic setup you are given two indistinguishable envelopes each of which contains a positive sum of money one envelope contains twice as much as the other you may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains you pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead the switching argument now suppose you reason as follows the puzzle the puzzle is to find the flaw in the very compelling line of reasoning above this includes determining exactly why and under what conditions that step

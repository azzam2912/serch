a general model suggested that the rate of physical weathering of bedrock de dt can be represented as an exponential decline with soil thickness formula 1 where h is soil thickness m p mm year is the potential or maximum weathering rate of bedrock and k m is an empirical constant the reduction of weathering rate with thickening of soil is related to the exponential decrease of temperature amplitude with increasing depth below the soil surface and also the exponential decrease in average water penetration for freely drained soils parameters p and k are related to the climate and type of parent materials found the value of p ranges from 0 08 to 2 0 mm yr for sites in northern california and 0 05 0 14 mm yr for sites in southeastern australia meanwhile values of k do not vary significantly ranging from 2 to 4 m a number of landscape evolution models have adopted the so called humped model this model dates back to g k gilbert s report on the geology of the henry mountains 1877 gilbert reasoned that the weathering of bedrock was fastest under an intermediate thickness of soil and slower under exposed bedrock or

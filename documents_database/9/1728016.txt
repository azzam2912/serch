it is widely accepted that fuzzy sets are more suitable for representing preferences of criteria in decision making the type 1 owa operators have been proposed for this purpose the type 1 owa operators provides a technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via owa mechanism in soft decision making and data mining where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets the two definitions for type 1 owa operators are based on zadeh s extension principle and formula 1 cuts of fuzzy sets the two definitions lead to equivalent results let formula 2 be the set of fuzzy sets with domain of discourse formula 3 a type 1 owa operator is defined as follows given n linguistic weights formula 4 in the form of fuzzy sets defined on the domain of discourse formula 5 a type 1 owa operator is a mapping formula 6 such that where formula 10 and formula 11 is a permutation function such that formula 12 i e formula 13 is the formula 14th highest element in the set formula 15 using the alpha cuts of fuzzy sets given the n linguistic weights formula 16 in the form of fuzzy sets defined on

thus rewriting some data requires an already used portion of flash to be read updated and written to a new location together with initially erasing the new location if it was previously used at some point in time due to the way flash works much larger portions of flash must be erased and rewritten than actually required by the amount of new data this multiplying effect increases the number of writes required over the life of the ssd which shortens the time it can operate reliably the increased writes also consume bandwidth to the flash memory which reduces random write performance to the ssd many factors will affect the wa of an ssd some can be controlled by the user and some are a direct result of the data written to and usage of the ssd intel and siliconsystems acquired by western digital in 2009 used the term write amplification in their papers and publications as early as 2008 wa is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the host system without compression wa cannot drop below one using compression sandforce has claimed to achieve a write amplification of 0

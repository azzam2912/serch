it exists as the anhydrous salt ce so as well as a few hydrated forms ce so ho with x equal to 4 8 or 12 these salts are yellow to yellow orange solids that are moderately soluble in water and dilute acids its neutral solutions slowly decompose depositing the light yellow oxide ceo solutions of ceric sulfate have a strong yellow color the tetrahydrate loses water when heated to 180 200 c it is insoluble in glacial acetic acid and pure 96 ethanol it was historically produced by direct reaction of fine calcined cerium iv oxide and concentrated sulfuric acid yielding the tetrahydrate the ceric ion is a strong oxidizer especially under acidic conditions if ceric sulfate is added to dilute hydrochloric acid then elemental chlorine is formed albeit slowly with stronger reducing agents it reacts much faster for example with sulfite in acidic environments it reacts quickly and completely when ceric compounds are reduced so called cerous compounds are formed the reaction taking place is the cerous ion is colorless ceric sulfate is used in analytical chemistry for redox titration often together with a redox indicator a related compound is ceric ammonium sulfate the solubility of ce iv

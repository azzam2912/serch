the software is written using open cascade in c for the engine geometry topology viewers data management java for the gui and data are stored in extensible mark up language xml geomodeller has started to revolutionise the working practices data standards and products of a geological survey as a whole the software takes into account all structural geology data such as dip dip directions strike hingelines and axialtrace to build the geometry of geological units geomodeller utilizes a digital terrain model surface geological linework cross sections geophysical interpretation and drillhole borehole data to enable the geologist to construct cross sections or 3d models 3d geostatistical interpolation co kriging using all the data location of interface dip direction produces a 3d implicit function representing a solid model the model build may take in account if necessary a network of geologic faults the model could be represented by triangulated objects each corresponding to one of the geological units present geologists can draw the model in their sections to obtain a fence diagram the geologist can use their knowledge to add information in the 3d space until he obtain a right model in geological and mining or oil exploration applications seismic profiles as

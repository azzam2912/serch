accordingly thermal equilibrium between systems is a transitive relation two systems are said to be in the relation of thermal equilibrium if they are linked by a wall permeable only to heat and they do not change over time as a convenience of language systems are sometimes also said to be in a relation of thermal equilibrium if they are not linked so as to be able to transfer heat to each other but would still not do so even if they were connected by a wall permeable only to heat the physical meaning is expressed by maxwell in the words all heat is of the same kind another statement of the law is all diathermal walls are equivalent the law is important for the mathematical formulation of thermodynamics which needs the assertion that the relation of thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation this information is needed for a mathematical definition of temperature that will agree with the physical existence of valid thermometers a thermodynamic system is by definition in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that is to say there is no change in its observable state i e macrostate over time and no flows occur in it

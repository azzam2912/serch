its name is derived from the type locality in essex county massachusetts in the united states modern petrology identifies rocks according to mineralogical criteria utilising the iugs qapf diagram of streckeisen 1974 essexite is more formally known as nepheline monzodiorite or nepheline monzogabbro depending on the ratio of orthoclase to plagioclase and the abundance of nepheline in order to produce a magma composition suitable for forming essexite the partial melting of the source rocks must be restricted generally to less than 10 partial melting this favors producing a melt rich in large ion lithophile elements lile such as k ba rb cs sr the source melts of essexites contain more aluminium and alkali ions than available silica tetrahedra which is why essexites crystallise nepheline instead of plagicolase higher than normal potassium favors the production of orthoclase which is usually absent from most mafic igneous rocks essexite can be considered as an alkali gabbro or monzodiorite primarily composed of nepheline plagioclase with lesser amounts of alkali feldspar with mafic minerals composed of any of the following titanium augite pyroxene hornblende and biotite trace mineralogy may include magnetite ilmenite and accessory olivine potassium feldspar and an increase in the feldspathoid minerals essexite

it was invented in 1878 by the american astronomer samuel pierpont langley a bolometer consists of an absorptive element such as a thin layer of metal connected to a thermal reservoir a body of constant temperature through a thermal link the result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir the greater the absorbed power the higher the temperature the intrinsic thermal time constant which sets the speed of the detector is equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal conductance between the absorptive element and the reservoir the temperature change can be measured directly with an attached resistive thermometer or the resistance of the absorptive element itself can be used as a thermometer metal bolometers usually work without cooling they are produced from thin foils or metal films today most bolometers use semiconductor or superconductor absorptive elements rather than metals these devices can be operated at cryogenic temperatures enabling significantly greater sensitivity bolometers are directly sensitive to the energy left inside the absorber for this reason they can be used not only for ionizing particles and photons but also for non ionizing particles

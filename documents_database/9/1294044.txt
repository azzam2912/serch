the wings were sharply tapered with straight trailing edges which introduced sweepback on the leading edge two specially modified mikulin am 34rnf also written am 34frn liquid cooled v 12 engines provided the power via a non reducing gearbox which was used only to raise the thrust line and enable the use of shorter undercarriage legs cooling for the first prototype s engine used an evaporative system which dispensed with radiators and used condensers built into the surface of the wing centre section the second prototype was fitted with a conventional cooling system using ethylene glycol coolant and a retractable radiator flight trials started but soon showed that the evaporative cooling system was inadequate with both the engine and the wing centre section overheating ilyushin was also very aware of the vulnerability of the system to combat damage but he was ordered by guap to use this system further development was halted in 1939 and the i 21 designation was re used for the pashinin i 21 data from okb ilyushin

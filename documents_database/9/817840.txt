has a negative metacentric height and therefore takes on an angle of heel to either port or starboard when a vessel has negative metacentric height gm i e is in unstable equilibrium any external force applied to the vessel will cause it to start heeling as it heels the moment of inertia of the vessel s waterplane a plane intersecting the hull at the water s surface increases which increases the vessel s bm distance from the center of b uoyancy to the m etacenter since there is relatively little change in kb distance from the k eel to the center of b uoyancy of the vessel the km distance from k eel to the m etacenter of the vessel increases at some angle of heel say 10 km will increase sufficiently equal to kg distance from the keel to the center of gravity thus making gm of vessel equal to zero when this occurs the vessel goes to neutral equilibrium and the angle of heel at which it happens is called angle of loll in other words when an unstable vessel heels over towards a progressively increasing angle of heel at a certain angle of heel the center of

simd stands for single instruction multiple data many modern general purpose computer processors have some provisions for simd in the form of a group of registers and instructions to make use of them swar refers to the use of those registers and instructions as opposed to using specialized processing engines designed to be better at simd operations it also refers to the use of simd with general purpose registers and instructions that were not meant to do it at the time by way of various novel software tricks a swar architecture is one which includes instructions explicitly intended to perform parallel operations across data that is stored in the independent subwords or fields of a register a swar capable architecture is one which includes a set of instructions that is sufficient to allow data stored in these fields to be treated independently even though the architecture does not include instructions that are explicitly intended for that purpose an early example of a swar architecture was the intel pentium with mmx which implemented the mmx extension set the intel pentium by contrast did not include such instructions but could still act as a swar architecture through careful hand coding or compiler

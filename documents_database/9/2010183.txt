the process is widely used in industry particularly for pressure sensitive adhesives on thin substrates self adhesive labels coating is the application of a layer to a substrate in general in order for a thin uniform layer to be applied the application must be done at low or moderate viscosities in many cases this low viscosity is achieved by dissolving or dispersing the desired coating in a liquid such as water or a solvent but this then necessitates the subsequent removal of the liquid by for instance a drying process hot melt coating achieves this low to moderate viscosity by melting the desired material before applying it to the substrate the substrate and coated layer are then cooled generally by passing over a chilled roller there is no liquid to remove so the process is in principle much faster than water or solvent based equivalents the process has been used so extensively for the application of adhesive layers by slot die coating that the use of the term hot melt often implies slot die coating but hot melt methods have also been used for other coating processes such as metering rod or roller coating if the desired substrate is too

formally it is a quotient object in the category of locally small categories analogous to a quotient group or quotient space but in the categorical setting let c be a category a congruence relation r on c is given by for each pair of objects x y in c an equivalence relation r on hom x y such that the equivalence relations respect composition of morphisms that is if are related in hom x y and are related in hom y z then g f and g f are related in hom x z given a congruence relation r on c we can define the quotient category c r as the category whose objects are those of c and whose morphisms are equivalence classes of morphisms in c that is composition of morphisms in c r is well defined since r is a congruence relation there is a natural quotient functor from c to c r which sends each morphism to its equivalence class this functor is bijective on objects and surjective on hom sets i e it is a full functor every functor f c d determines a congruence on c by saying f g iff f f f

lngfr is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor tnf receptor superfamily indeed lngfr was the first member of this large family of receptors to be characterized neurotrophins include four proteins all of which bind to the lngfr nerve growth factor ngf brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf neurotrophin 3 nt 3 and neurotrophin 4 nt 4 nerve growth factor the prototypical growth factor is a protein secreted by a neuron s target ngf is critical for the survival and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons ngf is released from the target cells binds to and activates its high affinity receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase a trka and is internalized into the responsive neuron the ngf trka complex is subsequently trafficked back to the cell body this movement of ngf from axon tip to soma is thought to be involved in the long distance signaling of neurons the activation of trka by ngf is critical in inducing the survival and differentiation caused by this growth factor however ngf binds at least two receptors on the surface of cells that are capable of responding to this growth factor trka pronounced track a and the lngfr trka is a receptor tyrosine kinase meaning

intuitively such a cardinal represents a point beyond which initial pieces of the universe of sets start to look similar in the sense that each is elementarily embeddable into a later one for every ordinal a cardinal is called extendible if for some ordinal there is a nontrivial elementary embedding j of v into v where is the critical point of j and as usual v denotes the th level of the von neumann hierarchy a cardinal is called an extendible cardinal if it is extendible for every nonzero ordinal kanamori 2003 a cardinal is called c extendible if there is an elementary embedding j witnessing that is extendible that is j is elementary from v to some v with critical point such that furthermore v is correct in v that is for every formula holds in v if and only if holds in v a cardinal is said to be c extendible if it is c extendible for every ordinal every extendible cardinal is c extendible but for n 1 the least c extendible cardinal is never c extendible bagaria 2011 vop nka s principle implies the existence of extendible cardinals in fact vop nka s principle for definable

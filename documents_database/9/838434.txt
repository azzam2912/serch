al fawwar is basically a small grotto which is entered by going down a few steps where water is released from a few openings the spring is known for flowing sporadically with random time intervals the spring might not flow in days or even months loud sounds emitted from the underground would usually signal that the spring will flow and are heard minutes before the it starts flowing the water would usually keep on flowing for a few hours sometimes a day or two and the water would spread to smaller springs this phenomenon is explainable though the water at the opening traps the air and under high pressure the air pushes the water and causes this random strong flow of water people regard this event as a good sign of good luck and are always happy when this happens the spring is surrounded with many restaurants cafeterias and hotels thousands visit the al fawwar spring every year mainly tourists and visitors visiting the monastery this spring was called sabte during the reign of the roman emperor titus in syria

the most common back scatter applications are air traffic radar bistatic forward scatter guided missile and airplane detecting trip wire radar and the us space radar it is also a less common propagation mode used by radio amateurs airplane scatter itself had been discovered in 1930 but radio amateur usage lagged until the late 80s the advent of inexpensive sdr based and distributed real time flight tracking enabled precise scheduling increasing feasibility compared to a single trail of meteor scatter the time of opening caused by a single airplane is longer it can be from 30 seconds up to a few minutes slight asymmetry can sometimes be encountered both in terms of exact timing and the gain of the path range and possible contact lengths are affected by the size of the plane flight level and the approximate crossing time of the central part of the straight line between the two communicating stations both the onset and decay of the channel is rapid so to improve success rate a short contact procedure is used contact opportunities can be predicted based on the precise flight paths of surrounding planes there exist software solutions for prediction using local mode s and ads

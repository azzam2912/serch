the mrt was primarily designed to make a survey with a point source sensitivity of 150 mjy its resolution is about 4 arc min the mrt is a t shaped array consisting of a 2048m long east west arm with 1024 fixed helical antennas arranged in 32 groups and an 880m long north south arm of with 15 movable trolleys each containing four antennas there is a single trolley in the north arm the north south arm is built along the old port louis to flacq railway line which closed in 1964 the antennas collect radio waves and transform them into electric signals the signal from each group is filtered amplified and sent to the telescope building where it is digitized the digitized signals are processed in a correlator gnu linux os computers using custom software transform these correlated signals into raw images called dirty maps the mrt uses aperture synthesis to simulate a 1 km by 1 km filled array data is collected as the trolleys in the north south arm move southward from the array centre observations are repeated 62 times until the trolleys reach the southern end the arm the 1 d data for each day is

what all types of defects have in common whether surface or bulk defects is that they produce dangling bonds that have specific electron energy levels different from those of the bulk this difference occurs because these states cannot be described with periodic bloch waves due to the change in electron potential energy caused by the missing ion cores just outside the surface hence these are localized states that require separate solutions to the schr dinger equation so that electron energies can be properly described the break in periodicity results in a decrease in conductivity due to defect scattering a simpler and more qualitative way of determining dangling bond energy levels is with harrison diagrams metals have non directional bonding and a small debye length which due to their charged nature makes dangling bonds inconsequential if they can even be considered to exist semiconductors are dielectrics so electrons can feel and become trapped at defect energy states the energy levels of these states are determined by the atoms that make up the solid figure 1 shows the harisson diagram for the elemental semiconductor si from left to right s orbital and p orbital hybridization promotes sp bonding which when multiple sp

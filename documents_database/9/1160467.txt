these polymers consist of esters amides and anhydrides all of which are susceptible to hydrolysis thus ensuring the breakdown of the polymer in the body s watery milieu the oldest version of aspirin came from hippocrates in the fifth century bc while the latest version polyaspirin comes from uhrich s lab at rutgers university polyaspirine consists of anhydrides and esters that hydrolytically degrade into the active ingredient in aspirin salicylic acid her research was highlighted in aspirin the remarkable story of a wonder drug by diarmuid jeffreys although the polymer was originally designed for biodegradable sutures polyaspirin is now undergoing clinical trials as a material for a new type of cardiac stent this biodegradable stent controls the inflammation effects occurring after angioplasty called restenosis and disappears when no longer needed uhrich has collaborated with professor michael tchikindas in the rutgers food science department to investigate polyaspirin and other plant based polymers as a method for prevention of biofilm formation by microbes such as e coli and salmonella in food in 1997 uhrich first patented polyaspirin all of uhrich s inventions were originally licensed to polymerix corporation in 2000 to develop biodegradable polymerized drugs and now being licensed through rutgers the

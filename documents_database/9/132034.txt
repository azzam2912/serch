the process is the opposite of vasodilation the widening of blood vessels the process is particularly important in staunching hemorrhage and acute blood loss when blood vessels constrict the flow of blood is restricted or decreased thus retaining body heat or increasing vascular resistance this makes the skin turn paler because less blood reaches the surface reducing the radiation of heat on a larger level vasoconstriction is one mechanism by which the body regulates and maintains mean arterial pressure medications causing vasoconstriction also known as vasoconstrictors are one type of medicine used to raise blood pressure generalized vasoconstriction usually results in an increase in systemic blood pressure but it may also occur in specific tissues causing a localized reduction in blood flow the extent of vasoconstriction may be slight or severe depending on the substance or circumstance many vasoconstrictors also cause pupil dilation medications that cause vasoconstriction include antihistamines decongestants and stimulants severe vasoconstriction may result in symptoms of intermittent claudication the mechanism that leads to vasoconstriction results from the increased concentration of calcium ca ions within vascular smooth muscle cells however the specific mechanisms for generating an increased intracellular concentration of calcium depends on the vasoconstrictor smooth muscle cells

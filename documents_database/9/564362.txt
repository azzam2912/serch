where parallel circuits with different capacities exist between two points in a transmission grid for example an overhead line and an underground cable direct manipulation of the phase angle allows control of the division of power flow between the paths preventing overload quadrature boosters thus provide a means of relieving overloads on heavily laden circuits and re routing power via more favorable paths alternately where an interchange partner is intentionally causing significant inadvertent energy to flow through an unwilling interchange partner s system the unwilling partner may threaten to install a phase shifter to prevent such inadvertent energy with the unwilling partner s tactical objective being the improvement of its own system s stability at the expense of the other system s stability as power system stability hence reliability is really a regional or national strategic objective the threat to install a phase shifter is usually sufficient to cause the offending system to implement the required changes to its own system to greatly reduce or eliminate the inadvertent energy flowing through the offended system the capital cost of a quadrature booster can be high as much as four to six million gbp 6 9 million usd for a unit rated

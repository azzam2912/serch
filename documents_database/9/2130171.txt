in greek the prefix hexaconta means 60 and tetra means 4 the sum of any hexacontatetragon s interior angles is 11160 degrees the regular hexacontatetragon can be constructed as a truncated triacontadigon t 32 a twice truncated hexadecagon tt 16 a thrice truncated octagon ttt 8 a fourfold truncated square tttt 4 and a fivefold truncated digon one interior angle in a regular hexacontatetragon is 174 meaning that one exterior angle would be 5 the area of a regular hexacontatetragon is with and its inradius is the circumradius of a regular hexacontatetragon is since 64 2 a power of two a regular hexacontatetragon is constructible using a compass and straightedge as a truncated triacontadigon it can be constructed by an edge bisection of a regular triacontadigon the regular hexacontatetragon has dih dihedral symmetry order 128 represented by 64 lines of reflection dih has 6 dihedral subgroups dih dih dih dih dih and dih and 7 more cyclic symmetries z z z z z z and z with z representing n radian rotational symmetry these 13 symmetries generate 20 unique symmetries on the regular hexacontatetragon john conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the

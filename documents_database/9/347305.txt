the term was introduced by adam young and moti yung in the proceedings of advances in cryptology crypto 96 kleptography is a subfield of cryptovirology and is a natural extension of the theory of subliminal channels that was pioneered by gus simmons while at sandia national laboratory a kleptographic backdoor is synonymously referred to as an asymmetric backdoor kleptography encompasses secure and covert communications through cryptosystems and cryptographic protocols this is reminiscent of but not the same as steganography that studies covert communications through graphics video digital audio data and so forth a kleptographic attack is an attack which uses asymmetric cryptography to implement a cryptographic backdoor for example one such attack could be to subtly modify how the public and private key pairs are generated by the cryptosystem so that the private key could be derived from the public key using the attacker s private key in a well designed attack the outputs of the infected cryptosystem would be computationally indistinguishable from the outputs of the corresponding uninfected cryptosystem if the infected cryptosystem is a black box implementation such as a hardware security module a smartcard or a trusted platform module a successful attack could go completely unnoticed a

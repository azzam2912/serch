on a given punctured riemann surface virasoro conformal blocks form a particular basis of the space of solutions of the conformal ward identites zero point blocks on the torus are characters of representations of the virasoro algebra four point blocks on the sphere reduce to hypergeometric functions in special cases but are in general much more complicated in two dimensions as in other dimensions conformal blocks play an essential role in the conformal bootstrap approach to conformal field theory using operator product expansions opes an formula 1 point function on the sphere can be written as a combination of three point structure constants and universal quantities called formula 1 point conformal blocks given an formula 1 point function there are several types of conformal blocks depending on which opes are used in the case formula 4 there are three types of conformal blocks corresponding to three possible decompositions of the same four point function schematically these decompositions read where formula 6 are structure constants and formula 7 are conformal blocks the sums are over representations of the conformal algebra that appear in the cft s spectrum opes involve sums over the spectrum i e over representations and over states in

depending on the application considering or altering the passive dynamics of a powered system can have drastic effects on performance particularly energy economy stability and task bandwidth devices using no power source are considered passive and their behavior is fully described by their passive dynamics in some fields of robotics legged robotics in particular design and more relaxed control of passive dynamics has become a complementary or even alternative approach to joint positioning control methods developed through the 20th century additionally the passive dynamics of animals have been of interest to biomechanists and integrative biologists as these dynamics often underlie biological motions and couple with neuromechanical control particularly relevant fields for investigating and engineering passive dynamics include legged locomotion and manipulation the term and its principles were developed by tad mcgeer in the late 1980s while at simon fraser university in burnaby british columbia mcgeer showed that a human like frame can walk itself down a slope without requiring muscles or motors unlike traditional robots which expend energy by using motors to control every motion mcgeer s early passive dynamic machines relied only on gravity and the natural swinging of their limbs to move forward down a slope the original

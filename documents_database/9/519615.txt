soil inference system sinfers is the term proposed by mcbratney et al 2002 as a knowledge base to infer soil properties and populate the digital soil databases sinfers takes measurements with a given level of certainty and infers data that is not known with minimal uncertainties by means of logically linked predictive functions these predictive functions in a non spatial context are referred to as pedotransfer functions the basic assumption underlying sinfers is that if one knows or is able to predict the basic fundamental properties of a soil one should be able to infer all other physical and chemical properties using ptfs pedotransfer functions relate basic soil properties to other more difficult or expensive to measure soil properties by means of regression and various data mining tools crucial to the operation of sinfers are reliable inputs the ability to link basic soil information and the quantification of uncertainty during 2007 2009 grant tranter of the university of sydney australia in collaboration with jason morris of morris technical solutions usa completed a working prototype of sinfers this implementation of the sinfers concept uses jess to pattern match object representations of subsets of soil properties in working memory to the argument

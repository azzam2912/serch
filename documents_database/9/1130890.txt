fatty acid binding proteins fabps are a family of small highly conserved cytoplasmic proteins that bind long chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands fabps are thought to play roles in fatty acid uptake transport and metabolism fabp7 is expressed during development in radial glia by the activation of notch receptors reelin was shown to induce fabp7 expression in neural progenitor cells via notch 1 activation according to one study fabp7 binds dha with the highest affinity among all of the fabps fabp7 maps onto human chromosome 6q22 31 a schizophrenia linkage region corroborated by a meta analysis as of 2008 two studies have been conducted into fabp7 as a possible risk gene for schizophrenia with one that tested for only one snp showing negative and another with seven snps a positive result the effect of the gene in the latter study was stronger in males this study also linked fabp7 variation to weak prepulse inhibition in mice deficit in ppi is an endophenotypic trait observed in schizophrenia patients and their relatives

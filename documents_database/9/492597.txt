this white water soluble solid is the sodium salt of tungstic acid it is useful as a source of tungsten for chemical synthesis it is an intermediate in the conversion of tungsten ores to the metal sodium tungstate is obtained by digestion of tungsten ores the economically important representatives of which are tungstates in base illustrative is the extraction of sodium tunstate from wolframite scheelite is treated similarly using sodium carbonate sodium tungstate can also be produced by treating tungsten carbide with a mixture of sodium nitrate and sodium hydroxide in a fusion process which overcomes the high exothermicity of the reaction involved several polymorphs of sodium tungstate are known three at only one atmosphere pressure they feature tetrahedral orthotungstate dianions but differ in the packing motif the wo anion adopts a structure like sulfate so treatment of sodium tungstate with hydrochloric acid gives the trioxide this reaction can be reversed using aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide the dominant use of sodium tungstate is as an intermediate in the extraction of tungsten from its ores almost all of which are tungstates otherwise sodium tungstate has only niche applications in organic chemistry sodium tungstate is used as catalyst for epoxidation of

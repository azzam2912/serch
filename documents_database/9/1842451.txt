it grazes on kelp the small imperforate thin fragile shell has a globosely conoidal shape its sculpture consists of very finely spirally striated with 30 striations on the penultimate whorl and obscured on the body whorl by growth lines the colour is variable and typical the 2 apical whorls are white or pinkish white on the third whorl 2 purplish bands equidistant from the sutures arise the 4th whorl is wholly purplish black as is the body whorl in some shells these bands persist on to the last 2 whorls additional bands arise so that on the body whorl 5 distinct bands can be counted rarely additional minute bands can be seen between these principal bands in some cases the purple on the last whorl breaks up into irregular dashes the shells found at shagpoint are mostly light coloured some have almost a white ground colour with 5 separate distant bands others have a pinkish ground colour with darker markings between the principal bands whilst in some the bands on the body whorl are broken up into dots the spire is very short and contains five whorls the body whorl is very large rapidly descending the suture is distinctly marked

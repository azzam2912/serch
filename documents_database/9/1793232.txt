according to this hypothesis scientific progress occurs mainly by the accumulation of a mass of modest narrowly specialized intellectual contributions on this view major breakthroughs draw heavily upon a large body of minor and little known work without which the major advances could not happen the ortega hypothesis is widely held but a number of systematic studies of scientific citations have favored the opposing newton hypothesis which says that scientific progress is mostly the work of a relatively small number of great scientists after isaac newton s statement that he stood on the shoulders of giants the most important papers mostly cite other important papers by a small number of outstanding scientists suggesting that the breakthroughs do not actually draw heavily on a large body of minor work rather the pattern of citations suggests that most minor work draws heavily on a small number of outstanding papers and outstanding scientists even minor papers by the most eminent scientists are cited much more than papers by relatively unknown scientists and these elite scientists are clustered mostly in a small group of elite departments and universities the same pattern of disproportionate citation of a small number of scholars appears in fields as

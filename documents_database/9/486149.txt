however there could be countably many homoclinic orbits connecting one fixed point a weaker version of the theorem was originally conceived by henri poincar although he lacked a complete proof which was later given by the condition that the dynamical system be on the plane is necessary to the theorem on a torus for example it is possible to have a recurrent non periodic orbit in particular chaotic behaviour can only arise in continuous dynamical systems whose phase space has three or more dimensions however the theorem does not apply to discrete dynamical systems where chaotic behaviour can arise in two or even one dimensional systems one important implication is that a two dimensional continuous dynamical system cannot give rise to a strange attractor if a strange attractor c did exist in such a system then it could be enclosed in a closed and bounded subset of the phase space by making this subset small enough any nearby stationary points could be excluded but then the poincar bendixson theorem says that c is not a strange attractor at all it is either a limit cycle or it converges to a limit cycle

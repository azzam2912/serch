the term can refer to two different features one in a freely meandering river with a floodplain and the other in an entrenched river in a freely meandering river a slip off slope is characterized by a gentle slope composed of sand and pebbles on the inside convex bank of a meander loop across the channel from a cut bank or river cut cliff as water in a meandering river travels around a bend it moves in a secondary corkscrew like flow as it travels downstream in a pattern called helicoidal flow this phenomenon causes increased water velocity in the outside bend of the meander driving lateral bank erosion it is also responsible for slower water velocity on the inner bend of the meander this low velocity allows eroded sediments from the cut bank side to be deposited on the inner bank the deposition of material at the toe of a slip off slope often results in the formation of a point bar geologically the environment in which a slip off slope is deposited is considered to be one of low energy this continual process of erosion of the outer bank and deposition on the inside bank causes the migration

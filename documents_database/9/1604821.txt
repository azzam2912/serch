the system contains a wolf rayet wr star that is one of the most massive and most luminous stars known and is also a bright x ray source due to colliding winds with a less massive o class companion the wr 22 system contains two massive stars which orbit every 80 days the spectrum and luminosity are dominated by the primary which has a spectral type of wn7h indicating that it is a wr star on the nitrogen sequence but also with hydrogen lines in its spectrum the secondary is an o9 star which appears to have the spectral luminosity class of a giant star but the brightness of a main sequence star there is a shallow eclipse detectable when the primary passes in front of the secondary which would be classed as the secondary eclipse however no primary eclipse is detected which is believed to be due to the eccentricity of the system placing the stars further apart when the primary eclipse would occur the separation of the stars varies from over to less than this strongly constrains the possible inclinations of the system the masses of the two stars can be determined fairly accurately because wr 22 is

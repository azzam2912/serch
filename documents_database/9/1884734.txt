it can be generalized to arbitrarily but finitely many functions acting on arbitrarily many variables the riesz rearrangement inequality can be used to prove the p lya szeg inequality in the one dimensional case the inequality is first proved when the functions formula 8 formula 9 and formula 10 are characteristic functions of a finite unions of intervals then the inequality can be extended to characteristic functions of measurable sets to measurable functions taking a finite number of values and finally to nonnegative measurable functions in order to pass from the one dimensional case to the higher dimensional case the spherical rearrangement is approximated by steiner symmetrization for which the one dimensional argument applies directly by fubini s theorem in the case where any one of the three functions is a strictly symmetric decreasing function equality holds only when the other two functions are equal up to translation to their symmetric decreasing rearrangements

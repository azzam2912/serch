regular semigroups are one of the most studied classes of semigroups and their structure is particularly amenable to study via green s relations regular semigroups were introduced by j a green in his influential 1951 paper on the structure of semigroups this was also the paper in which green s relations were introduced the concept of regularity in a semigroup was adapted from an analogous condition for rings already considered by john von neumann it was green s study of regular semigroups which led him to define his celebrated relations according to a footnote in green 1951 the suggestion that the notion of regularity be applied to semigroups was first made by david rees the term inversive semigroup french demi groupe inversif was historically used as synonym in the papers of gabriel thierrin a student of paul dubreil in the 1950s and it is still used occasionally there are two equivalent ways in which to define a regular semigroup s to see the equivalence of these definitions first suppose that s is defined by 2 then b serves as the required x in 1 conversely if s is defined by 1 then xax is an inverse for a since a

a simple example of a parametric oscillator is a child pumping a playground swing by periodically standing and squatting to increase the size of the swing s oscillations the child s motions vary the moment of inertia of the swing as a pendulum the pump motions of the child must be at twice the frequency of the swing s oscillations examples of parameters that may be varied are the oscillator s resonance frequency formula 1 and damping formula 2 parametric oscillators are used in several areas of physics the classical varactor parametric oscillator consists of a semiconductor varactor diode connected to a resonant circuit or cavity resonator it is driven by varying the diode s capacitance by applying a varying bias voltage the circuit that varies the diode s capacitance is called the pump or driver in microwave electronics waveguide yag based parametric oscillators operate in the same fashion another important example is the optical parametric oscillator which converts an input laser light wave into two output waves of lower frequency formula 3 when operated at pump levels below oscillation the parametric oscillator can amplify a signal becoming a parametric amplifier paramp varactor parametric amplifiers have been developed as low

visually a substorm is seen as a sudden brightening and increased movement of auroral arcs substorms were first described in qualitative terms by kristian birkeland which he called polar elementary storms sydney chapman used the term substorm about 1960 which is now the standard term the morphology of aurora during a substorm was first described by syun ichi akasofu in 1964 using data collected during the international geophysical year substorms are distinct from geomagnetic storms in that the latter take place over a period of several days are observable from anywhere on earth inject a large number of ions into the outer radiation belt and occur once or twice a month during the maximum of the solar cycle and a few times a year during solar minimum substorms on the other hand take place over a period of a few hours are observable primarily at the polar regions do not inject many particles into the radiation belt and are relatively frequent often occurring only a few hours apart from each other substorms can be more intense and occur more frequently during a geomagnetic storm when one substorm may start before the previous one has completed the source of the magnetic

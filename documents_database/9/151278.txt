elements a b and c can be taken from any commutative ring with identity often taken to be the ring of real numbers resulting in the continuous heisenberg group or the ring of integers resulting in the discrete heisenberg group the continuous heisenberg group arises in the description of one dimensional quantum mechanical systems especially in the context of the stone von neumann theorem more generally one can consider heisenberg groups associated to n dimensional systems and most generally to any symplectic vector space in the three dimensional case the product of two heisenberg matrices is given by since the multiplication is not commutative the group is non abelian the neutral element of the heisenberg group is the identity matrix and inverses are given by the group is a subgroup of the 2 dimensional affine group aff 2 formula 2 acting on formula 6 corresponds to the affine transform formula 7 there are several prominent examples of the three dimensional case if are real numbers in the ring r then one has the continuous heisenberg group h r it is a nilpotent real lie group of dimension 3 in addition to the representation as real 3x3 matrices the continuous heisenberg

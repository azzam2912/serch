it has a complex life cycle including two intermediate hosts a copepod and a small fish the turbot scophthalmus maximus is found in the northern atlantic ocean the baltic sea and the mediterranean sea and b gregarius occurs in the same range the life cycle of b gregarius involves a definitive host the turbot or other large flat fish and two intermediate hosts a copepod and a small fish the adult tapeworm is an occupant of the turbot s gut it lays eggs which pass with the fish faeces out into the sea and which hatch into free swimming larvae the coracidium for development to proceed the coracidium must be swallowed by a copepod after which it develops into the infective stage the plerocercoid if the copepod is then eaten by a small fish such as a goby the plerocercoid survives in its digestive tract a turbot becomes infected when it swallows the infected small fish and this completes the life cycle of the parasite off the coast of france the plerocercoid larvae have been found in two species of goby pomatoschistus marmoratus and pomatoschistus minutus it seems that juvenile turbots feed on copepods but these crustaceans are too small

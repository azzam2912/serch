a stationary field is one that is in a steady state but the masses causing that field may be non static causing them to rotate for instance more generally the subject that deals with the effects caused by mass energy currents is known as gravitomagnetism which is analogous to classical electromagnetism the first frame dragging effect was derived in 1918 in the framework of general relativity by the austrian physicists josef lense and hans thirring and is also known as the lense thirring effect they predicted that the rotation of a massive object would distort the spacetime metric making the orbit of a nearby test particle precess this does not happen in newtonian mechanics for which the gravitational field of a body depends only on its mass not on its rotation the lense thirring effect is very small about one part in a few trillion to detect it it is necessary to examine a very massive object or build an instrument that is very sensitive in 2015 new general relativistic extensions of newtonian rotation laws were formulated to describe geometric dragging of frames which incorporates a newly discovered antidragging effect rotational frame dragging the lense thirring effect appears in the

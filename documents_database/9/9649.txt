pgp is used for signing encrypting and decrypting texts e mails files directories and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e mail communications phil zimmermann developed pgp in 1991 pgp and similar software follow the openpgp an open standard of pgp encryption software standard rfc 4880 for encrypting and decrypting data pgp encryption uses a serial combination of hashing data compression symmetric key cryptography and finally public key cryptography each step uses one of several supported algorithms each public key is bound to a username or an e mail address the first version of this system was generally known as a web of trust to contrast with the x 509 system which uses a hierarchical approach based on certificate authority and which was added to pgp implementations later current versions of pgp encryption include both options through an automated key management server a public key fingerprint is a shorter version of a public key from a fingerprint someone can get the right corresponding public key a fingerprint like c3a6 5e46 7b54 77df 3c4c 9790 4d22 b3ca 5b32 ff66 can be printed on a business card as pgp evolves versions that support newer features and algorithms are able

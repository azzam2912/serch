one key element of adaptive memory research is the notion that memory evolved to help survival by better retaining information that is fitness relevant one of the foundations of this method of studying memory is the relatively little adaptive value of a memory system that evolved merely to remember past events memory systems it is argued must use the past in some service of the present or the planning of the future another assumption under this model is that the evolved memory mechanisms are likely to be domain specific or sensitive to certain types of information a recent development in the field of evolutionary psychology adaptive memory was first proposed in 2007 by james s nairne sarah r thompson and josefa n s pandeirada evolutionary psychologists often state that humans possess a stone age brain therefore optimal cognitive performance may be found in problems faced by our ancestors or related to the environments in which our evolutionary ancestors lived based on this finding nairne and his colleagues proposed that human memory systems are tuned to information relevant to survival the first study on the subject of adaptive memory was published in 2007 and its methodology has been replicated many times

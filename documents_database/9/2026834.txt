throughout time it represented an aggregate genus many organisms were transferred to this genus and most monas spp have later been synonymised with or integrated in other genera the organisms once affiliated with monas spp truly belong to all major eukaryotic lineages opisthokonta amoebozoa rhizaria archaeplastida stramenopiles alveolata cryptophyta excavata and even to prokaryotic lineages the genus was also included in other groups as in mastigophora or flagellata the current practice is the questionable synonymous use based on morphological similarity of the generic names monas mostly used in the east asian literature and spumella synonymously used in the european and american literature as unpigmented biflagellates in chrysophyceae however there is a conflict between the morphological and molecular investigations the present day taxon monas spumella is still polyphyletic comprising at least three to five lineages and evidence about the identity of the type species of monas is missing this problem in the circumscription of groups using the practical morphological or taxonomic species concept or the biological species concept based on the degree of molecular similarity is also faced in the taxonomy of other microorganisms like other flagellates e g bodo cercomonas and microalgae e g chlorococcales

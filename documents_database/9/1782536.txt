where known these disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion there is no known cure for pch there are different signs and symptoms for different forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia at least six of which have been described by researchers all forms involve abnormal development of the brain leading to slow development movement problems and intellectual impairment the following values seem to be aberrant in children with cask gene defects lactate pyruvate 2 ketoglutaric acid adipic acid and suberic acid which seems to support the thesis that cask affects mitochondrial function pontocerebellar hypoplasia is caused by mutations in genes including vrk1 pch1 tsen2 tsen34 pch2 rars2 pch6 and tsen54 pch2 and pch4 the genes associated with pch3 and pch5 have not yet been identified the mutated genes in pch are autosomal recessive which means that parents of an affected child each carry only one copy of the damaged gene in each parent the other copy performs its proper function and they display no signs of pch a child inheriting two damaged copies of the gene will be affected by pch mutations in the genes that cause pch produce faults in the production of chemicals usually enzymes that are required for

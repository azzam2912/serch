the main type of volcanic edifice in the area are scoria cones it is formed by the la laguna jote and alumbrera volcanoes the first and last of these form a sub group which is better researched various dating methods have yielded ages from several million to several hundred thousand years ago but some vents appear to be of holocene age volcanic activity in the andes occurs in four regions the northern volcanic zone the central volcanic zone the southern volcanic zone and the austral volcanic zone the first three of these are found where the nazca plate subducts beneath the south america plate while the last zone occurs at the subduction zone of the antarctic plate the andean central volcanic zone runs along the western cordillera of the andes and along the altiplano during the neogene the position of this volcanic arc moved eastward and the arc became broader probably due to a change in the tilt of the slab of the nazca plate volcanic activity during this time was heavily influenced by local strike slip faults which acted to channel the magma flows about 7 million years ago tectonics and volcanic activity changed in the region probably in

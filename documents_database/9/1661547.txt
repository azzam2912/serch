the spatial relations expressed by the model are invariant to rotation translation and scaling transformations the matrix provides an approach for classifying geometry relations roughly speaking with a true false matrix domain there are 512 possible 2d topologic relations that can be grouped into binary classification schemes the english language contains about 10 schemes relations such as intersects touches and equals when testing two geometries against a scheme the result is a spatial predicate named by the scheme the model was developed by clementini and others based on the seminal works of egenhofer and others it has been used as a basis for standards of queries and assertions in geographic information systems gis and spatial databases the de 9im model is based on a 3 3 intersection matrix with the form where is the dimension of the intersection of the interior i boundary b and exterior e of geometries a and b the terms interior and boundary in this article are used in the sense used in algebraic topology and manifold theory not in the sense used in general topology for example the interior of a line segment is the line segment without its endpoints and its boundary is just

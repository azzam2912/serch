a standard choice for a sigmoid function is the logistic function shown in the first figure and defined by the formula special cases of the sigmoid function include the gompertz curve used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of x and the ogee curve used in the spillway of some dams sigmoid functions have domain of all real numbers with return value monotonically increasing most often from 0 to 1 or alternatively from 1 to 1 depending on convention a wide variety of sigmoid functions including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions have been used as the activation function of artificial neurons sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as cumulative distribution functions which go from 0 to 1 such as the integrals of the logistic distribution the normal distribution and student s t probability density functions a sigmoid function is a bounded differentiable real function that is defined for all real input values and has a non negative derivative at each point a sigmoid function and a sigmoid curve refer to the same object in general a sigmoid function is monotonic and has a first derivative which is bell shaped a sigmoid function is constrained by a

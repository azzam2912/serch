transversals play a role in establishing whether two other lines in the euclidean plane are parallel the intersections of a transversal with two lines create various types of pairs of angles consecutive interior angles corresponding angles and alternate angles by euclid s parallel postulate if the two lines are parallel consecutive interior angles are supplementary corresponding angles are equal and alternate angles are equal a transversal produces 8 angles as shown in the graph at the above left a transversal that cuts two parallel lines at right angles is called a perpendicular transversal in this case all 8 angles are right angles when the lines are parallel a case that is often considered a transversal produces several congruent and several supplementary angles some of these angle pairs have specific names and are discussed below corresponding angles alternate angles and consecutive angles corresponding angles are the four pairs of angles that two lines are parallel if and only if the two angles of any pair of corresponding angles of any transversal are congruent equal in measure note this follows directly from euclid s parallel postulate further if the angles of one pair are congruent then the angles of each of the

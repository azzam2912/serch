it states that after the addition of a compact operator or hilbert schmidt operator of arbitrarily small norm a bounded self adjoint operator or unitary operator on a hilbert space is conjugate by a unitary operator to a diagonal operator the results are subsumed in later generalizations for bounded normal operators due to david berg 1971 compact perturbation and dan virgil voiculescu 1979 hilbert schmidt perturbation the theorem and its generalizations were one of the starting points of operator k homology developed first by lawrence g brown ronald douglas and peter fillmore and in greater generality by gennadi kasparov in 1958 kuroda showed that the weyl von neumann theorem is also true if the hilbert schmidt class is replaced by any schatten class s with p 1 for s the trace class operators the situation is quite different the kato rosenblum theorem proved in 1957 using scattering theory states that if two bounded self adjoint operators differ by a trace class operator then their absolutely continuous parts are unitarily equivalent in particular if a self adjoint operator has absolutely continuous spectrum no perturbation of it by a trace class operator can be unitarily equivalent to a diagonal operator

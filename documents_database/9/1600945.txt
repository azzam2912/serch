two multiply connected folding domains of the neutral endopeptidase locus splicing of exons 1 2a or 2b to the common exon 3 composed of 24 exons of the human calla nep gene containing the active site it is known as peptidase family m13 neprilysin family clan ma e the gluzincins a faint but significant structural relationship of the metzincins to the thermolysin like enzymes zincin is the simplest descriptor of biological space the structure reveals two multiply connected folding domains which embrace a large central cavity containing the active site of the 5 indanyl ester prodrug candoxatril and differs from phosphoramidon n n 6 deoxy l mannopyranosyl oxy hydroxyphosphinyl l leucyl l tryptophan in several respects the structure of human neutral endopeptidase complexed with phosphoramidon is lost due to desolvation of the enzyme and ligand on formation of the complex candoxatril candoxatril is the first drug of its kind to be released for clinical trials regarding heart failure this is because candoxatril produces favorable haemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure it has been demonstrated that candoxatril is associated with a beneficial hemodynamic effect that is useful both in rest and exercise in several different studies candoxatril has been

perfectly orderable graphs form a special case of the perfect graphs and they include the chordal graphs comparability graphs and distance hereditary graphs however testing whether a graph is perfectly orderable is np complete the greedy coloring algorithm when applied to a given ordering of the vertices of a graph g considers the vertices of the graph in sequence and assigns each vertex its first available color the minimum excluded value for the set of colors used by its neighbors different vertex orderings may lead this algorithm to use different numbers of colors there is always an ordering that leads to an optimal coloring this is true for instance of the ordering determined from an optimal coloring by sorting the vertices by their color but it may be difficult to find the perfectly orderable graphs are defined to be the graphs for which there is an ordering that is optimal for the greedy algorithm not just for the graph itself but for all of its induced subgraphs more formally a graph g is said to be perfectly orderable if there exists an ordering of the vertices of g such that every induced subgraph of g is optimally colored by the

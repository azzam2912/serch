it is similar to the third order intercept point in electrical systems four wave mixing can be compared to the intermodulation distortion in standard electrical systems it is a parametric nonlinear process in that the energy of the incoming photons is conserved fwm is a phase sensitive process in that the efficiency of the process is strongly affected by phase matching conditions when three frequencies f f and f interact in a nonlinear medium they give rise to a fourth wavelength f which is formed by the scattering of the incident photons producing the fourth photon given inputs f f and f the nonlinear system will produce from calculations with the three input signals it is found that 12 interfering frequencies are produced three of which lie on one of original incoming frequencies note that these three frequencies which lie at the original incoming frequencies are typically attributed to self phase modulation and cross phase modulation and are naturally phase matched unlike fwm two common forms of four wave mixing are dubbed sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation in sum frequency generation three fields are input and the output is a new high frequency field at the sum of

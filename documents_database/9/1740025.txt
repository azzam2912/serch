in conventional practice the tread of the wheel rests on the head of the rail and bears the weight of the vehicle while the flange is used to keep the vehicle in the gauge of the track flange bearing frogs are a relatively recent development as a means to reduce maintenance costs associated with turnouts and diamonds where rails must cross one another flange bearing frogs have been used by street railways for more than 200 years as a means of reducing noise pollution in populated urban settings in 1995 robert willow filed a patent in the united states adapting this concept for use in mainline freight and passenger service the patent describes the technology as designed to support a railroad wheel to roll through the frog on its flange rather than requiring its tread to jump across a flangeway gap ramps are placed on either side of the frog to gradually transition the wheel load from the tread known as tread bearing loading mode to the flange known as flange bearing loading mode and to lift the wheel so that the tread is completely clear of the rail conventional frogs require a gap of almost in the running surface

it is named after danish physicist niels bohr as a synthetic element it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature all known isotopes of bohrium are extremely radioactive the most stable known isotope is bh with a half life of approximately 61 seconds though the unconfirmed bh may have a longer half life of about 690 seconds in the periodic table it is a d block transactinide element it is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 7 elements as the fifth member of the 6d series of transition metals chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier homologue to rhenium in group 7 the chemical properties of bohrium are characterized only partly but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements two groups claimed discovery of the element evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a soviet research team led by yuri oganessian in which targets of bismuth 209 and lead 208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of chromium 54 and manganese 55 respectively two activities one with a half life of one to two milliseconds and the other with an approximately

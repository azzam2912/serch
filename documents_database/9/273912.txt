for this reason it is also often referred to as the canterbury arch although it is visible in both otago and marlborough as well as in the canterbury region it is shown in an apparent arch of high white cloud in an otherwise clear blue sky over the southern alps and is accompanied by a strong hot northwesterly or northerly wind simply known as the nor wester closer to the canterbury coast some distance from the mountains of the southern alps it appears as a clear area of blue above the mountains with white cloud streaming to the east from it the phenomenon is similar to the chinook arch seen in the pacific regions of the united states and canada the nor west arch is a f hn cloud the northwesterly wind drives warm moist air from over the tasman sea and it is pushed up by the presence of the southern alps causing it to cool rapidly the area to the east of the divide is in the rain shadow of the alps much of the moisture is dumped on the west coast and is responsible for the temperate rainforests found there as the air passes over the alps

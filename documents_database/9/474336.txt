the amici prism consists of two triangular prisms in contact with the first typically being made from a medium dispersion crown glass and the second a higher dispersion flint glass light entering the first prism is refracted at the first air glass interface refracted again at the interface between the two prisms and then exits the second prism at near normal incidence the prism angles and materials are chosen such that one wavelength colour of light the centre wavelength exits the prism parallel to but offset from the entrance beam the prism assembly is thus a direct vision prism and is commonly used as such in hand held spectroscopes other wavelengths are deflected at angles depending on the glass dispersion of the materials looking at a light source through the prism thus shows the optical spectrum of the source by 1860 amici realized that one can join this type of prism back to back with a reflected copy of itself producing a three prism arrangement known as a double amici prism this doubling of the original prism increases the angular dispersion of the assembly and also has the useful property that the centre wavelength is refracted back into the direct

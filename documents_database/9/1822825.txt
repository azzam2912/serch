it is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 3 83 based upon an annual parallax shift of 22 33 mas as seen from earth it is located about 146 light years from the sun the system is moving closer to the sun with a radial velocity of about 15 km s the components of this system have been optically separated with the secondary lying about one arc second away from the primary they have an orbital period of 91 2 years and an eccentricity of 0 48 the semimajor axis is 0 73 arc seconds roughly the distance from the sun to neptune and the inclination of the orbital plane is 94 5 both components are main sequence stars the visual magnitude 4 04 primary has a stellar classification of b9 v while the secondary is of class a3 v and magnitude 5 60 in 1969 coronae borealis was confirmed to be variable with an amplitude of 0 05 magnitudes a year later it was confirmed to be a scuti variable with the earliest known spectral type in the class the observed variations were not strictly periodic but showed a characteristic timescale of 0 03

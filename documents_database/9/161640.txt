this makes iso 2022 a variable width encoding but a specific implementation does not have to implement all of the standard the conformance level and the supported character sets are defined by the implementation many languages or language families not based on the latin alphabet such as greek cyrillic arabic or hebrew have historically been represented on computers with different 8 bit extended ascii encodings written east asian languages specifically chinese japanese and korean use far more characters than can be represented in an 8 bit computer byte and were first represented on computers with language specific double byte encodings iso iec 2022 was developed as a technique to attack both of these problems to represent characters in multiple character sets within a single character encoding and to represent large character sets a second requirement of iso 2022 was that it should be compatible with 7 bit communication channels so even though iso 2022 is an 8 bit character set any 8 bit sequence can be reencoded to use only 7 bits without loss and normally only a small increase in size to represent multiple character sets the iso iec 2022 character encodings include escape sequences which indicate the character

he was born in boulder colorado and educated at the university of colorado and mit he wrote a ph d in diophantine approximation under j e littlewood and g h hardy at the university of cambridge completed in 1939 he had positions at mit and stanford before his appointment in 1950 at princeton university there he was involved in a series of collaborative works with kunihiko kodaira on the deformation of complex structures which had some influence on the theory of complex manifolds and algebraic geometry and the conception of moduli spaces he also was led to formulate the d bar neumann problem for the operator formula 1 see complex differential form in pde theory to extend hodge theory and the n dimensional cauchy riemann equations to the non compact case this is used to show existence theorems for holomorphic functions he later worked on pseudogroups and their deformation theory based on a fresh approach to overdetermined systems of pdes bypassing the cartan k hler ideas based on differential forms by making an intensive use of jets formulated at the level of various chain complexes this gives rise to what is now called spencer cohomology a subtle and difficult theory

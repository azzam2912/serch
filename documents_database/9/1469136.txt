the device usually consists of led lights that are embedded into the roadway alongside the crosswalk and are oriented to face oncoming traffic when a pedestrian approaches the crosswalk the system is activated and the led lights begin to flash simultaneously these lights are programmed to flash for a period of time that is sufficient for an average pedestrian to cross the concept for embedded pavement flashing light system was conceived by pilot michael harrison in santa rosa california in 1992 after a friend was involved in a pedestrian accident he based it on his experience with airport runway lights embedded in pavement there are two different types of embedded pavement flashing light systems passive and active these types differ on how the system is activated with a passive system the pedestrian activates the device merely by walking up to the crosswalk this is accomplished by using one of several motion detection devices these include microwave motion sensors video detection pressure plates or a light trip beam with an active system the device is usually activated by a button that a pedestrian pushes in order to cross these active systems are generally similar to lighted pedestrian signs at traffic intersections

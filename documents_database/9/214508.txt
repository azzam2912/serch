the replicator equation differs from other equations used to model replication such as the quasispecies equation in that it allows the fitness function to incorporate the distribution of the population types rather than setting the fitness of a particular type constant this important property allows the replicator equation to capture the essence of selection unlike the quasispecies equation the replicator equation does not incorporate mutation and so is not able to innovate new types or pure strategies the most general continuous form is given by the differential equation where formula 2 is the proportion of type formula 3 in the population formula 4 is the vector of the distribution of types in the population formula 5 is the fitness of type formula 6 which is dependent on the population and formula 7 is the average population fitness given by the weighted average of the fitness of the formula 8 types in the population since the elements of the population vector formula 9 sum to unity by definition the equation is defined on the n dimensional simplex the replicator equation assumes a uniform population distribution that is it does not incorporate population structure into the fitness the fitness landscape does incorporate

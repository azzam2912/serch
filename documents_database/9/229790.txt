wp morphology denies that morphemes are signs form content pairs instead inflections are stem modifications which serve as exponents of morphological feature sets the theory takes paradigms as a central notion instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word forms or to generate word forms from stems word based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms the major point behind this approach is that many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches the examples are usually drawn from fusional languages where a given piece of a word which a morpheme based theory would call an inflectional morpheme corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories for example third person plural morpheme based theories analyze such cases by associating a single morpheme with two categories item and process theories on the other hand often break down in cases like these because they all too often assume that there will be two separate rules here one for third person and the other for plural but the distinction between them turns out to be artificial word and paradigm approaches treat these as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules words

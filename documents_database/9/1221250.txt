the key examples are the matrix coefficients of the spherical principal series the irreducible representations appearing in the decomposition of the unitary representation of g on l g k in this case the commutant of g is generated by the algebra of biinvariant functions on g with respect to k acting by right convolution it is commutative if in addition g k is a symmetric space for example when g is a connected semisimple lie group with finite centre and k is a maximal compact subgroup the matrix coefficients of the spherical principal series describe precisely the spectrum of the corresponding c algebra generated by the biinvariant functions of compact support often called a hecke algebra the spectrum of the commutative banach algebra of biinvariant l functions is larger when g is a semisimple lie group with maximal compact subgroup k additional characters come from matrix coefficients of the complementary series obtained by analytic continuation of the spherical principal series zonal spherical functions have been explicitly determined for real semisimple groups by harish chandra for special linear groups they were independently discovered by israel gelfand and mark naimark for complex groups the theory simplifies significantly because g is the complexification

it is located in orsay france about 25 km southwest of paris the physics of condensed matter is addressed in all its diversity but the current activities can be loosely divided into three main topics each one involving about thirty permanent researchers topic 1 theoretical and experimental studies related to the properties of correlated fermions superconductivity magnetism metal insulator transition and so on topic 2 studies related to nanosciences broadly speaking they are approached from the point of view of fundamental properties and cover the situation when the size of an object becomes comparable to certain characteristic scales coherence length mean free path topic 3 studies of soft matter including biological systems topics range from complex systems to living tissues from liquid crystals to foams passing through polymers or granular systems these studies are often done at the interface with physical chemistry and biology the faculty but also the cnrs researchers are actively involved in various undergraduate and graduate courses and programs aimed at students of the orsay and paris universities and at students of engineering schools grandes coles the laboratory hosts a graduate program leading to a degree in solid state physics the physics of condensed matter master common

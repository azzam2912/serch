this is done through a series of activities for bringing together researchers from different groups creating resources for information dissemination and documentation and making other people aware of the potential of imprecise probability models the society was originally created to manage the series of international symposia on imprecise probabilities and their applications isipta the first isipta happened in 1999 in ghent belgium due to the success of the event a second edition took place in cornell united states in 2001 the society was then created in switzerland during the year of 2002 the first general meeting of the society happened during the third isipta in lugano switzerland the society is now concerned with many activities around the theme of imprecise probabilities imprecise probability is understood in a very wide sense it is used as a generic term to cover all mathematical models which measure chance or uncertainty without sharp numerical probabilities it includes both qualitative comparative probability partial preference orderings and quantitative models interval probabilities belief functions upper and lower previsions imprecise probability models are needed in inference problems where the relevant information is scarce vague or conflicting and in decision problems where preferences may also be incomplete

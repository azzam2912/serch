written between 1963 and 1967 treatise is a graphic musical score comprising 193 pages of lines symbols and various geometric or abstract shapes that largely eschew conventional musical notation implicit in the title is a reference to the philosophy of ludwig wittgenstein which was of particular inspiration to cardew in composing the work the score is not accompanied by any explicit instructions to the performers in how to perform the work or what sound producing means are to be used although the bottom of each page has two five line musical staves this is not apparently meant to suggest piano or other keyboard instrument s it is apparently only meant to indicate that the graphic elements are musical not purely artistic in character cardew worked on the composition from 1963 to 1967 although the score allows for absolute interpretive freedom no one interpretation will sound like another the work is not normally played spontaneously as cardew had previously suggested that performers devise in advance their own rules and methods for interpreting and performing the work there are however almost infinite possibilities for the interpretation of treatise that fall within the implications of the piece and general principles of experimental music

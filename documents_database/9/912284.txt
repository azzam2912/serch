the illusion is most readily evoked on regions of the body surface that have relatively poor spatial acuity such as the forearm a rapid sequence of taps delivered first near the wrist and then near the elbow creates the sensation of sequential taps hopping up the arm from the wrist towards the elbow although no physical stimulus was applied between the two actual stimulus locations similarly stimuli delivered first near the elbow then near the wrist evoke the illusory perception of taps hopping from elbow towards wrist the illusion was discovered by frank geldard and carl sherrick of princeton university in the early 1970s and further characterized by geldard 1982 and in many subsequent studies geldard and sherrick likened the perception to that of a rabbit hopping along the skin giving the phenomenon its name while the rabbit illusion has been most extensively studied in the tactile domain analogous sensory saltation illusions have been observed in audition and vision the word saltation refers to the leaping or jumping nature of the percept from the moment of its discovery the cutaneous rabbit illusion piqued the curiosity of researchers and many experiments investigating the effect have been conducted most of them on

it is named after solomon w golomb who constructed it with a non planar embedding as a unit distance graph that requires four colors in any graph coloring thus like the simpler moser spindle it provides a lower bound for the hadwiger nelson problem coloring the points of the euclidean plane so that each unit line segment has differently colored endpoints requires at least four colors the method of construction of the golomb graph as a unit distance graph by drawing an outer regular polygon connected to an inner twisted polygon or star polygon has also been used for unit distance representations of the petersen graph and of generalized petersen graphs as with the moser spindle the coordinates of the unit distance embedding of the golomb graph can be represented in the quadratic field formula 1 the fractional chromatic number of the golomb graph is 10 3 the fact that this number is at least this large follows from the fact that the graph has 10 vertices at most three of which can be in any independent set the fact that the number is at most this large follows from the fact that one can find 10 three vertex independent

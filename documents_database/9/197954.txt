an optimization problem is one of calculation of the extrema maxima minima or stationary points of an objective function over a set of unknown real variables and conditional to the satisfaction of a system of equalities and inequalities collectively termed constraints it is the sub field of mathematical optimization that deals with problems that are not linear a typical non convex problem is that of optimizing transportation costs by selection from a set of transportation methods one or more of which exhibit economies of scale with various connectivities and capacity constraints an example would be petroleum product transport given a selection or combination of pipeline rail tanker road tanker river barge or coastal tankship owing to economic batch size the cost functions may have discontinuities in addition to smooth changes in experimental science some simple data analysis such as fitting a spectrum with a sum of peaks of known location and shape but unknown magnitude can be done with linear methods but in general these problems also are nonlinear typically one has a theoretical model of the system under study with variable parameters in it and a model the experiment or experiments which may also have unknown parameters one tries

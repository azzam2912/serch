one of these languages determines canonical forms for the elements of the semigroup the other languages determine if two canonical forms represent elements that differ by multiplication by a generator formally let formula 1 be a semigroup and formula 2 be a finite set of generators then an automatic structure for formula 1 with respect to formula 2 consists of a regular language formula 5 over formula 2 such that every element of formula 1 has at least one representative in formula 5 and such that for each formula 9 the relation consisting of pairs formula 10 with formula 11 is regular the concept of an automatic semigroup was generalized from automatic groups by campbell et al 2001 unlike automatic groups see epstein et al 1992 a semigroup may have an automatic structure with respect to one generating set but not with respect to another however if an automatic semigroup has an identity then it has an automatic structure with respect to any generating set duncan et al 1999 like automatic groups automatic semigroups have word problem solvable in quadratic time kambites otto 2006 showed that it is undecidable whether an element of an automatic monoid possesses a right inverse

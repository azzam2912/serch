it was created in 1970 the ceremade is a research center where applications of mathematics to areas of scientific activity as diverse as economics finance image and signal processing data analysis and classification theory mathematical physics mechanics epidemiology and astronomy are studied our main goal is the mathematical analysis of these problems but also the numerical approach and the support to practical implementation in interaction with industry the applications to economics and finance are of course very important for the insertion of ceremade within universite paris dauphine and the much larger diversity of applications covered is crucial in order to maintain the position of ceremade as a center of excellence in applied mathematics the center has about 60 permanent members and is structured in 3 main research axes in alphabetical order 1 mathematics applied to economics and finance 2 nonlinear analysis image processing and scientific computating 3 probability and statistics these research axes are strongly tied one to another and several members belong to more than one of these research groups these axes do not at all constitute separate entities we can give as an example the synergies between calculus of variations and mathematics applied to economics or between probability

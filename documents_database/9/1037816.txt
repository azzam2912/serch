the node is a failure node if there is no method for solving p if all of the children of a node n conjoined by the same arc are success nodes then the node n is also a success node otherwise the node is a failure node an and or tree specifies only the search space for solving a problem different search strategies for searching the space are possible these include searching the tree depth first breadth first or best first using some measure of desirability of solutions the search strategy can be sequential searching or generating one node at a time or parallel searching or generating several nodes in parallel the methods used for generating and or trees are propositional logic programs without variables in the case of logic programs containing variables the solutions of conjoint sub problems must be compatible subject to this complication sequential and parallel search strategies for and or trees provide a computational model for executing logic programs and or trees can also be used to represent the search spaces for two person games the root node of such a tree represents the problem of one of the players winning the game starting from the

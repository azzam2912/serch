there were two variants planned airstrato explorer with a target flight ceiling of 18 000 m and airstrato pioneer with a target flight ceiling of 8000 m it was planned to carry a 45 kg payload consisting of surveillance equipment scientific instruments or additional battery pods for extended autonomy the first prototype maiden flight took place on february 28 2014 it was equipped with a fixed landing gear two more prototypes were constructed that lacked a landing gear instead arca opted for a pneumatic catapult as a launcher and landing skids and a recovery parachute for landing both prototypes performed take off and landing testing and low altitude flights airstrato was first presented by arca on february 10 2014 as an alternative to the stratospheric balloons that had been used before in missions involving the helen and stabilo programs and the high altitude flights for the exomars program although capable of carrying less payload than a helium or solar balloon the aircraft had a much lower cost per mission and could stay in the stratosphere for longer periods of time unlike a weather balloon that could not be steered and relied on wind forecasts to predict its trajectory the airstrato

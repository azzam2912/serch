it is commonly used to solve ordinary differential equations but is also used within multivariable calculus when multiplying through by an integrating factor allows an inexact differential to be made into an exact differential which can then be integrated to give a scalar field this is especially useful in thermodynamics where temperature becomes the integrating factor that makes entropy an exact differential an integrating factor is any expression that a differential equation is multiplied by to facilitate integration for example the nonlinear second order equation admits formula 2 as an integrating factor to integrate note that both sides of the equation may be expressed as derivatives by going backwards with the chain rule therefore where formula 6 is a constant this form may be more useful depending on application performing a separation of variables will give this is an implicit solution which involves a nonelementary integral this same method is used to solve the period of a simple pendulum integrating factors are useful for solving ordinary differential equations that can be expressed in the form the basic idea is to find some function sayformula 9 called the integrating factor which we can multiply through our differential equation in order to

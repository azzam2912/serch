it is usually seen in the terminal stages of acute head injury and may indicate imminent brain herniation it can also be seen after the intravenous administration of epinephrine and similar drugs it was first described in detail by american neurosurgeon harvey cushing in 1901 the cushing reflex classically presents as an increase in systolic and pulse pressure reduction of the heart rate bradycardia and irregular respiration it is caused by increased pressure inside the skull these symptoms can be indicative of insufficient blood flow to the brain ischemia as well as compression of arterioles in response to rising intracranial pressure icp respiratory cycles change in regularity and rate different patterns indicate a different location of the brain where the injury occurred the increase in ventilation is exhibited as an increase in rate rather than depth of ventilation so the cushing reflex is often associated with slow irregular breathing as a result of the now defective regulation of heart rate and blood pressure the physiologic response is decreased blood flow peripherally which can present as mayer waves these are simply pathologic waves seen in hr tracings i e arterial lines electrocardiograph ecg etc which reflect decreased intravascular blood flow this

this elementary charge is a fundamental physical constant to avoid confusion over its sign e is sometimes called the elementary positive charge from the 2019 redefinition of si base units that took effect on 20 may 2019 its value is exactly by definition of the coulomb in the centimetre gram second system of units cgs it is making the value of the elementary charge exact implies that the value of electric constant which was an exact value before is now subject to experimental determination had an exactly defined value until the 2019 si redefinition after which it has become a subject of experimental refinement with time the si committees cgpm cipm etc had long considered redefining the si units entirely in terms of physical constants so as to remove their dependence on physical artifacts such as the ipk for this to work it was necessary to fix the values of the physical constants robert a millikan s oil drop experiment first measured the magnitude of the elementary charge in 1909 in some natural unit systems such as the system of atomic units e functions as the unit of electric charge that is e is equal to 1 e in those

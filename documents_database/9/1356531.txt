separated from milk through the process of fractionation it is a functional compound and consists of several milk proteins which are biologically active the composition is approximately 54 lactoferrin and 41 lactoperoxidase with other active proteins such as cyastin c and high mobility group like proteins making up the remainder of the fraction mbp has been evaluated for safety and is intended for use as a dietary ingredient it is approved in japan as a functional food ingredient in tofu and natt active substances in the milk basic protein fraction promote bone formation and suppress bone resorption it has been found to decrease the formation of osteoclast pits which act to break down bone and release minerals for resorption into plasma mbp helps to reduce this process it also increases bone mineralization by stimulating proliferation of osteoblasts which are involved in collagen production and bone formation daily supplementation with 40 mg of mbp over 6 months has been shown to result in increased bone mineral density and lower urinary markers of bone resorption it has been found to have a role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis direct effects have been identified between mbp and strengthening of bones through

nolders are used in both high performance as well as in less critical aerodynamic applications in 1996 autocar attributed original use of the term to ferrari with other sources citing the nolder as having derived from formula one racing where ferrari has been prominent the formula one dictionary defines a nolder as a small upside down l shaped aerodynamic appendage generally positioned on the trailing edge of the rear wing to increase downforce at low speed the automotive dictionary defines it as a very small aerodynamic appendage that fits freely into an aileron profile to increase downforce without affecting drag resistance in the design of high performance vehicles a nolder of limited size can significantly increase or decrease the lift cz of a vehicle s aerodynamic profile nolders are also used in less high performance applications for example forcing an airflow separation alongside a vertical rear window to minimize debris accumulation e g with a small hatchback examples include the underside of the ferrari laferrari which features a nolder to assist with vehicle dynamics the ferrari 599 gto features prominent flanking aerodynamic fins or flying buttresses aside the rear window maximizing air flow to a linear rear nolder the ferrari

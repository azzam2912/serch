this notion is more commonly referred to as intellectual property though intellectual rights more aptly describes the nature of the protections afforded by most nations these rights are intended to protect ideas transformed into a consumable product such as works of literature computer programs trademarks inventions works of art and others both terms were used in europe during the 19th century as a means of distinguishing between two different views of intellectual protection intellectual property was generally used to advocate a belief that copyrights and patents should provide rights similar to physical property rights the term intellectual rights was used by those who felt that such protection should take the form of temporary limited grants although most modern copyright systems do not treat copyrighted or patented materials in the same way as real property the term intellectual property has gained prominence for more on this subject see intellectual property also at least three different kinds of capital and rights are involved all three capital terms predate the term intellectual capital which appears to be a 19th century artifact of early now discredited economic theory in 20th century europe also originated another more modern approach intended to sweep away the differences

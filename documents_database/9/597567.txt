this class of relays provided manufacturing and operating advantages over previous designs wire spring relays entered mass production in the early 1950s wire spring relays were the most suitable relays for logic and computing functions they were used extensively in markers which were special purpose computers used to route calls in crossbar switch central offices wire spring relays were primarily manufactured by the western electric company for use in electromechanical telephone exchanges in the bell system the design was licensed for use around the world and was commonplace in japan manufacturing of wire spring relays greatly declined in the late 20th century due to the introduction of digital electronic switching systems that used them in very small numbers a relay has two major parts the electromagnet and the contacts the electromagnet may have a resistance between 15 and 200 ohms and is often designed to operate satisfactorily at a common telephony voltage such as 24 or 48 volts the electromagnet can also be modified by the insertion of metallic slugs lumps to create a brief delay before pulling in the contacts slow operate or hold the contacts in place briefly after power is removed slow release a wire spring relay

its protein is 312 amino acids long and its cdna has 1214 base pairs the function of c16orf42 is unknown it is predicted to be a transmembrane protein however the cellular or subcellular membrane in which is resides is as well unknown c16orf42 can also be found in many other organisms including mammals and certain fungi and plants it is not found in bacteria c16orf42 is highly conserved in many of its orthologs especially its mammalian orthologs as high as 95 identity in rhesus monkeys it also has fairly high conservation in its more distant homologs 53 identity in corn for example it has one potential human paralog the protein egfl6 ortholog analysis c16orf42 is not expressed ubiquitously in humans it is most highly expressed in the ovary but not expressed at all in the blood and very little in the brain one microarray experiment suggested that malaria causes its expression in the blood but further experimentation is needed to support this claim its expression in tissues tends to remain constant when the tissue is diseased however a brief analysis of its orthologs show inconsistencies in tissue expression this could be due to a lack of research of this protein

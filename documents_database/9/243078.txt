longomontanus is of the variety of large lunar formations called a walled plain although it is actually more of a circular depression in the surface because of its location longomontanus appears distinctly oval in shape due to foreshortening to the southeast of longomontanus is the even larger formation clavius and to the east is maginus north of the rim is the irregular crater montanari which in turn is joined at its northern rim by wilhelm the wall of longomontanus is heavily worn and incised by past impacts and the rim is essentially level with the surrounding terrain the northern rim especially is impacted with multiple overlapping craterlets to the east of the rim is a semi circular ridge that has the appearance of an overlapped crater rim the crater floor of longomontanus is relatively flat with a low cluster of central peaks somewhat offset to the west by convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to longomontanus

this includes all digits except significance arithmetic is a set of approximate rules for roughly maintaining significance throughout a computation the more sophisticated scientific rules are known as propagation of uncertainty numbers are often rounded to avoid reporting insignificant figures for example it would create false precision to express a measurement as 12 34525 kg which has seven significant figures if the scales only measured to the nearest gram and gave a reading of 12 345 kg which has five significant figures numbers can also be rounded merely for simplicity rather than to indicate a given precision of measurement for example to make them faster to pronounce in news broadcasts or other things specifically the rules for identifying significant figures when writing or interpreting numbers are as follows zeros to the right of the significant figures are significant if and only if they are justified by the precision of their derivation for example 12 2300 may have six significant figures 1 2 2 3 0 and 0 the number 0 000122300 still has only six significant figures the zeros before the 1 are not significant in addition 120 00 has five significant figures since it has three trailing zeros in

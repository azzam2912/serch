opened in 1991 the roller coaster was designed by curtis d summers and constructed by the dinn corporation it was patterned after the coney island cyclone at coney island in new york city the psyclone featured eleven hills five high speed banked turns and a dark tunnel it also featured the only wooden roller coaster trains ever built by bolliger mabillard the ride sustained structural damage after the northridge earthquake in 1994 and though repaired to operate safely again the ride dynamics suffered greatly in regard to vehicle tracking major modifications happened including adding trim brakes that slowed the trains down to the point of making the trains crawl through each turn the heavy trains took their toll on the track structure and the coaster became very rough because of this ridership at the attraction had drastically declined in part because it earned a poor reputation among park visitors and also because ride operators at the ride were required to load a minimum of 17 passengers in the train prior to dispatch this policy was enforced to reduce the chances of the vehicles from stalling mid ride due to lack of momentum because of this policy during low attendance periods

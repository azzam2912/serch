although group conflict is one of the most complex phenomena studied by social scientists the history of the human race evidences a series of group level conflicts that have gained notoriety over the years for example from 1820 to 1945 it has been estimated that at least 59 million persons were killed during conflicts between groups of one type or another literature suggests that the number of fatalities nearly doubled between the years 1914 to 1964 as a result of further group conflict group conflict can be separated into two sub categories of conflict inter group conflict in which distinct groups of individuals are at odds with one another and intra group conflict in which select individuals that are part of the same group clash with one another although both forms of conflict have the ability to spiral upward in severity it has been noted that conflict present at the group level i e inter group rivalries is generally considered to be more powerful than conflict present at an individual level a phenomenon known as the discontinuity effect social psychology specifically the discontinuity effect of inter group conflict suggests that groups are generally even more competitive and aggressive than individuals

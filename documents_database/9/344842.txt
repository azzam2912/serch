induction loops are used for transmission and reception of communication signals or for detection of metal objects in metal detectors or vehicle presence indicators a common modern use for induction loops is to provide hearing assistance to hearing aid users an audio induction loop provides assistance to hearing aid users the system has one or more loops in the area in which a hearing aid user would be present many different configurations can be used depending on the application such an induction loop receiver is classically a very small iron cored inductor telecoil the system commonly uses an analog power amplifier matched to the low impedance of the transmission loop the transmission is normally direct rather than superimposed or modulated upon a carrier though multi channel systems have been implemented using modulation many hearing aids contain a telecoil which allows the user to receive and hear the magnetic field and remove the normal audio signal provided from the hearing aid microphone site these loops are often referred to as a hearing loop or audio induction loop since there is no tuning available as the telecoil directly picks up all audio frequency magnetic fields careful system design is required where more

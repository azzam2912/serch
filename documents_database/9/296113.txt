the corresponding equation is a relativistic wave equation called the proca equation the proca action and equation are named after romanian physicist alexandru proca the proca equation is involved in the standard model and describes there the three massive vector bosons i e the z and w bosons this article uses the metric signature and tensor index notation in the language of 4 vectors the field involved is a complex 4 potential formula 1 where formula 2 is a kind of generalized electric potential and formula 3 is a generalized magnetic potential the field formula 4 transforms like a complex four vector the lagrangian density is given by where formula 6 is the speed of light in vacuum formula 7 is the reduced planck constant and formula 8 is the 4 gradient the euler lagrange equation of motion for this case also called the proca equation is which is equivalent to the conjunction of with in the massive case which may be called a generalized lorenz gauge condition when formula 12 the equations reduce to maxwell s equations without charge or current the proca equation is closely related to the klein gordon equation because it is second order in space

most staffordshire figures from 1740 to 1900 were produced by small potteries and makers marks are generally absent most victorian figures 1837 to 1900 were designed to stand on a shelf or mantlepiece and are therefore only modelled and decorated where visible from the front and sides these are known as flatbacks figures were mainly made in staffordshire but also in other counties and scotland all these may loosely be termed staffordshire figures the figures described by the term are normally in earthenware though early ones may be stoneware and the more expensive porcelain figures by the larger potteries in staffordshire and elsewhere in england are not normally included under the term these reflected metropolitan and international styles and were more carefully modelled and painted for a period at the end of the 18th century the finest staffordshire figures attempted to compete in this market but gradually makers abandoned these attempts and settled for a larger mass market buying cheaper figures of the huge variety of figures produced the staffordshire dog figurine was the most ubiquitous especially as a pair of king charles spaniels for a mantelpiece once cheap staffordshire figures are extensively collected in the english speaking world and

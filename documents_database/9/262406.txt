it was introduced to supersede both g 721 which covered adpcm at 32 kbit s and g 723 which described adpcm for 24 and 40 kbit s g 726 also introduced a new 16 kbit s rate the four bit rates associated with g 726 are often referred to by the bit size of a sample which are 2 3 4 and 5 bits respectively the corresponding wide band codec based on the same technology is g 722 the most commonly used mode is 32 kbit s which doubles the usable network capacity by using half the rate of g 711 it is primarily used on international trunks in the phone network and is the standard codec used in dect wireless phone systems the principal application of 24 and 16 kbit s channels is for overload channels carrying voice in digital circuit multiplication equipment dcme the principal application of 40 kbit s channels is to carry data modem signals in dcme especially for modems operating at greater than 4800 bit s g 721 was introduced in 1984 while g 723 was introduced in 1988 they were folded into g 726 in 1990 g 727 was introduced at the same time

it is defined primarily as the unconsolidated weathered at least partly mineral material that has accumulated as consolidated rocks disintegrated in place it is a type of soil parent material which has formed in place of origin this distinguishes residuum from most other types of parent material parent material is classified by mode of transport parent material is one of the soil forming factors defined as unconsolidated organic and mineral materials in which soils form making parent material an important part of the soil forming process the other soil forming factors are climate organisms relief and time parent materials are classified by their mode of transport into a system these modes of transport are by wind aeloian water gravity colluvial ice glacial till lakes lacustrine oceans marine or in place non transported soils derived from residuum are called residual soils these soils are expected to be mineralogically similar to their underlying bedrock while residuum is similar to the term regolith it is more specific while regolith refers to all unconsolidated earth materials above the solid bed rock including transported sediments such as sand or alluvium residuum is strictly a non transported parent material however parent materials formed in place or

the film was shot in swansea and cardiff south wales in 2007 and was the first film to be produced by london based production company urban way productions ltd in june 2008 the film was awarded best uk feature film at the swansea life film festival in 2004 a home office survey revealed that there are 20 to 60 youngsters aged 16 to 24 living rough in each inner city in the uk they are responsible for vast levels of crime and in almost all cases they have come from broken homes and a history of abuse both physical and sexual most of the time inflicted on them by their own parents nikki 18 fled a sexually abusive homelife and a succession of foster families to live on the street there she met vincent 24 the product of heroin addicted parents together they spend their days trying to survive the perils of living rough and supporting their own drug addictions so here s my take on the feral generation i think andrew jones has pulled off a genuinely objective dispassionate study of an aspect of modern life about which it is very hard indeed to be either dispassionate or objective

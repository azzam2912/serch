first identified in hard clam mercenaria mercenaria it is thought to play an important role in cardiac activity regulation several fmrfamied related peptides are known regulating various cellular functions and possessing pharmacological actions such as anti opiate effects in mercenaria mercenaria fmrfamide has been isolated and demonstrated to increase both the force and frequency of the heartbeat through a biochemical pathway that is thought to involve the increase of cytoplasmic camp in the ventricular region fmrfamide is an important neuropeptide in several phyla such as insecta nematoda mollusca and annelida it is the most abundant neuropeptide in endocrine cells of insect alimentary tracts along with allatostatin and tachykinin families however the neuropeptide s function is not known generally the neuropeptide is encoded by several genes such as flp 1 through flp 22 in c elegans the common precursor of the farps is modified to yield many different neuropeptides all having the same fmrfamide sequence moreover these peptides are not functionally redundant in invertebrates the fmrfamide related peptides are known to affect heart rate blood pressure gut motility feeding behaviour and reproduction in vertebrates such as mice they are known to affect opioid receptors resulting in elicitation of naloxone sensitive antinociception

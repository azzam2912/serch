homologues of cd mpr are found in all eukaryotes the cd mpr is a type i transmembrane protein that is it has a single transmembrane domain with its c termini on the cytoplasmic side of lipid membranes with a relatively short cytoplasmic tail the extracytoplasmic lumenal m6p binding domain consists of 157 amino acid residues the cd mpr is approximately 46 kda in size and it both exists and functions as a dimer the cell surface receptor for insulin like growth factor 2 also functions as a cation independent mannose 6 phosphate receptor it consists of fifteen repeats homologous to the 157 residue cd m6pr domain two of which are responsible for binding to m6p both cd mprs and ci mprs are lectins that bind their m6p tagged cargo in the lumen of the golgi apparatus the cd mpr shows greatly enhanced binding to m6p in the presence of divalent cations such as manganese the mprs bound to their cargo are recognized by the gga family of clathrin adaptor proteins and accumulate in forming clathrin coated vesicles they are trafficked to the early endosome where in the relatively low ph environment of the endosome the mprs release their cargo the

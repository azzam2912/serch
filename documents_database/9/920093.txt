the riemann problem is very useful for the understanding of equations like euler conservation equations because all properties such as shocks and rarefaction waves appear as characteristics in the solution it also gives an exact solution to some complex nonlinear equations such as the euler equations in numerical analysis riemann problems appear in a natural way in finite volume methods for the solution of conservation law equations due to the discreteness of the grid for that it is widely used in computational fluid dynamics and in mhd simulations in these fields riemann problems are calculated using riemann solvers as a simple example we investigate the properties of the one dimensional riemann problem in gas dynamics the initial conditions are given by where x 0 separates two different states together with the linearised gas dynamic equations see gas dynamics for derivation where we can assume without loss of generality formula 3 we can now rewrite the above equations in a conservative form where and the index denotes the partial derivative with respect to the corresponding variable i e x or t the eigenvalues of the system are the characteristics of the system formula 6 they give the propagation speed of the

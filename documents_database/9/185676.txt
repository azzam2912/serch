most of these apply to partially ordered sets that are at least lattices but the concept can in fact reasonably be generalized to semilattices as well probably the most common type of distributivity is the one defined for lattices where the formation of binary suprema and infima provide the total operations of join formula 1 and meet formula 2 distributivity of these two operations is then expressed by requiring that the identity hold for all elements x y and z this distributivity law defines the class of distributive lattices note that this requirement can be rephrased by saying that binary meets preserve binary joins the above statement is known to be equivalent to its order dual such that one of these properties suffices to define distributivity for lattices typical examples of distributive lattice are totally ordered sets boolean algebras and heyting algebras every finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to a lattice of sets ordered by inclusion birkhoff s representation theorem a semilattice is partially ordered set with only one of the two lattice operations either a meet or a join semilattice given that there is only one binary operation distributivity obviously cannot be defined in the standard way nevertheless because

despite this league football was not played on anzac day for many years in 1959 for example when all vfl games were played on saturday afternoons anzac day also fell on a saturday and the entire round was postponed to the following saturday the first vfl matches played on anzac day occurred in 1960 after an act of parliament which lifted the previous restrictions on this activity the anzac day act required a donation of a portion of ticket sales to the rsl so the rsl was active in encouraging the vfl to play on the day the vfl was initially unenthusiastic and on anzac day tuesday in 1961 it scheduled smaller games at windy hill and punt road oval for the day the victorian football association attempted to capitalise on this and with the rsl s support it moved a marquee match between rivals sandringham and moorabbin to the melbourne cricket ground and put on a pre match spectacle on a similar scale to that of the afl s modern anzac day clash the crowd of just under 14 000 was similar in size to the vfa s largest sunday crowds at the time but still fell well short

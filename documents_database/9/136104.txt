it is a colorless crystal or white powder and is produced when quicklime calcium oxide is mixed or slaked with water it has many names including hydrated lime caustic lime builders lime slack lime cal or pickling lime calcium hydroxide is used in many applications including food preparation where it has been identified as e number e526 limewater is the common name for a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide calcium hydroxide is relatively insoluble in water with a solubility product k of 5 5 10 it is large enough that its solutions are basic according to the following reaction at ambient temperature calcium hydroxide portlandite dissolves in pure water to produce an alkaline solution with a ph of about 12 4 calcium hydroxide solutions can cause chemical burns at high ph value see common ion effect its solubility drastically decreases this behavior is relevant to cement pastes aqueous solutions of calcium hydroxide are called limewater and are medium strength bases that reacts with acids and can attack some metals such as aluminium amphoteric hydroxide dissolving at high ph while protecting other metals from corrosion such as iron and steel by passivation of their surface limewater turns milky in the presence

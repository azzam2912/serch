the need for considering composition series in the context of modules arises from the fact that many naturally occurring modules are not semisimple hence cannot be decomposed into a direct sum of simple modules a composition series of a module m is a finite increasing filtration of m by submodules such that the successive quotients are simple and serves as a replacement of the direct sum decomposition of m into its simple constituents a composition series may not exist and when it does it need not be unique nevertheless a group of results known under the general name jordan h lder theorem asserts that whenever composition series exist the isomorphism classes of simple pieces although perhaps not their location in the composition series in question and their multiplicities are uniquely determined composition series may thus be used to define invariants of finite groups and artinian modules a related but distinct concept is a chief series a composition series is a maximal subnormal series while a chief series is a maximal normal series if a group g has a normal subgroup n then the factor group g n may be formed and some aspects of the study of the structure of

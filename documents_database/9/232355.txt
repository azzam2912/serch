it is the sodium salt of the polyphosphate penta anion which is the conjugate base of triphosphoric acid it is produced on a large scale as a component of many domestic and industrial products especially detergents environmental problems associated with eutrophication are attributed to its widespread use sodium tripolyphosphate is produced by heating a stoichiometric mixture of disodium phosphate nahpo and monosodium phosphate nahpo under carefully controlled conditions in this way approximately 2 million tons are produced annually stpp is a colourless salt which exists both in anhydrous form and as the hexahydrate the anion can be described as the pentanionic chain opop o opo many related di tri and polyphosphates are known including the cyclic triphosphate po it binds strongly to metal cations as both a bidentate and tridentate chelating agent the majority of stpp is consumed as a component of commercial detergents it serves as a builder industrial jargon for a water softener in hard water water that contains high concentrations of mg and ca detergents are deactivated being a highly charged chelating agent tpp binds to dications tightly and prevents them from interfering with the sulfonate detergent stpp is a preservative for seafood meats poultry and animal

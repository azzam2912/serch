the cells are part of the visual system they are termed magnocellular since they are characterized by their relatively large size compared to parvocellular cells the full details of the flow of signaling from the eye to the visual cortex of the brain that result in the experience of vision are incompletely understood many aspects are subject to active controversy and the disruption of new evidence in the visual system signals mostly travel from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus lgn and then to the visual cortex in humans the lgn is normally described as having six distinctive layers the inner two layers 1 and 2 are magnocellular cell m cell layers while the outer four layers 3 4 5 and 6 are parvocellular cell p cell layers an additional set of neurons known as the koniocellular cell k cell layers are found ventral to each of the m cell and p cell layers these layers were named this way because cells in the m layers of the lgn are larger than cells in the p layers m cells in the lgn receive input from parasol ganglion cells which some neuroscientists call m cells and p cells receive input

fuel sometimes contains vanadium compounds or sulfates which can form compounds during combustion having a low melting point these liquid melted salts are strongly corrosive for stainless steel and other alloys normally inert against the corrosion and high temperatures other high temperature corrosions include high temperature oxidation sulfidation and carbonization high temperature oxidation and other corrosion types are commonly modelled using the deal grove model to account for diffusion and reaction processes two types of sulfate induced hot corrosion are generally distinguished type i takes place above the melting point of sodium sulfate and type ii occurs below the melting point of sodium sulfate but in the presence of small amounts of so in type i the protective oxide scale is dissolved by the molten salt sulfur is released from the salt and diffuses into the metal substrate forming discrete grey blue colored aluminum or chromium sulfides so that after the salt layer has been removed the steel cannot rebuild a new protective oxide layer alkali sulfates are formed from sulfur trioxide and sodium containing compounds as the formation of vanadates is preferred sulfates are formed only if the amount of alkali metals is higher than the corresponding amount of

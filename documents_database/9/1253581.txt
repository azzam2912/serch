the idea was initially used in the field of mechanical engineering but is now the basis for industrial mass production techniques the basis of austauschbau manufacture is that any quantity of part a produced at different times and in different places must match any quantity of a similarly produced part b without further finishing being required in short it is a system of common mandatory standard production tolerances and fits that are specified for components based on their function to comply with the standards special machines and tools are used that also meet precise tolerances in addition measurement tools and training are needed to ensure compliance with the guidelines both during manufacture and as part of quality control afterwards part of the principle is to design in as many standard parts as possible screws bolts etc right from the concept stage austauschbau has enabled the division of labour and specialisation in modern industry leading to economic mass production of complex machines tools and vehicles from about 1921 by order of the reich transport ministry rvm almost all goods wagons were marked with the name of their owner deutsche reichsbahn the name of a so called class district gattungsbezirk a wagon

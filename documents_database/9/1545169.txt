although a source of much discussion in the scientific community during the late 1990s intergalactic stars are now generally thought to have originated in galaxies like other stars but later expelled as the result of either colliding galaxies or of a multiple star system travelling too close to a supermassive black hole which are found at the center of many galaxies collectively intergalactic stars are referred to as the intracluster stellar population or ic population for short in the scientific literature the hypothesis that stars exist only in galaxies was disproven in 1997 with the discovery of intergalactic stars the first to be discovered were in the virgo cluster of galaxies where some one trillion are now surmised to exist the way these stars arise is still a mystery but several scientifically credible hypotheses have been suggested and published by astrophysicists the most common hypothesis is that the collision of two or more galaxies can toss some stars out into the vast empty regions of intergalactic space although stars normally reside within galaxies they can be expelled by gravitational forces when galaxies collide it is commonly believed that intergalactic stars may primarily have originated from extremely small galaxies since it

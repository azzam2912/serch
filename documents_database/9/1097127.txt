folk neomorphism encompasses the functions of both recrystallization and inversion which are geological processes that deal primarily with rock reformation the neomorphic process as it relates to geology and petrography is one of the many major processes that sustain both carbonate minerals and limestone neomorphism is largely held accountable for the metastability of aragonite and magnesium rich calcite and when conditions permit neomorphic reactions and interactions can result in texture loss and or feature deformation of affected rock formations the term recrystallization broadly refers to the many metamorphic processes that change the size and or shape of crystal formations and preserve the chemical composition and mineralogy of the original mineral because recrystallization accounts for the majority of all visible changes produced by neomorphism the terms neomorphism and recrystallization implicitly allude to each other and can therefore be used interchangeably under most circumstances in petrology there are two forms of recrystallization recrystallization by inversion and recrystallization by replacement inversion is a complex form of neomorphism in which the recrystallization process transforms polymorphs into different polymorphs polymorphs to be clear are minerals that differ from one another in their crystalline structures but are otherwise composed of identical quantities and types of elements

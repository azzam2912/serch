cancer drugs and therapies all have very low selective toxicity however with the help of nanotechnology and rna silencing new and better treatments may be on the horizon for certain forms of cancer the main obstacle in using rnai technology for the treatment of cancer is protecting the rnai it is very fragile quickly metabolized and it has to efficiently be delivered to the target cells in vivo this is why nanoparticles are being used the nanoparticles currently used in experimental trials are usually nanoplexes polyplexes lipoplexes or micelles these four major types of nanoparticles are all nonionic lipids nonionic lipids are safe nontoxic and biocompatible nanoplexes involve the nucleic acid rnai being associated with the particle or encapsulated by it polyplexes are core shell type nanoparticles lipoplexes are liposome structures characterized by a bilayer lipid membrane lastly micelles result from electrostatic interaction between nucleic acids and copolymers chemokines are used in the communication between cells in the case of ovarian clear cell carcinoma gro and its receptor have been found to be overexpressed this pro inflammatory cytokine when found in excess is involved in tumor cell migration invasion and eventually metastasis a modified nanoparticle with sirna is now being

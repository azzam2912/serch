the active complex is formed by interactions with the mapk fus3 the mapk kinase mapkk ste7 and the mapkk kinase ste11 after the induction of mating by an appropriate mating pheromone either a factor or factor ste5 and its associated proteins are recruited to the membrane ste4 helps to recruit ste5 ste4 is not required for the attachment of ste5 to the membrane membrane association depends on a pleckstrin homology domain as well as an amphipathic alpha helical domain in the amino terminus during mating fus3 mapk and ptc1 phosphatase compete to control 4 phosphorylation sites on the ste5 scaffold when all of 4 sites have been dephosphorylated by ptc1 fus3 is released and becomes active ste5 plays 2 main roles in the mating signal pathway ste5 oligomerization is very important for stable membrane recruitment in one model the activation of the pathway occurs at the same time that ste5 is converted from a less active closed form of ste5 to an active ste5 dimer that can bind to the beta gamma subunit of the heterotrimeric g protein and form a lattice for the mapk cascade to assemble on not only does ste5 contribute to propagation of the pheromone signal

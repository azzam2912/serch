it was a comedy panel game show similar to have i got news for you but focused on parodying the behaviour of politicians rounds included answering questions without using the words yes or no and finding reasons to disagree with policies proposed by the other team no matter how sensible the winning team was chosen each week by a vote of the studio audience the show was named after the 1960s theatre song if i ruled the world the show was presented by clive anderson team captains graeme garden and jeremy hardy were the blue and red party leaders with anderson quipping that there was no more of an official political difference between these two teams than existed between britain s major parties of the time i was supposed to be a labour politician and graeme was supposed to be a tory but we didn t have to stay completely in character if we wanted to sort of shamelessly do gags recounts hardy who affected the far more absurdly right wing of the two characters an extremely wealthy aristocrat disdainful toward the voters and infrequently heard to advocate a coup repeat guests included rebecca front andy hamilton tony hawks fred

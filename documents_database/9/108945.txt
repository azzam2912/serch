it was the second general election held that year the first year that two general elections were held in the same year since 1910 and the first time that two general elections were held less than a year apart from each other since the 1923 and 1924 elections which took place 10 months apart the election resulted in the labour party led by harold wilson winning a narrow majority of just 3 seats the election of february that year had produced an unexpected hung parliament coalition talks between the conservatives and other parties such as the liberals and the ulster unionists failed allowing labour leader harold wilson to form a minority government the october campaign was not as vigorous or exciting as the one in february despite continuing high inflation labour was able to boast that it had ended the miners strike which had dogged heath s premiership and had returned some stability the conservative party still led by edward heath released a manifesto promoting national unity however its chances of forming a government were hindered by the ulster unionist party refusing to take the conservative whip at westminster in response to the sunningdale agreement of 1973 at the election

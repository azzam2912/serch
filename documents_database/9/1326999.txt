it offers a safe alternative to manually racking circuit breakers which reduces the requirement for service personnel to wear a full body arc flash hazard suit for protection a circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit there are fixed and withdrawable circuit breakers an arc flash is a type of electrical explosion that results from a low impedance connection to ground or another voltage phase in an electrical system by permitting the automatic racking of the circuit breaker from a remote location the remote racking systems move service personnel outside the arc flash protection boundary thus reducing the need for a full body arc flash hazard suit a remote switch operator is used to remotely operate various types and styles of circuit breakers and controls when the remote racking system is used in conjunction with a remote switch operator the user can also operate trip and release the circuit breaker from a safe distance there are several designs of remote racking systems on the market and most include either a wired or wireless remote control the distance at which these can be used varies by

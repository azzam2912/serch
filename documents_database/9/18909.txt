it can be applied to a variety of types of spectroscopy including optical spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy ftir ft nirs nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging mrsi mass spectrometry and electron spin resonance spectroscopy there are several methods for measuring the temporal coherence of the light see field autocorrelation including the continuous wave michelson or fourier transform spectrometer and the pulsed fourier transform spectrograph which is more sensitive and has a much shorter sampling time than conventional spectroscopic techniques but is only applicable in a laboratory environment the term fourier transform spectroscopy reflects the fact that in all these techniques a fourier transform is required to turn the raw data into the actual spectrum and in many of the cases in optics involving interferometers is based on the wiener khinchin theorem one of the most basic tasks in spectroscopy is to characterize the spectrum of a light source how much light is emitted at each different wavelength the most straightforward way to measure a spectrum is to pass the light through a monochromator an instrument that blocks all of the light except the light at a certain wavelength the un blocked wavelength is set by a knob on

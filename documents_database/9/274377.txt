it is one of the three main fluorides of silver the others being silver subfluoride and silver ii fluoride agf has relatively few niche applications it has been employed as a fluorination and desilylation reagent in organic synthesis and in aqueous solution as a topical caries treatment in dentistry the hydrates of agf present as colourless while pure anhydrous samples are yellow high purity silver i fluoride can be produced by the heating of silver carbonate to 310 c under a hydrogen fluoride environment in a platinum tube laboratory routes to the compound typically avoid the use of gaseous hydrogen fluoride one method is the thermal decomposition of silver tetrafluoroborate in an alternative route silver i oxide is dissolved in concentrated aqueous hydrofluoric acid and the silver fluoride is precipitated out of the resulting solution by acetone the structure of agf has been determined by x ray diffraction at ambient temperature and pressure silver i fluoride exists as the polymorph agf i which adopts a cubic crystal system with space group fmm in the hermann mauguin notation the rock salt structure is adopted by the other silver monohalides the lattice parameter is 4 936 1 significantly lower than those of

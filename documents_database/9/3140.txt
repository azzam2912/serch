dh is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography traditionally secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical channel such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier the diffie hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel this key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher diffie hellman is used to secure a variety of internet services however research published in october 2015 suggests that the parameters in use for many dh internet applications at that time are not strong enough to prevent compromise by very well funded attackers such as the security services of large governments the scheme was first published by whitfield diffie and martin hellman in 1976 but in 1997 it was revealed that james h ellis clifford cocks and malcolm j williamson of gchq the british signals intelligence agency had previously in 1969 shown how public key cryptography could be achieved although diffie hellman key agreement itself is a non authenticated key agreement

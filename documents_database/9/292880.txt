it normally entails taking a piece of metal usually scrap and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted these sparks can be compared to a chart or to sparks from a known test sample to determine the classification spark testing also can be used to sort ferrous materials establishing the difference from one another by noting whether the spark is the same or different spark testing is used because it is quick easy and inexpensive moreover test samples do not have to be prepared in any way so often a piece of scrap is used the main disadvantage to spark testing is its inability to identify a material positively if positive identification is required chemical analysis must be used the spark comparison method also damages the material being tested at least slightly spark testing most often is used in tool rooms machine shops heat treating shops and foundries a bench grinder is usually used to create the sparks but sometimes this is not convenient so a portable grinder is used in either case the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity at least 23 m s 4500 surface feet per minute sfpm but should

the boundaries of its shape include a semicircle and two line segments arranged in a way that resembles a tomahawk a native american axe the same tool has also been called the shoemaker s knife but that name is more commonly used in geometry to refer to a different shape the arbelos a curvilinear triangle bounded by three mutually tangent semicircles the basic shape of a tomahawk consists of a semicircle the blade of the tomahawk with a line segment the length of the radius extending along the same line as the diameter of the semicircle the tip of which is the spike of the tomahawk and with another line segment of arbitrary length the handle of the tomahawk perpendicular to the diameter in order to make it into a physical tool its handle and spike may be thickened as long as the line segment along the handle continues to be part of the boundary of the shape unlike a related trisection using a carpenter s square the other side of the thickened handle does not need to be made parallel to this line segment in some sources a full circle rather than a semicircle is used or the tomahawk

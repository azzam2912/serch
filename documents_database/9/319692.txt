most of them relate to the similarity of the regular hexagonal honeycomb like patterns found in certain chemical compounds to the mesh structure commonly seen in real chicken wire polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or graphenes including fullerenes carbon nanotubes and graphite have a hexagonal structure that is often described as chicken wire like a hexagonal structure that is often described as chicken wire like can also be found in other types of chemical compounds such as the skeletal formula is a method to draw structural formulas of organic compounds where lines represent the chemical bonds and the vertices represent implicit carbon atoms this notation is sometimes jestingly called chicken wire notation chicken wire is sometimes used as a placeholder name for any organic compound similar to the use of the name john doe it is an old joke in chemistry to draw a polycyclic hexagonal chemical structure and call this fictional compound chickenwire by adding one or two simple chemical groups to this skeleton the compound can then be named following the official chemical naming convention examples are in computational chemistry a chicken wire model or chicken wire surface plot is a way to visualize molecular models by drawing the polygon

this liquid is a fluorinating reagent used for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds the compound is colourless older samples assume an orange colour dast converts alcohols to the corresponding alkyl fluorides as well as aldehydes and unhindered ketones to geminal difluorides carboxylic acids react no further than the acyl fluoride sulfur tetrafluoride effects the transformation coh cf dast is used in preference to the more classical gaseous sf since as a liquid it is more easily handled a slightly thermally more stable compound is morpho dast acid labile substrates are less likely to undergo rearrangement and elimination since dast is less prone to contamination with acids reaction temperatures are milder as well alcohols typically react at 78 c and ketones around 0 c dast is prepared by the reaction of diethylaminotrimethylsilane and sulfur tetrafluoride the original paper calls for trichlorofluoromethane freon 11 as a solvent a compound that has been banned under the montreal protocol and is no longer available as a commodity chemical diethyl ether is a green alternative that can be used with no decrease in yield because of the dangers involved in the preparation of dast glass etching possibility of exothermic events it is often purchased from

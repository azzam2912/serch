this construction described below is very similar to that of a quotient vector space it differs from analogous constructions of quotient groups and quotient rings by the fact that in these cases the subspace that is used for defining the quotient is not of the same nature as the ambient space that is the quotient of a group by a subgroup is not always a group and a quotient ring is the quotient of a ring by an ideal not a subring given a module a over a ring r and a submodule b of a the quotient space a b is defined by the equivalence relation for any a and b in a the elements of a b are the equivalence classes a a b b in b the addition operation on a b is defined for two equivalence classes as the equivalence class of the sum of two representatives from these classes and scalar multiplication of elements of a b by elements of r is defined similarly note that it has to be shown that these operations are well defined then a b becomes itself an r module called the quotient module in symbols a b a b

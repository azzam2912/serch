this period represents the dawn of aviation which was fraught with uncertainties and numerous paths to many possible worlds the book captures two main conclusions from this period the first order conclusion of this book is about what engineers know five case studies from the history of aeronautical engineering are used to argue engineering often demands its own scientific discoveries thus engineering should be understood as a knowledge generating activity that includes applied science but is not limited to applied science the second order conclusion of this book pertains to how engineers know by using the same case studies to reveal patterns in the nature of all engineering these patterns form an epistemology of engineering that may point the way to an engineering method as something distinct from scientific method walter vincenti ends the work with a general variation selection model for understanding the direction of technological innovation in human history the book is filled with numerous additional observations and stories told by a practitioner and instructor this may be why dr michael a jackson author of structured design and problem frames once concluded a keynote address to engineers with the statement read vincenti s book read it carefully read

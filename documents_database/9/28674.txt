this may interrupt a speaker during debate or anything else if the breach of the rules warrants it the point is resolved before business continues the point of order calls upon the chair to make a ruling the chair may rule on the point of order or submit it to the judgment of the assembly if the chair accepts the point of order it is said to be ruled well taken if not it is said to be ruled not well taken generally a point of order must be raised at the time the rules are broken or else it would be too late for example if a motion was made and discussion began on it it would be too late to raise a point of order that the motion was not seconded if such a motion was adopted without a second it remains valid and not having a second becomes irrelevant exceptions to the rule that a point of order must be raised at the time of violation include that a point of order may be raised at any time a motion was adopted in violation of the bylaws or applicable law in conflict with a previously adopted motion

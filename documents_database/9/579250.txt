its formation is triggered by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to an internal intrinsic or external extrinsic cell death stimulus stimuli can vary from dna damage and viral infection to developmental cues such as those leading to the degradation of a tadpole s tail in mammalian cells once cytochrome c is released it binds to the cytosolic protein apaf 1 to facilitate the formation of an apoptosome an early biochemical study suggests a two to one ratio of cytochrome c to apaf 1 for apoptosome formation however recent structural studies suggest the cytochrome c to apaf 1 ratio is one to one it has also been shown that the nucleotide datp as third component binds to apaf 1 however its exact role is still debated the mammalian apoptosome had never been crystallized but a human apaf 1 cytochrome c apoptosome has been imaged at lower 2 nm resolution by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy in 2002 revealing a heptameric wheel like particle with 7 fold symmetry recently a medium resolution 9 5 ngstr m structure of human apoptosome was also solved by cryo electron microscopy which allows unambiguous inference for positions of all the apaf 1

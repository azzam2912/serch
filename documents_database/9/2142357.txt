the algorithm is based around creating a relaxation for nonlinear functions of general form by superposing them with a quadratic of sufficient magnitude called such that the resulting superposition is enough to overcome the worst case scenario of non convexity of the original function since a quadratic has a diagonal hessian matrix this superposition essentially adds a number to all diagonal elements of the original hessian such that the resulting hessian is positive semidefinite thus the resulting relaxation is a convex function let a function formula 1 be a function of general non linear non convex structure defined in a finite box formula 2 then a convex underestimation relaxation formula 3 of this function can be constructed over formula 4 by superposing a sum of univariate quadratics each of sufficient magnitude to overcome the non convexity of formula 5 everywhere in formula 4 as follows formula 3 is called the formula 9 underestimator for general functional forms if all formula 10 are sufficiently large the new function formula 3 is convex everywhere in formula 4 thus local minimization of formula 3 yields a rigorous lower bound on the value of formula 5 in that domain there are numerous methods to

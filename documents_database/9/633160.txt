this achieved the decryption of messages in the german teleprinter cipher produced by the lorenz sz40 42 in line cipher machine both the cipher and the machines were called tunny by the codebreakers who named different german teleprinter ciphers after fish it was mainly an electro mechanical machine containing no more than a couple of dozen valves vacuum tubes and was the predecessor to the electronic colossus computer it was dubbed heath robinson by the wrens who operated it after cartoonist william heath robinson who drew immensely complicated mechanical devices for simple tasks similar to and somewhat predating rube goldberg in the usa the functional specification of the machine was produced by max newman the main engineering design was the work of frank morrell at the post office research station at dollis hill in north london with his colleague tommy flowers designing the combining unit dr c e wynn williams from the telecommunications research establishment at malvern produced the high speed electronic valve and relay counters construction started in january 1943 the prototype machine was delivered to bletchley park in june and was first used to help read current encrypted traffic soon afterwards as the robinson was a bit slow

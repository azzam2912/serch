the gnomon is the piece which needs to be added to a figurate number to transform it to the next bigger one for example the gnomon of the square number is the odd number of the general form 2 n 1 n 1 2 3 the square of size 8 composed of gnomons looks like this to transform from the n square the square of size n to the n 1 square one adjoins 2 n 1 elements one to the end of each row n elements one to the end of each column n elements and a single one to the corner for example when transforming the 7 square to the 8 square we add 15 elements these adjunctions are the 8s in the above figure this gnomonic technique also provides a proof that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n the figure illustrates in an acute isosceles triangle it is possible to draw a similar but smaller triangle one of whose sides is the base of the original triangle the gnomon of these two similar triangles is the triangle remaining when the smaller of the two similar isosceles triangles is removed from the larger one

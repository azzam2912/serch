it is common to use the lms color space when performing chromatic adaptation estimating the appearance of a sample under a different illuminant it s also useful in the study of color blindness when one or more cone types are defective typically colors to be adapted chromatically will be specified in a color space other than lms e g srgb the chromatic adaptation matrix in the diagonal von kries transform method however operates on tristimulus values in the lms color space since colors in most colorspaces can be transformed to the xyz color space only one additional transformation matrix is required for any color space to be adapted chromatically to transform colors from the xyz color space to the lms color space however many color adaption methods or color appearance models cams use matrices to convert to spaces other than lms and sometimes refer to them as lms or rgb or and apply a von kries like diagonal matrix in that space the cat matrices for some cams in terms of ciexyz coordinates are presented here the hunt and rlab color appearance models use the hunt pointer estevez transformation matrix m for conversion from cie xyz to lms this is

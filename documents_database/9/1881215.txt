it uses a combination of the energy momentum and continuity equations to determine water depth with a given a friction slope formula 1 channel slope formula 2 channel geometry and also a given flow rate in practice this technique is widely used through the computer program hec ras developed by the us army corps of engineers hydrologic engineering center hec the energy equation used for open channel flow computations is a simplification of the bernoulli equation see bernoulli principle which takes into account pressure head elevation head and velocity head note energy and head are synonymous in fluid dynamics see pressure head for more details in open channels it is assumed that changes in atmospheric pressure are negligible therefore the pressure head term used in bernoulli s equation is eliminated the resulting energy equation is shown below for a given flow rate and channel geometry there is a relationship between flow depth and total energy this is illustrated below in the plot of energy vs flow depth widely known as an e y diagram in this plot the depth where the minimum energy occurs is known as the critical depth consequently this depth corresponds to a froude number formula 4

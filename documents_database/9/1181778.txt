it was discovered on 31 august 1954 by german astronomer karl reinmuth at heidelberg observatory in southern germany the asteroid was named after heidelberg astronomer gerhard klare the presumably stony asteroid orbits the sun in the central main belt at a distance of 2 4 3 0 au once every 4 years and 5 months 1 600 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 11 and an inclination of 4 with respect to the ecliptic first identified as at uccle observatory in 1934 klare s observation arc begins 20 years prior to its official discovery observation klare has been the subject of multiple photometric lightcurve studies which gave a well determined rotation period between 4 741 and 4 744 hours with a brightness variation between 0 70 and 0 90 magnitude measurements have also been used as the basis for generating a three dimensional model of its shape the collaborative asteroid lightcurve link call adopts a period 4 744 hours with an amplitude of 0 70 magnitude according to the survey carried out by the japanese akari satellite klare measures 14 69 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0 167 while call assumes an albedo

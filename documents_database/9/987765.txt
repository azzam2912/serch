it consists of many small vesicles and is present in growing hyphal tips during spore germination and where branch formation occurs its position in the hyphal tip correlates with the direction of hyphal growth the spitzenk rper is a part of the endomembrane system in fungi the vesicles are organized around a central area that contains a dense meshwork of microfilaments polysomes are often found closely to the posterior boundary of the spitzenk rper core within the ascomycota microtubules extend into and often through the spitzenk rper and within the ascomycota woronin bodies are found in the apical region near the spitzenk rper the cytoplasm of the extreme apex is occupied almost exclusively by secretory vesicles in the higher fungi ascomycota and basidiomycota secretory vesicles are arranged into a dense spherical aggregation called the spitzenk rper or apical body the spitzenk rper may be seen in growing hyphae even with a light microscope hyphae of the oomycota and some lower eumycota notably the zygomycota do not contain a recognizable spitzenk rper and the vesicles are instead distributed more loosely often in a crescent shaped arrangement beneath the apical plasma membrane

ballistic tables are used in hunting sport shooting military and scientific applications corrections in ballistic tables are given relative to a zero range ballistic charts are often given in angular measurements with units in either milliradians mil or minutes of arc moa the tables are usually generated using computer programs built on mathematical functions the number of inputs to the ballistic calculator can sometimes vary depended on the specific generator or the user may choose to only input certain variables for example a very simple drop table can be made using inputs for the sight adjustment value in mil or moa the zero range intended target ranges muzzle velocity caliber ballistic coefficient and bullet weight some of the environmental effects that play a role in calculating the trajectory are gravity projectile spin wind temperature air pressure and humidity more advanced tables can take more factors into account to ensure a more accurate prediction of the trajectory which becomes increasingly important on longer ranges some of these variables may have a negligible effect on shorter ranges

in particular the sets must have the form p p 2 p 6 or p p 4 p 6 with the exceptions of 2 3 5 and 3 5 7 this is the closest possible grouping of three prime numbers since one of every three sequential odd numbers is a multiple of three and hence not prime except for 3 itself the first prime triplets are a prime triplet contains a pair of twin primes p and p 2 or p 4 and p 6 a pair of cousin primes p and p 4 or p 2 and p 6 and a pair of sexy primes p and p 6 a prime can be a member of up to three prime triplets for example 103 is a member of 97 101 103 101 103 107 and 103 107 109 when this happens the five involved primes form a prime quintuplet a prime quadruplet p p 2 p 6 p 8 contains two overlapping prime triplets p p 2 p 6 and p 2 p 6 p 8 similarly to the twin prime conjecture it is conjectured that there are infinitely many prime triplets the first known gigantic prime triplet was

this project was the reference implementation of jsr 292 supporting dynamically typed languages on the java platform prior to java 7 the java virtual machine had no built in support for dynamically typed languages jsr 292 supporting dynamically typed languages on the java platform proposes to following the success of the jruby java implementation the da vinci project was started at the end of january 2008 the capabilities experimented by da vinci were planned to be added to java 7 it aims to prototype this jsr but also other lower priority extensions the first working prototype developed as a patch on openjdk was announced and made available on end of august 2008 since then the jruby team has successfully wired dynamic invocation in their codebase dynamic invocation shipped with the 1 1 5 release and will be disabled on jvms without codice 1 capabilities since then the project has been integrated in the jdk 7 codebase and then integrated in the java 7 release dynamic invocation is built on the fact that even if java is a strongly static language at the language level the type information is much less prevalent at the bytecode level however dynamic languages implementations need

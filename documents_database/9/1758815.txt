both the iupac and chemical abstracts service cas make similar naming recommendations for the naming of polymers the terms polymer and macromolecule do not mean the same thing a polymer is a substance composed of macromolecules the latter usually have a range of molar masses unit g mol the distributions of which are indicated by dispersity it is defined as the ratio of the mass average molar mass m to the number average molar mass m i e m m symbols for physical quantities or variables are in italic font but those representing units or labels are in roman font polymer nomenclature usually applies to idealized representations meaning minor structural irregularities are ignored a polymer can be named in one of two ways source based nomenclature can be used when the monomer can be identified alternatively more explicit structure based nomenclature can be used when the polymer structure is proven where there is no confusion some traditional names are also acceptable whatever method is used all polymer names have the prefix poly followed by enclosing marks around the rest of the name the marks are used in the order locants indicate the position of structural features e g poly 4

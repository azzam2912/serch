this occurs due to differential pressures of natural selection on populations from different environments for example populations of a species that lives within a wide range of temperatures may be locally adapted to the warmer or cooler climate where they live more formally a population is said to be locally adapted if organisms in that population have differentially evolved as compared to other populations within their species in response to selective pressures imposed by some aspect of their local environment local adaptation is often determined via reciprocal transplant experiments where organisms from one population are transplanted into another population and vice versa and their fitnesses measured if the foreign transplanted organisms have lower fitness than the native organisms in an environment then the native population can be said to be locally adapted populations located in different environments may be faced with different biotic and abiotic pressures consequently natural selection may drive the evolution of these populations in different directions this divergent natural selection can lead to differences in trait values among populations for those traits that are heritable and impact organism fitness local adaptation of a variety of traits has been demonstrated in numerous phylogenetically disparate organisms examples of local

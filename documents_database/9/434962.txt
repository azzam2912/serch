it is a generalization of a linear anosov diffeomorphism of the torus its definition relies on the notion of a measured foliation introduced by william thurston who also coined the term pseudo anosov diffeomorphism when he proved his classification of diffeomorphisms of a surface a measured foliation f on a closed surface s is a geometric structure on s which consists of a singular foliation and a measure in the transverse direction in some neighborhood of a regular point of f there is a flow box u r which sends the leaves of f to the horizontal lines in r if two such neighborhoods u and u overlap then there is a transition function defined on u with the standard property which must have the form for some constant c this assures that along a simple curve the variation in y coordinate measured locally in every chart is a geometric quantity i e independent of the chart and permits the definition of a total variation along a simple closed curve on s a finite number of singularities of f of the type of p pronged saddle p 3 are allowed at such a singular point the differentiable structure of the

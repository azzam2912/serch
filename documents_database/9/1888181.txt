in humans this gene is located on chromosome 1 p34 3 the human mrna transcript is 2527 base pairs and the final protein product is 756 amino acids while the exact function of this protein remains unknown due to the presence of three sh3 domains it has been implicated in protein protein interactions sh3d21 is expressed in low levels in most tissue microarray analysis has shown sh3d21 expression to be decreased in tp63 knockout mice sh3d21 has been shown to be expressed highly in the superior cervical ganglion the dorsal root ganglia and the trigeminal ganglion transcription of sh3d21 is known to be upregulated in the presence of testosterone sh3d21 contains three sh3 domains these domains are located near the n terminus of the protein in humans these sh3 domains have a common amino acid sequence asp glu leu this sequence motif is also conserved in other species sh3d21 has been found to interact with adenylate kinase 2 artemin and importin 13 the human protein has two isoforms and no paralogs the second isoform is 645 amino acids long and is identical to the first isoform except it is missing the first 111 amino acids due to this the second

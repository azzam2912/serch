they are seed eating birds with stubby conical bills the family emberizidae was formerly much larger and included the species now placed in the passerellidae new world sparrows and calcariidae longspurs and snow buntings molecular phylogenetic studies found that the large family consisted of distinct clades that were better treated as separate families the genus emberiza is now the only genus placed in the family emberizidae the genus was introduced by the swedish naturalist carl linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his systema naturae the type species was subsequently designated as the yellowhammer emberiza citrinella the genus name emberiza is from old german embritz a bunting the origin of english bunting is unknown a 2008 genetic study found that three emberizid species that were placed in their own monotypic genera clustered within the emberiza these were the crested bunting melophus lathami the slaty bunting latouchiornis siemsseni and the corn bunting miliaria calandra all three species are now included in the genus emberiza a large dna based study of the passerines published in 2019 found that the buntings are most closely related to the longspurs and snow buntings in the family calcariidae ornithologists edward dickinson and leslie christidis in

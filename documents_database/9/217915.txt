the x ray periods range from as little as a fraction of a second to as much as several minutes an x ray pulsar consists of a magnetized neutron star in orbit with a normal stellar companion and is a type of binary star system the magnetic field strength at the surface of the neutron star is typically about 10 tesla over a trillion times stronger than the strength of the magnetic field measured at the surface of the earth 60 t gas is accreted from the stellar companion and is channeled by the neutron star s magnetic field on to the magnetic poles producing two or more localized x ray hot spots similar to the two auroral zones on earth but far hotter at these hotspots the infalling gas can reach half the speed of light before it impacts the neutron star surface so much gravitational potential energy is released by the infalling gas that the hotspots which are estimated to about one square kilometer in area can be ten thousand times or more as luminous than the sun temperatures of millions of degrees are produced so the hotspots emit mostly x rays as the neutron star rotates pulses

free oxygen is produced in the biosphere through photolysis light driven oxidation and splitting of water during photosynthesis in cyanobacteria green algae and plants during oxidative phosphorylation in cellular respiration oxygen is reduced to water thus closing the biological water oxygen redox cycle in nature free oxygen is produced by the light driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70 of the free oxygen produced on earth the remainder is produced by terrestrial plants although for example almost all oxygen produced in tropical forests is consumed by organisms living there a simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is photolytic oxygen evolution during photosynthesis occurs via the light dependent oxidation of water to molecular oxygen and can be written as the following simplified chemical reaction 2ho 4e 4h o the reaction occurs in the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria and algal and plant chloroplasts and requires the energy of four photons the electrons from the oxidized water molecules replace electrons in the p component of photosystem ii which have been removed into an electron transport chain via light dependent excitation and resonance energy transfer onto plastoquinone photosytem ii therefore has also been referred to

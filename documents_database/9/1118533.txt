in geometric topology it was introduced by and is often called the mazur swindle in algebra it was introduced by samuel eilenberg and is known as the eilenberg swindle or eilenberg telescope see telescoping sum the eilenberg mazur swindle is similar to the following well known joke proof that 1 0 this proof is not valid as a claim about real numbers because grandi s series 1 1 1 1 does not converge but the analogous argument can be used in some contexts where there is some sort of addition defined on some objects for which infinite sums do make sense to show that if a b 0 then a b 0 in geometric topology the addition used in the swindle is usually the connected sum of knots or manifolds example a typical application of the mazur swindle in geometric topology is the proof that the sum of two non trivial knots a and b is non trivial for knots it is possible to take infinite sums by making the knots smaller and smaller so if a b is trivial then so a is trivial and b by a similar argument the infinite sum of knots is usually a wild

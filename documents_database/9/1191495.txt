although it is np hard to compute the clique width when it is unbounded and unknown whether it can be computed in polynomial time when it is bounded efficient approximation algorithms for the clique width are known based on these algorithms and on courcelle s theorem many graph optimization problems that are np hard for arbitrary graphs can be solved or approximated quickly on the graphs of bounded clique width the construction sequences underlying the concept of clique width were formulated by courcelle engelfriet and rozenberg in 1990 and by the name clique width was used for a different concept by by 1993 the term already had its present meaning cographs are exactly the graphs with clique width at most 2 every distance hereditary graph has clique width at most 3 however the clique width of unit interval graphs is unbounded based on their grid structure similarly the clique width of bipartite permutation graphs is unbounded based on similar grid structure based on the characterization of cographs as the graphs without induced subgraph isomorphic to a chordless path with four vertices the clique width of many graph classes defined by forbidden induced subgraphs has been classified other graphs with bounded

in other words the players know the other s variables but not their own the minimum number of bits that must be communicated by the players to compute f is the communication complexity of f denoted by f the multiparty communication game defined in 1983 is a powerful generalization of the 2 party case here the players know all the others input except their own because of this property sometimes this model is called numbers on the forehead model since if the players were seated around a round table each wearing their own input on the forehead then every player would see all the others input except their own the formal definition is as follows k players p p p intend to compute a boolean function on set s x x x of variables there is a fixed partition a of k classes a a a and player p knows every variable except those in a for i 1 2 k the players have unlimited computational power and they communicate with the help of a blackboard viewed by all players the aim is to compute f x x x such that at the end of the computation every player knows

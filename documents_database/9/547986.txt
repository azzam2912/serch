there are two key aspects to effective neutron detection hardware and software detection hardware refers to the kind of neutron detector used the most common today is the scintillation detector and to the electronics used in the detection setup further the hardware setup also defines key experimental parameters such as source detector distance solid angle and detector shielding detection software consists of analysis tools that perform tasks such as graphical analysis to measure the number and energies of neutrons striking the detector atomic and subatomic particles are detected by the signature they produce through interaction with their surroundings the interactions result from the particles fundamental characteristics as a result of these properties detection of neutrons fall into several major categories gas proportional detectors can be adapted to detect neutrons while neutrons do not typically cause ionization the addition of a nuclide with high neutron cross section allows the detector to respond to neutrons nuclides commonly used for this purpose are helium 3 lithium 6 boron 10 and uranium 235 since these materials are most likely to react with thermal neutrons i e neutrons that have slowed to equilibrium with their surroundings they are typically surrounded by moderating materials to reduce

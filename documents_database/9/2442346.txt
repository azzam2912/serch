croix sensory that uses the science of olfactometry to measure the strength of smells the generic name for this type of device is field olfactometer the nasal ranger works via dilution the device has a filtration system that can produce nearly pure air the user has to breathe this filtered air for at least minute in order to cleanse their palate the user then turns a dial that allows in a tiny amount of ambient air mixed in with filtered air the user then inhales twice and turns the dial to the next step which is to cleanse the palate again each subsequent step increases the amount of ambient air taken in and is also followed by a cleansing of the palate and so on the step on the dial where the user first smells the problem odor determines the dilution to threshold ratio d t strong smells have a high d t the highest d t the nasal ranger can measure is 60 1 a d t this high would be associated with a very strong door strong doors only require the introduction of a tiny amount of ambient air to be detected a d t of 1 1

it is a university spin off of the sharp project which ended 2005 the quicklaunch proposed firing apparatus was a light gas gun using hydrogen as the working gas and natural gas as the explosive heat source heating and pre pressurizing the hydrogen working gas takes 10 minutes before the shot and most of the hydrogen is recovered by a muzzle muffler at the end of the launch tube to be reused for subsequent launches the long gun would be for the most part submerged in the ocean its horizontal and vertical direction azimuth and elevation could be adjusted based on customer launch requirements the proposed launcher was designed to give projectiles an initial speed of while the earth orbital speed is 6 9 to 7 8 km s the projectile design therefore included a one stage rocket which ignites some time after launch the designed payloads could include spacecraft satellites consumable water or fuel to supply a propellant depot in orbit projected dollar cost per pound to orbit were 500 1 100 kg in a 2016 article hunter remarked that the work had been put in stasis due in part to elon musk s company spacex taking up the

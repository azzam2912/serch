reportedly hiv patients coinfected with gbv c can survive longer than those without gbv c but the patients may be different in other ways research is active into the virus effects on the immune system in patients coinfected with gbv c and hiv the majority of immunocompetent individuals clear gbv c viraemia but in some individuals infection persists for decades however the time interval between gbv c infection and clearance of viraemia detection of gbv c rna in plasma is not known about 2 of healthy us blood donors are viraemic with gbv c and up to 13 of blood donors have antibodies to e2 protein indicating possible prior infection parenteral sexual and vertical transmissions of gbv c have been documented because of shared modes of transmission individuals infected with hiv are often coinfected with gbv c the prevalence of gbv c viraemia in hiv patients ranges from 14 to 43 several but not all studies have suggested that coinfection with gbv c slows the progression of hiv disease in vitro models also demonstrated that gbv c slows hiv replication this beneficial effect may be related to action of several gbv c viral proteins including ns5a phosphoprotein and e2 envelope

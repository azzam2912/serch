each successive language incorporates with a little cleaning up all the features of its predecessors plus a few more each new language claims new and fashionable features but the plain fact is that few languages make programming sufficiently cheaper or more reliable to justify the cost of producing and learning to use them he designed fp to be the first programming language to specifically support the function level programming style a function level program is variable free cf point free programming since program variables which are essential in value level definitions are not needed in function level programs in the function level style of programming a program is built directly from programs that are given at the outset by combining them with program forming operations or functionals thus in contrast with the value level approach that applies the given programs to values to form a succession of values culminating in the desired result value the function level approach applies program forming operations to the given programs to form a succession of programs culminating in the desired result program as a result the function level approach to programming invites study of the space of programs under program forming operations looking to

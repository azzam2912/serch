poteb is most probably aids in intracellular signaling but is not likely to be a secreted or nuclear protein poteb s function is likely to be regulated via 17 potential phosphorylation sites there is currently no evidence to suggest that poteb has nuclear localization signals poteb is located at 15q11 2 on chromosome 15 in humans and is transcribed from the reverse dna strand poteb is also known as poteb3 and pote15 the poteb gene is 47 547 base pairs in length and is composed of 11 s the poteb gene can be transcribed to create four potential mrnas however only one of these mrnas possessing all 11 s is capable of being translated to the poteb protein the three other transcripts do not encode proteins the poteb protein is composed of 544 amino acids and according to bioinformatic analyses has a molecular weight of 61 7 kda it has an isoelectric point of 5 68 its most common amino acids are leucine and glutamic acid which account for 11 and 10 3 of the protein respectively however this is normal for human proteins poteb is most likely a cytoplasmic protein that is phosphorylated at 17 serines threonines and tyrosines

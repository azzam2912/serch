bolton to determine the discrepancy between size of maxillary and mandibular teeth this analysis helps to determine the optimum interarch relationship this analysis measures the mesio distal width of each tooth and is divided into two analyses wayne a bolton presented this analysis in the year 1958 in 1962 he published another paper which talked about clinical applications of using bolton analysis in orthodontics he was the graduate of university of washington s first dental class in 1950 and also the first orthodontic class of 1952 a boley gauge is usually the instrument of choice to measure the widths of each teeth however in 1995 shellhart et al showed during their study that vernier caliper can also be used as an alternative for bolton analysis many other investigation models have been developed such as measurement from photocopies and traveling microscope but the studies have produced no results recently digital calipers from companies such as orthocad are being used to measure the mesiodistal widths of the teeth an overall analysis measures the sum of mesio distal width of all 12 first molar to first molar mandibular teeth and compares them to the 12 maxillary teeth the overall ratio known to be

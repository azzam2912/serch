knowledge of the preferred orientation in turn may be used to predict the strength of association or binding affinity between two molecules using for example scoring functions the associations between biologically relevant molecules such as proteins peptides nucleic acids carbohydrates and lipids play a central role in signal transduction furthermore the relative orientation of the two interacting partners may affect the type of signal produced e g agonism vs antagonism therefore docking is useful for predicting both the strength and type of signal produced molecular docking is one of the most frequently used methods in structure based drug design due to its ability to predict the binding conformation of small molecule ligands to the appropriate target binding site characterisation of the binding behaviour plays an important role in rational design of drugs as well as to elucidate fundamental biochemical processes one can think of molecular docking as a problem of lock and key in which one wants to find the correct relative orientation of the key which will open up the lock where on the surface of the lock is the key hole which direction to turn the key after it is inserted etc here the protein can be thought

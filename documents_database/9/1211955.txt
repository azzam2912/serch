at the onset of separation between the greenland and eurasian plates 55 million years ago it formed part of the eastern margin of the greenland plate propagation of a new spreading center from the reykjanes ridge separated this microcontinent from the greenland plate for a short period it formed a microplate until the aegir ridge became inactive after which it formed part of the eurasian plate the island of jan mayen is a much younger feature formed of volcanic rock built up at the northernmost tip of the microcontinent the microcontinent extends about 500 km southwards from the jan mayen fracture zone it is up to 160 km wide the jan mayen ridge separates the norwegian sea the norway basin from the greenland sea the microcontinent was identified originally on the basis of being a bathymetric high a positive free air gravity anomaly and due to the lack of magnetic anomalies all indicating that it consisted of continental crust this interpretation has been confirmed using wide angle seismic reflection and refraction data coupled with standard normal incidence seismic reflection data the microcontinent consists of the prominent bathymetric high the jan mayen ridge and several subsidiary ridges and intervening basins towards

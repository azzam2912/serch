like alpha motor neurons their cell bodies are located in the anterior grey column of the spinal cord they receive input from the reticular formation of the pons in the brainstem their axons are smaller than those of the alpha motor neurons with a diameter of only 5 m unlike the alpha motor neurons gamma motor neurons do not directly adjust the lengthening or shortening of muscles however their role is important in keeping muscle spindles taut thereby allowing the continued firing of alpha neurons leading to muscle contraction these neurons also play a role in adjusting the sensitivity of muscle spindles the presence of myelination in gamma motor neurons allows a conduction velocity of 4 to 24 meters per second significantly faster than with non myelinated axons but slower than in alpha motor neurons muscle spindles are the sensory receptors located within muscles that allow communication to the spinal cord and brain with information of where the body is in space proprioception and how fast body limbs are moving with relation to space velocity they are mechanoreceptors in that they respond to stretch and are able to signal changes in muscle length the sensitivity of detecting changes in muscle

friends from the university fascist group helped with its funding it was intended as a simple and low cost single seat trainer glider the eb 1 was a high wing braced monoplane with a wooden structure and skinned with a mixture of plywood and fabric its wings were built around two spars and were aerodynamically thick in plan they were unswept and of parallel chord ending in asymmetrical elliptical tips ailerons filled about half the span mounted with about 2 of dihedral they were braced to the fuselage on each side by a parallel pair of faired wooden struts which ran from the bottom of the fuselage to the wings at about one third span the eb 1 had a deep sided hexagonal cross section fuselage ply covered forward and fabric aft its cockpit immediately ahead of the wing was open but the pilot was partly sheltered by a long streamlined transparency which photographs show to have been modified at least once the tail surfaces were elliptical the fin tall and the rudder extending down to the keel its cantilever tailplane set at mid fuselage was fabric covered and carried balanced elevators well separated to allow the rudder to move

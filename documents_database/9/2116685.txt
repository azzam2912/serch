the signals are transmitted across the cell membrane to prompt a response the signal can cross the membrane itself or it can interact with receptor proteins that contact both the interior and exterior of a cell the correct receptor needs to be present on the cells surface to be able to respond to the signal signals pass from protein to protein when the signal travels through the cell membrane entering the cell the signal continues its journey to its destination be it the nucleus or any of the other structures or organelles in the cell when these signals are transmitted between proteins the proteins are modified creating a signaling pathway that can lead to a specific part of the cell or branch out sending the signal to multiple parts of the cell as the signal moves from each receptor in the proteins it can be amplified changing a small signal into a large response by dividing and amplifying the signal a signaling pathway is like the way relay runners work together the signal is transferred from the receptor on one protein to the receptor on the other protein the same way a relay runner hands off from one runner to

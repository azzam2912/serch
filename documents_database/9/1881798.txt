distribution of this group of alkaloids is essentially limited to plant family rutaceae the simplest member of this group is dictamnine and most widespread member is skimmianine a furoquinoline alkaloid dictamnine is very common within the family rutaceae it is the main alkaloid in the roots of dictamnus albus and responsible for the mutagenicity of the drug derived from crude extracts dictamnine was also reported to be a phototoxic and photomutagenic compound it participates in the severe skin phototoxicity of the plant another furoquinoline alkaloid skimmianine has strong antiacetylcholinesterase activity thomas first isolated dictamnine from rutaceae in 1923 it is very weak base shows similar reaction with methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfate or diazomethane does not form a derivative but go through isomerization to isodictamnine dictamine have linear structure which is confirmed as it forms dictamnic acid by oxidative degradation with potassium permanganate dieckmann cyclization followed by methylation and hydrolysis confirmed the structure of the acid skimmianine another common furoquinoline alkaloid also shows a very similar type of chemistry to dictamine skimmianine also has a linear structure as it gave 3 ethyl 4 7 8 trimethoxy 2 quinolone from hydrolysis some furoquinoline alkaloids have been found to have in vitro

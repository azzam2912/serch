it is used in the design of steering and suspension if the top of the wheel is farther out than the bottom that is away from the axle it is called positive camber if the bottom of the wheel is farther out than the top it is called negative camber camber angle alters the handling qualities of a particular suspension design in particular negative camber improves grip when cornering this is because it places the tire at a better angle to the road transmitting the forces through the vertical plane of the tire rather than through a shear force across it this effect is compensated for by applying negative camber maximizing the contact patch area note that this is only true for the outside tire during the turn the inside tire would benefit most from positive camber caster angle will compensate this to a degree as the top of the outside tire will tilt slightly inward and the inner tire will respectively tilt outward on the other hand for maximum straight line acceleration the greatest traction will be attained when the camber angle is zero and the tread is flat on the road proper management of camber angle is a

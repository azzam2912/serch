dasypodids and chlamyphorids the armadillos are the only surviving families in the order two groups of cingulates much larger than extant armadillos maximum body mass of 45 kg 100 lb in the case of the giant armadillo existed until recently pampatheriids which reached weights of up to 200 kg 440 lb and chlamyphorid glyptodonts which attained masses of 2 000 kg 4 400 lb or more the cingulate order originated in south america during the paleocene epoch about 66 to 56 million years ago and due to the continent s former isolation remained confined to it during most of the cenozoic however the formation of a land bridge allowed members of all three families to migrate to southern north america during the pliocene or early pleistocene as part of the great american interchange after surviving for tens of millions of years all of the pampatheriids and giant glyptodonts apparently died out during the quaternary extinction event at the beginning of the holocene along with much of the rest of the regional megafauna shortly after the colonization of the americas by paleo indians armadillos have dorsal armor that is formed by osteoderms plates of dermal bone covered in relatively small overlapping

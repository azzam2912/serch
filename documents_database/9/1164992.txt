thus specific force is not actually a force but a type of acceleration however the mass specific force is not a coordinate acceleration but rather a proper acceleration which is the acceleration relative to free fall forces specific forces and proper accelerations are the same in all reference frames but coordinate accelerations are frame dependent for free bodies the specific force is the cause of and a measure of the body s proper acceleration the g force acceleration is the same as the specific force the acceleration of an object free falling towards the earth depends on the reference frame it disappears in the free fall frame also called the inertial frame but any g force acceleration will be present in all frames this specific force is zero for freely falling objects since gravity acting alone does not produce g forces or specific forces accelerometers on the surface of the earth measure a constant 9 8 m s 2 even when they are not accelerating that is when they do not undergo coordinate acceleration this is because accelerometers measure the proper acceleration produced by the g force exerted by the ground gravity acting alone never produces g force or specific

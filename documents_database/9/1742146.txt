in fact ranking techniques can be used in key point localization or descriptor generation of the original sift algorithm ranking techniques can be used to keep certain number of key points which are detected by sift detector suppose formula 1 is a training image sequence and formula 2 is a key point obtained by sift detector the following equation determines the rank of formula 2 in the key point set larger value of formula 4 corresponds to the higher rank of formula 2 formula 6 where formula 7 is the indicator function formula 8 is the homography transformation from formula 9 to formula 10 and formula 11 is the threshold suppose formula 12 is the feature descriptor of key point formula 13 defined above so formula 12 can be labeled with the rank of formula 13 in the feature vector space then the vector set formula 16 containing labeled elements can be used as a training set for the ranking svm problem the learning process can be represented as follows formula 17 the obtained optimal formula 18 can be used to order the future key points ranking techniques also can be used to generate the key point descriptor suppose formula

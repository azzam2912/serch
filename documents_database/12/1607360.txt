with an estimated magnitude of 7 6 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of x extreme on the mercalli intensity scale the quake destroyed 1 167 houses and caused 275 deaths and 320 injuries the earthquake was located close to the northern margin of the tibetan plateau this area of thickened crust is a result of the ongoing collision of the indo australian plate with the eurasian plate the way in which this zone accommodates the collision remains unclear with two end member models being proposed the first regards the crust as being made up of a mosaic of strong blocks separated by weak fault zones the microplate model the second regards the deformation as being continuous within the mid to lower crust the continuum model the change in width of the deformed zone along the collisional belt with the narrow zone of western tibet compared to the main part of the tibetan plateau is explained as either lateral escape to the east along the altyn tagh and karakorum faults in the microplate model or as the effect of the rigid tarim basin block causing heterogeneous deformation within a generally weaker lithosphere in the continuum

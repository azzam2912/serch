m craik and robert s lockhart in 1972 describes memory recall of stimuli as a function of the depth of mental processing deeper levels of analysis produce more elaborate longer lasting and stronger memory traces than shallow levels of analysis depth of processing falls on a shallow to deep continuum shallow processing e g processing based on phonemic and orthographic components leads to a fragile memory trace that is susceptible to rapid decay conversely deep processing e g semantic processing results in a more durable memory trace this theory contradicts the multi store atkinson shiffrin memory model which represents memory strength as being continuously variable the assumption being that rehearsal always improves long term memory they argued that rehearsal that consists simply of repeating previous analyses maintenance rehearsal doesn t enhance long term memory in a study from 1975 craik and tulving participants were given a list of 60 words each word was presented along with three questions the participant had to answer one of them those three questions were in one of three categories one category of questions was about how the word was presented visually is the word shown in italics the second category of questions was about

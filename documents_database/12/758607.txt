although gram negative methylobacteria often stain gram variable and are easily isolated using methanol based mineral medium their pigmentation which is frequently pink but may also be yellow or orange is thought to provide protection from solar uv radiation which damages the dna of bacteria at low doses because of their small cell size this color is present due to the carotenoid pigments within the cell the metabolism of ppfms is unusual because as their name suggests they are able to utilize c1 compounds such as formaldehyde methanol and methylamine ppfm bacteria can undergo methylotrophy a process in which the bacteria oxidize methanol with the help of the enzymes methanol dehydrogenase mdh and pyrroloquinoline quinone pqq linked protein in dense and diverse communities like those found in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere this enables them to utilize nutrients other bacteria cannot enhancing their competitive ability in certain environments there are limited concentrations of elements such as carbon and phosphate in a usable form research suggests that ppfms breakdown unusable forms of carbon into usable forms for other species forming symbiotic relationships ppfm bacteria form symbiotic relationships with numerous species of plants ppfms are horizontally transmitted to the next generation of plants

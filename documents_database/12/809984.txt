it is a tool aiding the development of formal proofs by man machine collaboration providing a programming environment where formal specifications executable algorithms and automatically verifiable correctness certificates naturally coexist matita is based on a dependent type system known as the calculus of co inductive constructions a derivative of calculus of constructions and is compatible to some extent with coq the word matita means pencil in italian a simple and widespread editing tool it is a reasonably small and simple application whose architectural and software complexity is meant to be mastered by students providing a tool particularly suited for testing innovative ideas and solutions matita adopts a tactic based editing mode xml encoded proof objects are produced for storage and exchange existential variables are native in matita allowing a simpler management of dependent goals matita implements a bidirectional type inference algorithm exploiting both inferred and expected types the power of the type inference system refiner is further augmented by a mechanism of hints that helps in synthetizing unifiers in particular situations specified by the user matita supports a sophisticated disambiguation strategy based on a dialog between the parser and the typechecker at the interactive level the system implements a small

test cases underlie testing that is methodical rather than haphazard a battery of test cases can be built to produce the desired coverage of the software being tested formally defined test cases allow the same tests to be run repeatedly against successive versions of the software allowing for effective and consistent regression testing in order to fully test that all the requirements of an application are met there must be at least two test cases for each requirement one positive test and one negative test if a requirement has sub requirements each sub requirement must have at least two test cases keeping track of the link between the requirement and the test is frequently done using a traceability matrix written test cases should include a description of the functionality to be tested and the preparation required to ensure that the test can be conducted a formal written test case is characterized by a known input and by an expected output which is worked out before the test is executed the known input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a postcondition for applications or systems without formal requirements test cases can be written based on the accepted

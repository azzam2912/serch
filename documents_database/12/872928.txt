the relative position and angle of the axes is typically uninformative but various heuristics such as algorithms that plot data as the maximal total area can be applied to sort the variables axes into relative positions that reveal distinct correlations trade offs and a multitude of other comparative measures the radar chart is also known as web chart spider chart star chart star plot cobweb chart irregular polygon polar chart or kiviat diagram it is equivalent to a parallel coordinates plot with the axes arranged radially the radar chart is a chart and or plot that consists of a sequence of equi angular spokes called radii with each spoke representing one of the variables the data length of a spoke is proportional to the magnitude of the variable for the data point relative to the maximum magnitude of the variable across all data points a line is drawn connecting the data values for each spoke this gives the plot a star like appearance and the origin of one of the popular names for this plot the star plot can be used to answer the following questions radar charts are a useful way to display multivariate observations with an arbitrary number

the network has an assortative nature hubs tend to link to other hubs and low degree nodes tend to link to low degree nodes assortativity is not structural meaning that it is not a consequence of the degree distribution but it is generated by some process that governs the network s evolution a detailed reconstruction of an actual collaboration was made by mark newman he analyzed the collaboration networks through several large databases in the fields of biology and medicine physics and computer science in a five year window 1995 1999 the results showed that these networks form small worlds in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances they also suggest that the networks are highly clustered i e two scientists are much more likely to have collaborated if they have a third common collaborator than are two scientists chosen randomly from the community barabasi et al studied the collaboration networks in mathematics and neuro science of an 8 year period 1991 1998 to understand the topological and dynamical laws governing complex networks they viewed the collaboration network as a prototype of evolving networks as it expands by the addition

it binds to ic3b inactive derivative of c3b c3dg or c3d b cells express cr2 receptors on their surfaces allowing the complement system to play a role in b cell activation and maturation complement receptor 2 interacts with cd19 and on mature b cells forms a complex with cd81 tapa 1 the cr2 cd19 cd81 complex is often called the b cell co receptor complex because cr2 binds to opsonized antigens through attached c3d or ic3b or c3dg when the b cell receptor binds antigen this results in the b cell having greatly enhanced response to the antigen epstein barr virus ebv can bind cr2 enabling ebv to enter and infect b cells yefenof et al 1976 found complete overlapping of ebv receptors and c3 receptors on human b cells the canonical cr2 cd21 gene of subprimate mammals produces two types of complement receptor cr1 ca 200 kda cr2 ca 145 kda via alternative mrna splicing the murine cr2 gene contains 25 exons a common first exon is spliced to exon 2 and to exon 9 in transcripts encoding cr1 and cr2 respectively a transcript with an open reading frame of 4 224 nucleotides encodes the long isoform cr1 this

it was first invented in 1914 by german scientists wilhelm schloemilch and otto von bronk and rediscovered and extended to multiple tubes in 1917 by marius latour and william h priess the radio signal from the antenna and tuned circuit passes through an amplifier is demodulated in a detector which extracts the audio signal from the radio carrier and the resulting audio signal passes again through the same amplifier for audio amplification before being applied to the earphone or loudspeaker the reason for using the amplifier for double duty was to reduce the number of active devices vacuum tubes or transistors required in the circuit to reduce the cost the economical reflex circuit was used in inexpensive vacuum tube radios in the 1920s and was revived again in simple portable tube radios in the 1930s the block diagram shows the general form of a simple reflex receiver the receiver functions as a tuned radio frequency trf receiver the radio frequency rf signal from the tuned circuit bandpass filter is amplified then passes through the high pass filter to the demodulator which extracts the audio frequency af modulation signal from the carrier wave the audio signal is added back into the

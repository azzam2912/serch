it is one of the four isomers of butanol tert butyl alcohol is a colorless solid which melts near room temperature and has a camphor like odor it is miscible with water ethanol and diethyl ether tert butyl alcohol has been identified in beer and chickpeas it is also found in cassava which is used as a fermentation ingredient in certain alcoholic beverages tert butyl alcohol is derived commercially from isobutane as a coproduct of propylene oxide production it can also be produced by the catalytic hydration of isobutylene or by a grignard reaction between acetone and methylmagnesium chloride purification cannot be performed by simple distillation due to formation of an azeotrope with water although initial drying of the solvent containing large amounts of water is performed by adding benzene to form a tertiary azeotrope and distilling off the water smaller amounts of water are removed by drying with calcium oxide cao potassium carbonate kco calcium sulfate caso or magnesium sulfate mgso followed by fractional distillation anhydrous tert butyl alcohol is obtained by further refluxing and distilling from magnesium activated with iodine or alkali metals such as sodium or potassium other methods include the use of 4 molecular sieves aluminium

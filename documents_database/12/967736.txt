torsion is the rotation of the visceral mass mantle and shell 180 with respect to the head and foot of the gastropod this rotation brings the mantle cavity and the anus to an anterior position above the head in some groups of gastropods opisthobranchia there is a degree of secondary detorsion or rotation towards the original position this may be only partial detorsion or full detorsion the torsion or twisting of the visceral mass of larval gastropods is not the same thing as the spiral coiling of the shell which is also present in many shelled gastropods there are two different developmental stages which cause torsion the first stage is caused by the development of the asymmetrical velar foot muscle which has one end attached to the left side of the shell and the other end has fibres attached to the left side of the foot and head at a certain point in larval development this muscle contracts causing an anticlockwise rotation of the visceral mass and mantle of roughly 90 this process is very rapid taking from a few minutes to a few hours after this transformation the second stage of torsion development is achieved by differential tissue growth

in general they can be defined as the simplest mechanisms that use mechanical advantage also called leverage to multiply force usually the term refers to the six classical simple machines that were defined by renaissance scientists a simple machine uses a single applied force to do work against a single load force ignoring friction losses the work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force the machine can increase the amount of the output force at the cost of a proportional decrease in the distance moved by the load the ratio of the output to the applied force is called the mechanical advantage simple machines can be regarded as the elementary building blocks of which all more complicated machines sometimes called compound machines are composed for example wheels levers and pulleys are all used in the mechanism of a bicycle the mechanical advantage of a compound machine is just the product of the mechanical advantages of the simple machines of which it is composed although they continue to be of great importance in mechanics and applied science modern mechanics has moved beyond the view of the simple machines as the ultimate building blocks of

antecedent moisture conditions change continuously and can have a very significant effect on the flow responses in these systems during wet weather the effect is evident in most hydrologic systems including stormwater runoff and sanitary sewers with inflow and infiltration many modeling and analysis challenges that are created by antecedent moisture conditions are evident within combined sewers and separate sanitary sewer systems the word antecedent simply means preceding conditions combining the terms antecedent and moisture together means preceding wetness conditions antecedent moisture is the relative wetness or dryness of a sewershed which changes continuously and can have a very significant effect on the flow responses in these systems during wet weather antecedent moisture conditions are high when there has been a lot of recent rainfall and the ground is moist antecedent moisture conditions are low when there has been little rainfall and the ground becomes dry rainfall runoff relationship are well defined within the field of hydrology surface runoff in hydrologic systems is generally conceptualized as occurring from pervious and impervious areas it is the pervious runoff that is affected by antecedent moisture conditions as runoff from impervious surfaces such as roads sidewalks and roofs will not be significantly affected

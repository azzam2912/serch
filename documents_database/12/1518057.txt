the focal resemblance to other salivary gland type tumors may cause diagnostic difficulties particularly in small endobronchial biopsies although little is known about their biologic potential due to limited follow up data these tumors when in the lung clearly have the capacity to infiltrate and metastasize and therefore should be designated as epithelial myoepithelial carcinoma at present it appears that treatment by complete surgical resection with negative margins alone is appropriate and adequate lung cancer is an extremely heterogeneous family of malignant neoplasms with well over 50 different histological variants recognized under the 4th revision of the world health organization who typing system who 2004 currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme because these variants have differing genetic biological and clinical properties including response to treatment correct classification of lung cancer cases are necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management the who 2004 scheme groups lung carcinomas into 8 major types emecl is considered a subtype of salivary gland like carcinoma tumors so named because their histological appearance and characteristics closely resemble malignant neoplasms arising in the major and minor salivary glands emecl is staged in the same manner as other non small cell lung

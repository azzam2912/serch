much like categorial grammar cg pg is a kind of type logical grammar unlike cg however pg does not have a distinguished function type rather pg uses inverse types combined with its monoidal operation a pregroup is a partially ordered algebra formula 1 such that formula 2 is a monoid satisfying the following relations the contraction and expansion relations are sometimes called ajdukiewicz laws from this it can be proven that the following equations hold formula 8 and formula 9 are called the left and right adjoints of x respectively the symbol formula 10 and formula 11 are also written formula 12 and formula 13 respectively in category theory pregroups are also known as autonomous categories or non symmetric compact closed categories more typically formula 14 will just be represented by adjacency i e as formula 15 a pregroup grammar consists of a lexicon of words and possibly morphemes l a set of atomic types t which freely generates a pregroup and an relation formula 16 that relates words to types in simple pregroup grammars typing is a function that maps words to only one type each some simple intuitive examples using english as the language to model demonstrate the

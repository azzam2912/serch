the pla2g6 gene produces an 18 6 kda protein composed of 166 amino acids the resulting protein s structure has been shown to contain a lipase motif and 8 ankyrin repeats different from rodent pla2g6 which is known to share 90 overall amino acid sequence identity with that of the humans the human pla2g6 protein contains a 54 residue insertion which codes for a proline rich region this insertion has been shown to disrupt the last putative ankyrin repeat as well as function as a linker region that segregates the n terminal protein binding domain from the c terminal catalytic domain the pla2g6 gene encodes for a phospholipase a2 enzyme which is a subclass of enzyme that catalyzes the release of fatty acids from phospholipids this type of enzyme is responsible for breaking down metabolizing phospholipids phospholipid metabolism is essential for many body processes including helping to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane specifically the a2 phospholipase produced from the pla2g6 gene sometimes called pla2 group vi helps to regulate the levels of a compound called phosphatidylcholine which is abundant in the cell membrane the encoded protein may also play a role in phospholipid remodelling arachidonic acid release nitric

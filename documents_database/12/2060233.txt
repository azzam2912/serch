normally the trigeminal artery involutes after the formation of the posterior communicating artery however in some cases the artery persists into adulthood and can cause medical complications including intracranial aneurysms the trigeminal artery arises from the primitive internal carotid artery during development when the embryo is approximately 6 weeks old the trigeminal artery then anastomoses with the basilar artery at this point in development the trigeminal artery serves as the main blood supply for the hindbrain as other vessels in the region have yet to mature as the internal carotid artery branches more caudally to form the posterior communicating artery the trigeminal artery becomes less important in supplying blood and ultimately involutes the time period from the initial development of the artery to its ultimate involution is only 7 to 10 days if the artery has not involuted at the end of this period it persists into adulthood in around 0 1 to 0 6 of individuals as sampled by magnetic resonance angiography the trigeminal artery fails to involute and remains in the adult brain in a condition called persistent trigeminal artery this condition is more common in women than in men with approximately 1 8 times as many women

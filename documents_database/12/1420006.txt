impacts can result in erosion sinkholes loss of biodiversity or the contamination of soil groundwater and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes these processes also have an impact on the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which have effect on the quality of human health and biodiversity some mining methods may have such significant environmental and public health effects that mining companies in some countries are required to follow strict environmental and rehabilitation codes to ensure that the mined area returns to its original state erosion of exposed hillsides mine dumps tailings dams and resultant siltation of drainages creeks and rivers can significantly impact the surrounding areas a prime example being the giant ok tedi mine in papua new guinea in wilderness areas mining may cause destruction and disturbance of ecosystems and habitats and in areas of farming it may disturb or destroy productive grazing and croplands in urbanized environments mining may produce noise pollution dust pollution and visual pollution a sinkhole at or near a mine site is typically caused from the failure of a mine roof from the extraction of resources weak overburden or geological discontinuities the overburden at the mine site can develop cavities

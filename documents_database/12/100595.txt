usually phosphodiesterase refers to cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases which have great clinical significance and are described below however there are many other families of phosphodiesterases including phospholipases c and d autotaxin sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase dnases rnases and restriction endonucleases which all break the phosphodiester backbone of dna or rna as well as numerous less well characterized small molecule phosphodiesterases the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases comprise a group of enzymes that degrade the phosphodiester bond in the second messenger molecules camp and cgmp they regulate the localization duration and amplitude of cyclic nucleotide signaling within subcellular domains pdes are therefore important regulators of signal transduction mediated by these second messenger molecules these multiple forms isoforms or subtypes of phosphodiesterase were isolated from rat brain using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the early 1970s and were soon afterward shown to be selectively inhibited by a variety of drugs in brain and other tissues the potential for selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors to be used as therapeutic agents was predicted in the 1970s this prediction has now come to pass in a variety of fields e g sildenafil as a pde5 inhibitor and rolipram as a pde4 inhibitor the pde nomenclature signifies the pde family with an arabic numeral

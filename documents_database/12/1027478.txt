a discriminative classifier tries to model by just depending on the observed data while learning how to do the classification from the given statistics the approaches used in supervised learning can be categorized into discriminative models or generative models compared to generative models discriminative models make fewer assumptions about distributions and rely more on data quality for example given a set of labeled pictures of dog and rabbit discriminative models will be matching a new unlabeled picture to a most similar labeled picture and then give out the label class a dog or a rabbit however generative will develop a model which should be able to output a class label to the unlabeled picture from the assumption they made like all rabbits have red eyes the typical discriminative learning approaches include logistic regression lr support vector machine svm conditional random fields crfs specified over an undirected graph and others the typical generative model approaches contain naive bayes gaussian mixture model and others unlike the generative modelling which studies from the joint probability formula 1 the discriminative modeling studies the formula 2 or the direct maps the given unobserved variable target formula 3 a class label formula 4 depended on the

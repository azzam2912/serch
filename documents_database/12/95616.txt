however a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables the input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes in place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements an algorithm which is not in place is sometimes called not in place or out of place in place can have slightly different meanings in its strictest form the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space counting everything including function calls and pointers however this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires o log n bits more broadly in place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation usually this space is o log n though sometimes anything in o n is allowed note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used often the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed ignoring their length in this article we refer to total space complexity

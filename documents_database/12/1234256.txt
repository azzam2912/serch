if a sensitive indicating instrument is used very little current is drawn from the source of the unknown voltage since the reference voltage can be produced from an accurately calibrated voltage divider a potentiometer can provide high precision in measurement the method was described by johann christian poggendorff around 1841 and became a standard laboratory measuring technique in this arrangement a fraction of a known voltage from a resistive slide wire is compared with an unknown voltage by means of a galvanometer the sliding contact or wiper of the potentiometer is adjusted and the galvanometer briefly connected between the sliding contact and the unknown voltage the deflection of the galvanometer is observed and the sliding tap adjusted until the galvanometer no longer deflects from zero at that point the galvanometer draws no current from the unknown source and the magnitude of voltage can be calculated from the position of the sliding contact this null balance measuring method is still important in electrical metrology and standards work and is also used in other areas of electronics measurement potentiometers are divided into four main classes listed below the principle of a potentiometer is that the potential dropped across a segment of a

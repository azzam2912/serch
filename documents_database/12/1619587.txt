the design of the canopy and the instrument panel is practically the same as on other dg gliders the control surfaces incorporate flaperons which serve as both flaps and ailerons the wing has a newly designed thinner airfoil and higher aspect ratio than previous types of dg gliders this gives a higher performance but at a cost of worse slow speed characteristics making it less suitable for gliding competitions with frequent gaggles in thermals the same problem is also noticeable on ls 7 and asw 24 gliders where improved performance was to be achieved with thinner airfoils the negative effects i e a stall without much warning of this design are most pronounced on 15 meter wingspan without winglets these characteristics caused the relative unpopularity of this glider and only 114 aircraft were produced partially because the moulds were later destroyed in a factory fire later versions with 17 and 18 m wingspan offer much better low speed handling note the following data represent later versions of dg 600

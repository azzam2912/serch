a fluid containing the contents of lysed cells is called a lysate in molecular biology biochemistry and cell biology laboratories cell cultures may be subjected to lysis in the process of purifying their components as in protein purification dna extraction rna extraction or in purifying organelles many species of bacteria are subject to lysis by the enzyme lysozyme found in animal saliva egg white and other secretions phage lytic enzymes lysins produced during bacteriophage infection are responsible for the ability of these viruses to lyse bacterial cells penicillin and related lactam antibiotics cause the death of bacteria through enzyme mediated lysis that occurs after the drug causes the bacterium to form a defective cell wall if the cell wall is completely lost and the penicillin was used on gram positive bacteria then the bacterium is referred to as a protoplast but if penicillin was used on gram negative bacteria then it is called a spheroplast cytolysis occurs when a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance that has caused excess water to move into the cell cytolysis can be prevented by several different mechanisms including the contractile vacuole that exists in some paramecia which rapidly pump water out of the

this often occurs where a bearer must be tied down to a post or column but the bearer cannot be directly fastened to the post of column it has a shaft which is cranked or bent twice once off center and a second time to bring the shaft back parallel to the original shaft the requirement for an offset tie down will occur when vermin proofing must be placed between the column or post and a wooden bearer for example to stop termites travelling up through a concrete or wooden post or column directly into the bearer and the rest of the building the ant capping typically a 0 5mm to 0 8mm thick galvanised steel sheet must be placed between the post and the bearer overlapping the perimeter of the post by approximately 20mm to 40mm or more the cranked eye bolt is fastened to the post using a bolt though the eye the crank in the shaft allowing the shaft to be positioned so that it does not impede the overlap of the ant capping up through the bearer should termite attack occur the post of column can be replaced with no structural effect to the building cranked

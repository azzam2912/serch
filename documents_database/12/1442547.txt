any permutation may be written in one line notation as a sequence of digits representing the result of applying the permutation to the digit sequence 123 for instance the digit sequence 213 represents the permutation on three elements that swaps elements 1 and 2 if and are two permutations represented in this way these variable names are standard for permutations and are unrelated to the number pi then is said to contain as a pattern if some subsequence of the digits of has the same relative order as all of the digits of for instance permutation contains the pattern 213 whenever has three digits x y and z that appear within in the order x y z but whose values are ordered as y catalan numbers another early landmark result in the field is the erd s szekeres theorem in permutation pattern language the theorem states that for any positive integers a and b every permutation of length at least formula 1 must contain either the pattern formula 2 or the pattern formula 3 the study of permutation patterns began in earnest with donald knuth s consideration of stack sorting in 1968 knuth showed that the permutation can be sorted

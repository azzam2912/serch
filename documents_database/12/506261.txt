satellite galaxies and their constituents are bound to their host galaxy in the same way that planets within our own solar system are gravitationally bound to the sun while most satellite galaxies are dwarf galaxies satellite galaxies of large galaxy clusters can be much more massive the milky way is orbited by about fifty satellite galaxies the largest of which is the large magellanic cloud moreover satellite galaxies are not the only astronomical objects that are gravitationally bound to larger host galaxies see globular clusters for this reason astronomers have defined galaxies as gravitationally bound collections of stars that exhibit properties that cannot be explained by a combination of baryonic matter i e ordinary matter and newton s laws of gravity for example measurements of the orbital speed of stars and gas within spiral galaxies result in a velocity curve that deviates significantly from the theoretical prediction this observation has motivated various explanations such as the theory of dark matter and modifications to newtonian dynamics therefore despite also being satellites of host galaxies globular clusters should not be mistaken for satellite galaxies satellite galaxies are not only more extended and diffuse compared to globular clusters but are also enshrouded in

the original paper study was complete in 1972 and building of the prototype began in 1974 the first machine was delivered to queen mary college in 1979 the initial pilot dap was designed and implemented by dr stewart f reddaway with the aid of david j hunt and peter m flanders at the icl stevenage labs their manager and a major contributor was john k iliffe who had designed the basic language machine he is well known nowadays for iliffe vectors the icl dap had 64x64 single bit processing elements pes with 4096 bits of storage per pe it was attached to an icl mainframe and its memory was mapped into the mainframe s memory programs for the dap were written in dap fortran which was fortran extended with 64x64 matrix and 64 element vector primitives dap fortran compiled to an assembly language called apal array processor assembly language the dap had a single instruction multiple data simd architecture each operation could be performed under the control of a mask which controlled which elements were affected array programs were executed as subroutines of normal mainframe fortran programs and io was handled by the mainframe operationally there was an overhead to

due to the limited benefits and time individuals have for learning new information individuals use various shortcuts and heuristics to understand information quicker simply put it does not make sense for the average individual to develop in depth understandings of most issues the theory is often used to explain the limited understanding of politics and scientific technologies by the general public the concept of low information rationality is based on the assumption that human beings are cognitive misers and minimize the economic costs of making decisions and forming attitudes most citizens will therefore not bother to develop an in depth understanding of political or scientific issues which would require significant time and effort rather they collect only as much information as they think is necessary to make any given decision the reason this theory comes about in today s age is due to vast increase in amount of information that each of us is exposed to through the internet smart phones and tv therefore these patterns of information processing make perfect sense for citizens who have to deal with thousands of pieces of new information every day and we all use them we spend less cognitive effort in buying toothpaste

as a graduate student herman already exhibited eclectic tendencies in diverse fields by also working in solid state physics as well as straddling theory and experiment he spent the academic year 1940 41 working on the bush differential analyzer at the moore school of electrical engineering university of pennsylvania and another year teaching physics at the city college of new york in 1942 he left teaching to work at the department of terrestrial magnetism the carnegie institution of washington d c and the applied physics laboratory of johns hopkins university all research centers for the war effort he worked on such problems as the proximity fuse for naval antiaircraft gunfire which was used effectively during the war it was then that herman became intrigued with defining and solving complex problems he shifted his attention from theory and laboratory work and became deeply involved with field testing of the proximity device and the operational problems associated with its use in the fleet in 1945 he received the naval ordnance development award after world war ii herman spent another decade at the applied physics lab pursuing research in spectroscopy and condensed matter physics it was during this period that he and ralph

in some cases the order of integration can be validly interchanged in others it cannot the problem for examination is evaluation of an integral of the form where d is some two dimensional area in the xy plane for some functions f straightforward integration is feasible but where that is not true the integral can sometimes be reduced to simpler form by changing the order of integration the difficulty with this interchange is determining the change in description of the domain d the method also is applicable to other multiple integrals sometimes even though a full evaluation is difficult or perhaps requires a numerical integration a double integral can be reduced to a single integration as illustrated next reduction to a single integration makes a numerical evaluation much easier and more efficient consider the iterated integral which we will write using the prefix notation commonly seen in physics in this expression the second integral is calculated first with respect to y and x is held constant a strip of width dx is integrated first over the y direction a strip of width dx in the x direction is integrated with respect to the y variable across the y direction adding

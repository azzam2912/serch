at other locations a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies but at the lagrangian points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies the centripetal force of orbital motion and for certain points the coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies there are five such points labeled l to l all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies for each given combination of two orbital bodies for instance there are five lagrangian points l to l for the sun earth system and in a similar way there are five different lagrangian points for the earth moon system l l and l are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies l and l each form an equilateral triangle with the centers of the large bodies l and l are stable which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies several planets have trojan satellites near their l and l points with respect to the sun jupiter has more

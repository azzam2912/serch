furthermore tnt is a scaffold less tissue engineering te technique that can be considered cell only or tissue inducing depending on cellular or tissue level applications the transfection method makes use of nanochannels to deliver cargo to tissues topically cargo delivery methods rely on carriers for example nanoparticles viral vectors or physical approaches such as gene guns microinjection or electroporation the various methods can be limited by size constraints or their ability to efficiently deliver cargo without damaging tissue electroporation is a physical method which harnesses an electric field to open pores in the normally semi permeable cell membrane through which cargo can enter in this process the charges can be used to drive cargo in a specific direction bulk electroporation bep is the most conventional electroporation method benefits come in the form of high throughput and minimal set up times the downside of bep is that the cell membrane experiences an uneven distribution of the electric field and many membranes receive irreversible damage from which they can no longer close thus leading to low cell viability attempts have been made to miniaturize electroporation such as microelectroportaion mep and nanochannel electroporation nep which uses electroporation approached to deliver cargo through

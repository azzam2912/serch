the highest form the hexipentisteriruncicantitruncated 7 simplex is more simply called a omnitruncated 7 simplex with all of the nodes ringed in seven dimensional geometry a hexicated 7 simplex is a convex uniform 7 polytope a hexication 6th order truncation of the regular 7 simplex or alternately can be seen as an expansion operation its 56 vertices represent the root vectors of the simple lie group a the vertices of the hexicated 7 simplex can be most simply positioned in 8 space as permutations of 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 this construction is based on facets of the hexicated 8 orthoplex a second construction in 8 space from the center of a rectified 8 orthoplex is given by coordinate permutations of the vertices of the hexitruncated 7 simplex can be most simply positioned in 8 space as permutations of 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 this construction is based on facets of the hexitruncated 8 orthoplex the vertices of the hexicantellated 7 simplex can be most simply positioned in 8 space as permutations of 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 this construction is based on facets of the hexicantellated 8 orthoplex the vertices

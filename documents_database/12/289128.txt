actinism is derived from the greek a ray or beam the word actinism is found for example in the terminology of imaging technology esp photography medicine concerning sunburn and chemistry concerning containers that protect from photo degradation and the concept of actinism is applied for example in chemical photography and x ray imaging actinic chemicals include silver salts used in photography and other light sensitive chemicals in chemical terms actinism is the property of radiation that lets it be absorbed by a molecule and cause a photochemical reaction as a result einstein was the first to correctly theorize that each photon would be able to cause only one molecular reaction this distinction separates photochemical reactions from exothermic reduction reactions triggered by radiation for general purposes photochemistry is the commonly used vernacular rather than actinic or actino chemistry which are again more commonly seen used for photography or imaging in medicine actinic effects are generally described in terms of the dermis or outer layers of the body such as eyes see actinic conjunctivitis and upper tissues that the sun would normally affect rather than deeper tissues that higher energy shorter wavelength radiation such as x ray and gamma might affect actinic

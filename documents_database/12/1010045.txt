thienamycin has excellent activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria and is resistant to bacterial lactamase enzymes thienamycin is a zwitterion at ph 7 in 1976 fermentation broths obtained from the soil bacterium streptomyces cattleya were found to be active in a screen for inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthesis initial attempts to isolate the active compound proved difficult due to its chemical instability after many attempts and extensive purification the material was finally isolated in 90 purity allowing for the structural elucidation of thienamycin in 1979 figure 1 thienamycin was the first among the naturally occurring class of carbapenem antibiotics to be discovered and isolated carbapenems are similar in structure to their antibiotic cousins the penicillins like penicillins carbapenems contain a lactam ring cyclic amide fused to a five membered ring carbapenems differ in structure from penicillins in that within the five membered ring a sulfur is replaced by a carbon atom c1 and an unsaturation is present between c2 and c3 in the five membered ring in vitro thienamycin employs a similar mode of action as penicillins through disrupting the cell wall synthesis peptidoglycan biosynthesis of various gram positive and gram negative bacteria staphylococcus aureus staphylococcus epidermidis pseudomonas

the concept was described shortly after wwii in pp 175 189 of pulse generators vol 5 of the mit radiation lab series also d bradley j higgins m key and s majumdar realized a tlp based laser triggered spark gap for kilovolt pulses of accurately variable timing in 1969 for investigation of esd and electrical overstress eos effects a measurement system using a tlp generator has been introduced first by t maloney and n khurana in 1985 since then the technique has become indispensable for integrated circuit esd protection development the tlp technique is based on charging a long floating cable to a pre determined voltage and discharging it into a device under test dut the cable discharge emulates an electro static discharge event but employing time domain reflectometry tdr the change in dut impedance can be monitored as a function of time the first commercial tlp system was developed by barth electronics in 1990s since then other commercial systems have been developed e g by thermo fisher scientific grundtech esdemc technology high power pulse instruments hanwa tlpsol a subset of tlp vf tlp very fast transmission line pulsing has lately gained popularity with its improved resolution and bandwidth for

lymphocytes include natural killer cells which function in cell mediated cytotoxic innate immunity t cells for cell mediated cytotoxic adaptive immunity and b cells for humoral antibody driven adaptive immunity they are the main type of cell found in lymph which prompted the name lymphocyte the three major types of lymphocyte are t cells b cells and natural killer nk cells lymphocytes can be identified by their large nucleus t cells thymus cells and b cells bone marrow or bursa derived cells are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response t cells are involved in cell mediated immunity whereas b cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity relating to antibodies the function of t cells and b cells is to recognize specific non self antigens during a process known as antigen presentation once they have identified an invader the cells generate specific responses that are tailored maximally to eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen infected cells b cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses in response to pathogens some t cells called t helper cells produce cytokines that direct the immune response while other t cells called

gloemargarita s ancestor would have ended up in the ancestral archeaplastida through a singular endosymbiotic event some 1400 million years ago these plastids have appeared in other eukaryotes as the archaeplastida have become endosymbionts themselves repeatedly the importance of this event for life on earth is of course impossible to overstate even though the great oxygenation event appears to have occurred before gloemargarita appears related to a basal synechococcus branch a similar endosymbiotic event occurred about 500 million years ago with another synechococcus related bacteria appearing in paulinella chromatophora g lithophora was first isolated in 2007 from microbiolate samples taken from alkaline lake alchichica mexico these samples were maintained in a lab aquarium and g lithophora was isolated from biofilm that occurred within the aquarium g lithophora are gram negative unicellular rods with oxygenic photoautotrophic metabolism and gliding motility they contain chlorophyll a and phycocyanin and photosynthetic thylakoids located peripherall cells are 1 1 m wide and 3 9 m long on average growth occurred in both liquid and solid bg 11 growth media as well as in alkaline water optimal growth temperature is 25 c and optimal growth ph is 8 8 5

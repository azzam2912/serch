these may be a single taxon or combinations of taxa if the taxa are relatively abundant or variations in features related to the distribution of fossils the same strata may be zoned differently depending on the diagnostic criteria or fossil group chosen so there may be several sometimes overlapping biostratigraphic units in the same interval like lithostratigraphic units biozones must have a type section designated as a stratotype these stratotypes are named according to the typical taxon or taxa that are found in that particular biozone the boundary of two distinct biostratigraphic units is called a biohorizon biozones can be further subdivided into subbiozones and multiple biozones can be grouped together in a superbiozone in which the grouped biozones usually have a related characteristic a succession of biozones is called biozonation the length of time represented by a biostratigraphic zone is called a biochron the concept of a biozone was first established by the 19th century paleontologist albert oppel who characterized rock strata by the species of the fossilized animals found in them which he called zone fossils oppel s biozonation was mainly based on jurassic ammonites he found throughout europe which he used to classify the period into 33

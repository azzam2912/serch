the aircraft successfully traveled as part of an italian competition but was denied the monetary prize due to its catapult launch in 1932 enea bossi heard of an airplane which had successfully flown while powered only by a engine this prompted bossi to calculate the minimum power that a manned aircraft would need to fly the calculation yielded a value of approximately which convinced bossi that human powered flight might be possible during a trip to philadelphia bossi tested the speed at which a glider would take off under tow the experiment consisted of hiring a professional bicyclist to tow a glider a spring scale was attached to the tow line to sense the force exerted by the bicyclist the results confirming that a speed at which the necessary lift could be obtained was indeed attainable this same experimental procedure was later repeated as part of the development of the gossamer condor and the gossamer albatross a second experiment conducted during a trip to paris involved a propeller driven bicycle designed by bossi the test rider achieved a speed of but one drawback was noted the gyroscopic effect of the propeller generated so much torque that the bicycle became unstable

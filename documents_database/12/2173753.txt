using the dynamic substructuring approach one is able to analyse the dynamic behaviour of substructures separately and to later on calculate the assembled dynamics using coupling procedures dynamic substructuring has several advantages over the analysis of the fully assembled system dynamic substructuring is particularly tailored to simulation of mechanical vibrations which has implications for many product aspects such as sound acoustics fatigue durability comfort and safety also dynamic substructuring is applicable to any scale of size and frequency it is therefore a widely used paradigm in industrial applications ranging from automotive and aerospace engineering to design of wind turbines and high tech precision machinery the roots of dynamic substructuring can be found in the field of domain decomposition in 1890 the mathematician hermann schwarz came up with an iterative procedure for domain decomposition which allows to solve for continuous coupled subdomains however many of the analytical models of coupled continuous subdomains do not have closed form solutions which led to discretization and approximation techniques such as the ritz method which is sometimes called the raleigh ritz method due the similarity between ritz s formulation and the raleigh ratio the boundary element method bem and the finite element method fem these

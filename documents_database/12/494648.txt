this is the only edge to edge tiling by regular convex polygons which contains an octagon it has schl fli symbol of t 4 4 conway calls it a truncated quadrille constructed as a truncation operation applied to a square tiling quadrille other names used for this pattern include mediterranean tiling and octagonal tiling which is often represented by smaller squares and nonregular octagons which alternate long and short edges there are 3 regular and 8 semiregular tilings in the plane there are two distinct uniform colorings of a truncated square tiling naming the colors by indices around a vertex 4 8 8 122 123 the truncated square tiling can be used as a circle packing placing equal diameter circles at the center of every point every circle is in contact with 3 other circles in the packing kissing number one variations on this pattern often called a mediterranean pattern is shown in stone tiles with smaller squares and diagonally aligned with the borders other variations stretch the squares or octagons the pythagorean tiling alternates large and small squares and may be seen as topologically identical to the truncated square tiling the squares are rotated 45 degrees and octagons are

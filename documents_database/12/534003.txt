for any x y x and any 0 1 then equivalently a convex function is any extended real valued function such that its epigraph is a convex set the convex conjugate of an extended real valued not necessarily convex function f x r is f x r where x is the dual space of x and the biconjugate of a function f x r is the conjugate of the conjugate typically written as f x r the biconjugate is useful for showing when strong or weak duality hold via the perturbation function for any x x the inequality f x f x follows from the fenchel young inequality for proper functions f f if and only if f is convex and lower semi continuous by fenchel moreau theorem a convex minimization primal problem is one of the form such that f x r is a convex function and m x is a convex set in optimization theory the duality principle states that optimization problems may be viewed from either of two perspectives the primal problem or the dual problem in general given two dual pairs separated locally convex spaces x x and y y then given the function f x

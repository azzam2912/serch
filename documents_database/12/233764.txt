the molecule is related to cyclohexane ring by replacement of one hydrogen atom by a hydroxyl group this compound exists as a deliquescent colorless solid with a camphor like odor which when very pure melts near room temperature billions of kilograms are produced annually mainly as a precursor to nylon cyclohexanol is produced by the oxidation of cyclohexane in air typically using cobalt catalysts this process co forms cyclohexanone and this mixture ka oil for ketone alcohol oil is the main feedstock for the production of adipic acid the oxidation involves radicals and the intermediacy of the hydroperoxide choh alternatively cyclohexanol can be produced by the hydrogenation of phenol this process can also be adjusted to favor the formation of cyclohexanone cyclohexanol undergoes the main reactions expected for a secondary alcohol oxidation gives cyclohexanone which is converted on a large scale in industry to the oxime a precursor to caprolactam as a laboratory exercise this oxidation can be effected with chromic acid esterification affords the commercially useful derivatives dicyclohexyladipate and dicyclohexylphthalate which are used as plasticizers heating in the presence of acid catalysts converts cyclohexanol to cyclohexene cyclohexanol has at least two solid phases one of them is a plastic

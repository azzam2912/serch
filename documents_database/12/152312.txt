it is the unique such function which is holomorphic away from a simple pole at the cusp such that rational functions of are modular and in fact give all modular functions classically the invariant was studied as a parameterization of elliptic curves over but it also has surprising connections to the symmetries of the monster group this connection is referred to as monstrous moonshine the invariant can be defined as a function on the upper half plane where this can be motivated by viewing each as representing an isomorphism class of elliptic curves every elliptic curve over is a complex torus and thus can be identified with a rank 2 lattice that is a two dimensional lattice of this lattice can be rotated and scaled operations that preserve the isomorphism class so that it is generated by and this lattice corresponds to the elliptic curve formula 6 see weierstrass elliptic functions note that is defined everywhere in as the modular discriminant is non zero this is due to the corresponding cubic polynomial having distinct roots it can be shown that is a modular form of weight twelve and one of weight four so that its third power is also of

tsien is a neuroscientist who pioneered cre lox neurogenetics in the mid 1990s a versatile toolbox for neuroscientists to study the complex relationships between genes neural circuits and behaviors he is also known as the creator of the smart mouse doogie in the late 1990s while being a faculty member at princeton university recently he developed the theory of connectivity in an effort to explain the origin of intelligence or the basic design principle underlying brain computation and intelligence the theory states that brain computation is organized by a power of two based permutation logic in constructing cell assemblies the basic building blocks of neural circuits the theory has received initial validation from experiments the discovery of this basic computational logic of the brain can have important implications for the development of artificial general intelligence tsien earned his a b in biology physiology from east china normal university in shanghai 1984 and his ph d in molecular biology from the university of minnesota in 1990 he completed two postdoctoral fellowships with two nobel laureates dr eric kandel at columbia university and dr susumu tonegawa at mit in 1997 he became a faculty member in the department of molecular biology at

it is a 137 residue polypeptide encoded by the igj gene the j chain s molecular weight is approximately 15 kda it exhibits a standard immunoglobulin folding structure of two pleated sheets of four ribbons folded against one another it has 8 cystine residues two of these residues link the chains of iga or the chains of igm via disulfide bridges effectively serving as the glue between two fc regions of the antibody the j chain shows a large degree of homology between avian and human species suggesting that it serves an important function the j chain is required for igm or iga to be secreted into mucosa as part of a polymeric immunoglobulin pig the j chain is essential for binding of pig to the pigr which forms the secretory component upon excretion of the secretory pig by epithelial cells this binding facilitates transport of the j chain positive pig molecules from the basal to the apical sides of epithelial cells because igm and iga are the only two types of antibody that polymerize initial hypotheses stated that j chain was required for polymerization however it was subsequently found that igm is able to polymerize in the absence of

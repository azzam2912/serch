this enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses the isomerase has now been observed in nearly a hundred species of bacteria xylose isomerases are also commonly called fructose isomerases due to their ability to interconvert glucose and fructose the systematic name of this enzyme class is d xylose aldose ketose isomerase other names in common use include d xylose isomerase d xylose ketoisomerase and d xylose ketol isomerase the activity of d xylose isomerase was first observed by mitsuhashi and lampen in 1953 in the bacterium lactobacillus pentosus artificial production through transformed e coli have also been successful in 1957 the d xylose isomerase activity on d glucose conversion to d fructose was noted by kooi and marshall it is now known that isomerases have broad substrate specificity most pentoses and some hexoses are all substrates for d xylose isomerase some examples include d ribose l arabinose l rhanmose and d allose conversion of glucose to fructose by xylose isomerase was first patented in the 1960s however the process was not industrially viable as the enzymes were suspended in solution and recycling the enzyme was problematic an immobile xylose isomerase that was

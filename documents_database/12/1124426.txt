these bonds are in most cases part of a specific cys x x cys his cxxch binding motif where x denotes a miscellaneous amino acid two thioether bonds of cysteine residues bind to the vinyl sidechains of heme and the histidine residue coordinates one axial binding site of the heme iron less common binding motifs can include a single thioether linkage a lysine or a methionine instead of the axial histidine or a cxch binding motif with n 2 the second axial site of the iron can be coordinated by amino acids of the protein substrate molecules or water cytochromes c possess a wide range of properties and function as electron transfer proteins or catalyse chemical reactions involving redox processes a prominent member of this family is mitochondrial cytochrome c cytochrome c proteins can be divided in four classes based on their size number of heme groups and reduction potentials small soluble cytochrome c proteins with a molecular weight of 8 12 kda and a single heme group belong to class i it includes the low spin soluble cytc of mitochondria and bacteria with the heme attachment site located towards the n terminus and the sixth ligand provided by a

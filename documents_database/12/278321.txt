only one species rapetosaurus krausei has been identified like other sauropods rapetosaurus was a quadrupedal herbivore it is calculated to have reached lengths of 15 metres 49 ft rapetosaurus was a fairly typical sauropod with a short and slender tail a very long neck and a huge elephant like body its head resembles the head of a diplodocid with a long narrow snout and nostrils on the top of its skull it was a herbivore and its small pencil like teeth were good for ripping the leaves off trees but not for chewing it was fairly modest in size for a titanosaur the juvenile specimen measured from head to tail and probably weighed about as much as an elephant an adult would have been about twice as long in length which is still less than half the length of its gigantic kin like argentinosaurus and paralititan the discovery of rapetosaurus known by the single species rapetosaurus krausei marked the first time a titanosaur had been recovered with an almost perfectly intact skeleton complete with skull it has helped to clarify some difficult century old classification issues among this large group of sauropod dinosaurs and provides a good baseline for the

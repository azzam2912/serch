some examples are rhodopsin in the photoreceptor cells of the vertebrate retina phytochrome in plants and bacteriorhodopsin and bacteriophytochromes in some bacteria they mediate light responses as varied as visual perception phototropism and phototaxis as well as responses to light dark cycles such as circadian rhythm and other photoperiodisms including control of flowering times in plants and mating seasons in animals photoreceptor proteins typically consist of a protein moiety and a non protein photopigment that reacts to light via photoisomerization or photoreduction thus initiating a change of the receptor protein which triggers a signal transduction cascade pigments found in photoreceptors include retinal retinylidene proteins for example rhodopsin in animals flavin flavoproteins for example cryptochrome in plants and animals and bilin biliproteins for example phytochrome in plants also see photoreceptor cell all the photoreceptors listed above allow plants to sense light with wavelengths range from 280 nm uv b to 750 nm far red light plants can use light with different wavelengths as their environment cue for the initiation of important developmental transitions in plant seeds the photoreceptor phytochrome is responsible for the process termed photomorphogenesis this occurs when a seed initially situated in an environment of complete darkness is exposed

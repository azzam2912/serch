the driver software is typically provided with an operating system of a personal computer but may also be implemented by application specific devices such as a microcontroller on the expansion card or motherboard controller this involves much custom logic with digital logic engines in the motherboard s controller chip plus analog circuitry managing the high speed differential signals on the software side it requires a device driver called a host controller driver or hcd open host controller interface ohci is an open standard when applied to a ieee 1394 also known as firewire i link or lynx card ohci means that the card supports a standard interface to the pc and can be used by the ohci ieee 1394 drivers that come with all modern operating systems because the card has a standard ohci interface the os does not need to know in advance exactly who makes the card or how it works it can safely assume that the card understands the set of well defined commands that are defined in the standard protocol the ohci standard for usb is similar to the ohci standard for ieee 1394 but supports usb 1 1 full and low speeds only so as

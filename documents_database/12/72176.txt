it can be shown that such a factorization is then necessarily unique up to the order of the factors there are at least three other characterizations of dedekind domains that are sometimes taken as the definition see below a field is a commutative ring in which there are no nontrivial proper ideals so that any field is a dedekind domain however in a rather vacuous way some authors add the requirement that a dedekind domain not be a field many more authors state theorems for dedekind domains with the implicit proviso that they may require trivial modifications for the case of fields an immediate consequence of the definition is that every principal ideal domain pid is a dedekind domain in fact a dedekind domain is a unique factorization domain ufd if and only if it is a pid in the 19th century it became a common technique to gain insight into integral solutions of polynomial equations using rings of algebraic numbers of higher degree for instance fix a positive integer formula 1 in the attempt to determine which integers are represented by the quadratic form formula 2 it is natural to factor the quadratic form into formula 3 the factorization

relative to simple linear regression ngr uses the ensemble spread as an additional predictor which is used to improve the prediction of uncertainty and allows the predicted uncertainty to vary from case to case the prediction of uncertainty in ngr is derived from both past forecast errors statistics and the ensemble spread ngr was originally developed for site specific medium range temperature forecasting but has since also been applied to site specific medium range wind forecasting and to seasonal forecasts and has been adapted for precipitation forecasting the introduction of ngr was the first demonstration that probabilistic forecasts that take account of the varying ensemble spread could achieve better skill scores than forecasts based on standard model output statistics approaches applied to the ensemble mean weather forecasts generated by computer simulations of the atmosphere and ocean typically consist of an ensemble of individual forecasts ensembles are used as a way to attempt to capture and quantify the uncertainties in the weather forecasting process such as uncertainty in the initial conditions and uncertainty in the parameterisations in the model for point forecasts of normally distributed variables one can summarize an ensemble forecast with the mean and the standard deviation of the

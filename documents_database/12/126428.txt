absolute deviation only of a data set is the average of the absolute deviations or the positive difference of the given data and that certain value generally central values it is a summary statistic of statistical dispersion or variability in the general form the central point can be the mean median mode or the result of any other measure of central tendency or any random data point related to the given data set the absolute values of the difference between the data points and their central tendency are totaled and divided by the number of data points several measures of statistical dispersion are defined in terms of the absolute deviation the term average absolute deviation does not uniquely identify a measure of statistical dispersion as there are several measures that can be used to measure absolute deviations and there are several measures of central tendency that can be used as well thus to uniquely identify the absolute deviation it is necessary to specify both the measure of deviation and the measure of central tendency unfortunately the statistical literature has not yet adopted a standard notation as both the mean absolute deviation around the mean and the median absolute deviation around

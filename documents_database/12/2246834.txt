tris dimethylamino methane can be regarded as both an amine and an orthoamide tris dimethylamino methane is a strong base and can be used as a formylation agent as aminomethylenation reagent and as a source for the basic bis dimethylamino carbene of the formula rn c tris dimethylamino methane is formed in the reaction of n n n n tetramethylformamidinium chloride tmf cl or bis dimethylamino acetonitrile with lithium dimethylamide or sodium dimethylamide with yields between 55 and 84 from dimethylamine and trimethoxyborane sodium dimethylamide is formed in situ in the presence of sodium hydride which reacts with n n n n tetramethylformamidinium chloride in 84 yield to tris dimethylamino methane and with bis dimethylamino acetonitrile in 77 yield the reaction of the dimethylformamide dmf dimethylacetal hc och n ch from the dmf dimethyl sulfate complex and sodium methoxide with dimethylamine in the presence of the acidic catalyst 2 4 6 tri tert butylphenol which is largely stable to the alkylating agent produces tris dimethylamino methane tris dimethylamino methane is formed in good yield 83 in the reaction of dmf with tetrakis dimethylamino titanium iv n n n n n n hexamethylguanidinium chloride readily obtainable by dimethylamine and n n

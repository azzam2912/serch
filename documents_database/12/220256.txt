most protractors measure angles in degrees radian scale protractors measure angles in radians most protractors are divided into 180 equal parts some precision protractors further divide degrees into arcminutes they are used for a variety of mechanical and engineering related applications one common use is in geometry lessons in schools some protractors are simple half discs more advanced protractors such as the bevel protractor have one or two swinging arms which can be used to help measure the angle a bevel protractor is a graduated circular protractor with one pivoted arm used for measuring or marking off angles sometimes vernier scales are attached to give more precise readings it has wide application in architectural and mechanical drawing although its use is decreasing with the availability of modern drawing software or cad universal bevel protractors are also used by toolmakers as they measure angles by mechanical contact they are classed as mechanical protractors the bevel protractor is used to establish and test angles to very close tolerances it reads to 5 arcminutes 5 or and can measure angles from 0 to 360 the bevel protractor consists of a beam a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a swivel

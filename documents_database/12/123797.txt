henipaviruses are naturally harboured by pteropid fruit bats flying foxes and microbats of several species henipaviruses are characterised by long genomes and a wide host range their recent emergence as zoonotic pathogens capable of causing illness and death in domestic animals and humans is a cause of concern in 2009 rna sequences of three novel viruses in phylogenetic relationship to known henipaviruses were detected in african straw colored fruit bats eidolon helvum in ghana the finding of these novel henipaviruses outside australia and asia indicates that the region of potential endemicity of henipaviruses may be worldwide these african henipaviruses are slowly being characterised henipavirions are pleomorphic variably shaped ranging in size from 40 to 600 nm in diameter they possess a lipid membrane overlying a shell of viral matrix protein at the core is a single helical strand of genomic rna tightly bound to n nucleocapsid protein and associated with the l large and p phosphoprotein proteins which provide rna polymerase activity during replication embedded within the lipid membrane are spikes of f fusion protein trimers and g attachment protein tetramers the function of the g protein is to attach the virus to the surface of a host cell via

epigenetic modifications are heritable alterations that are not due to changes in the sequence of nucleotides epigenetic modifications such as histone modifications and dna methylation alter the accessibility to dna and change chromatin structure thereby regulating patterns of gene expression methylated histones can act as binding sites for certain transcription factors due to their bromodomains and chromodomains methylated histones can also prevent the binding of transcription factors by hiding the transcription factor s recognition site which is usually found on the major groove of dna the methyl groups bound to the cytosine residues lie in the major groove of dna the same region most transcription factors use to read a dna sequence a common epigenetic tag found in dna is the covalent attachment of a methyl group to the c5 position of the cytosine found in cpg dinucleotide sequences cpg methylation is an important mechanism of transcriptional silencing methylation of cpg islands is shown to reduce gene expression by the formation of tightly condensed heterochromatin that is transcriptionally inactive cpg sites in a gene are most commonly found in the promoter regions of a gene while also being present in non promoter regions the cpg sites in non promoter regions

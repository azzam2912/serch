it is named after fortuna the roman goddess of chance fortuna is a family of secure prngs its design leaves some choices open to implementors it is composed of the following pieces the generator is based on any good block cipher practical cryptography suggests aes serpent or twofish the basic idea is to run the cipher in counter mode encrypting successive values of an incrementing counter with a 128 bit block cipher this would produce statistically identifiable deviations from randomness for instance generating 2 genuinely random 128 bit blocks would produce on average about one pair of identical blocks but there are no repeated blocks at all among the first 2 produced by a 128 bit cipher in counter mode therefore the key is changed periodically no more than 1 mib of data 2 128 bit blocks is generated without a key change the book points out that block ciphers with a 256 bit or greater block size which did not enjoy much popularity at the time do not have this statistical problem one example of a block cipher with this property is chacha20 the key is also changed after every data request however small so that a future key

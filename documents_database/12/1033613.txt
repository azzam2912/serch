this inconsistency arises because subjective human interpretation is necessary to compare the 28s and 18s gel images the rin algorithm was devised to overcome this issue the rin algorithm is applied to electrophoretic rna measurements typically obtained using capillary gel electrophoresis and based on a combination of different features that contribute information about the rna integrity to provide a more universal measure rin has been demonstrated to be robust and reproducible in studies comparing it to other rna integrity calculation algorithms cementing its position as a preferred method of determining the quality of rna to be analyzed a major criticism to rin is when using with plants or in studies of eukaryotic prokaryotic cells interactions the rin algorithm is unable to differentiate eukaryotic prokaryotic chloroplastic ribosomal rna creating serious quality index underestimation in such situations electrophoresis is the process of separating nucleic acid species based on their length by applying an electric field to them as nucleic acids are negatively charged they are pushed by an electric field through a matrix usually an agarose gel with the smaller molecules being pushed farther faster capillary electrophoresis is a technique whereby small amounts of a nucleic acid sample can be run on

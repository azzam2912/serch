it is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance it arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites such as sodium if the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high structures in the brain detect changes in blood constituents and signal thirst continuous dehydration can cause acute and chronic diseases but is most often associated with renal and neurological disorders excessive thirst called polydipsia along with excessive urination known as polyuria may be an indication of diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus there are receptors and other systems in the body that detect a decreased volume or an increased osmolite concentration some sources distinguish extracellular thirst from intracellular thirst where extracellular thirst is thirst generated by decreased volume and intracellular thirst is thirst generated by increased osmolite concentration it is vital for organisms to be able to maintain their fluid levels in very narrow ranges the goal is to keep the interstitial fluid the fluid outside the cell at the same concentration as the intracellular fluid fluid inside the cell this condition is called isotonic and occurs when the same level of solutes are

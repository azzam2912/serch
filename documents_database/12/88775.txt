with an inner product on the tangent space at each point that varies smoothly from point to point this gives in particular local notions of angle length of curves surface area and volume from those some other global quantities can be derived by integrating local contributions riemannian geometry originated with the vision of bernhard riemann expressed in his inaugural lecture ueber die hypothesen welche der geometrie zu grunde liegen on the hypotheses on which geometry is based it is a very broad and abstract generalization of the differential geometry of surfaces in r development of riemannian geometry resulted in synthesis of diverse results concerning the geometry of surfaces and the behavior of geodesics on them with techniques that can be applied to the study of differentiable manifolds of higher dimensions it enabled the formulation of einstein s general theory of relativity made profound impact on group theory and representation theory as well as analysis and spurred the development of algebraic and differential topology riemannian geometry was first put forward in generality by bernhard riemann in the 19th century it deals with a broad range of geometries whose metric properties vary from point to point including the standard types of non

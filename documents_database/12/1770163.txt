the abell catalogue was published by george o abell in 1958 while working on his phd at california institute of technology the catalogue has two different surveys the northern survey was done first by abell in 1958 with the help of a g wilson the northern survey has 2 712 clusters and in order for a cluster to be put into the catalogue it must pass four criteria the first criterion is richness and abell divided the clusters into 6 different richness groups group 0 was 30 49 galaxies group 1 was 50 79 galaxies group 2 was 80 129 galaxies group 3 was 130 to 199 galaxies group 4 was 200 299 galaxies and group 5 was more than 299 galaxies the second criterion was compactness to meet this requirement a cluster must have 50 or more members in one counting radius of the cluster s center the third criterion is distance a cluster must have a nominal redshift between 02 and 2 which means a recessional velocity is between 6 000 and 60 000 km s the fourth and final criterion was galactic latitude areas around the milky way were excluded because it was difficult to identify galaxy

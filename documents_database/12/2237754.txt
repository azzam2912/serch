it has a complicated taxonomic history and different authors vary in which birds they include in the family it includes the quail thrushes and jewel babblers the quail thrushes jewel babblers whipbirds and wedgebills were traditionally included with the logrunners orthonyx in the family orthonychidae sometimes the malaysian rail babbler and blue capped ifrit ifrita kowaldi were also included in the family in 1985 sibley and ahlquist found that the logrunners were not related to the others and included only the logrunners in the orthonychidae they treated the others as the subfamily cinclosomatinae within their expanded family corvidae a number of authors later treated the quail thrushes and allies as the family cinclosomatidae a name first coined by gregory mathews in 1921 1922 however if the whipbirds are included in the family the older name psophodidae has priority if the malaysian rail babbler is also included the name eupetidae has priority the malaysian rail babbler has now been shown to be unrelated to the others probably being an early offshoot of the passerida another study found the quail thrushes and jewel babblers to be related to each other but did not show them to have a close relationship with psophodes

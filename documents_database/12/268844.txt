it will be the first robot arm able to work on the russian space station segments and will supplement the two russian strela cargo cranes that are already installed on the pirs module the era is designed and assembled by airbus defence and space netherlands formerly dutch space the era has several interesting features most prominent are its ability to walk around the exterior of the russian segments of the station under its own control moving hand over hand between pre fixed basepoints and its ability to perform many tasks automatically or semi automatically thereby freeing its operators to do other work specific tasks of era include the international space station already features three robotic arms the first being the canadarm2 but because the russian grapple fixtures are different that arm and dextre can only be used on the zarya module of the russian segment the third arm is fixed on the japanese experiment module the remote manipulator system jem rms uses a similar grapple fixture to canadarm2 because all russian and european spacecraft dock automatically there is no need to manipulate spacecraft on the russian segment so the european arm is half the length and less powerful than canadarm2

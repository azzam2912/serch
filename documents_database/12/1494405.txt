to contemporaries outside of sparta spartan women had a reputation for promiscuity and controlling their husbands unlike their athenian counterparts spartan women could legally own and inherit property and they were usually better educated the extant written sources are limited and from a largely non spartan viewpoint as anton powell puts it to say that the written sources are not without problems as an understatement would be hard to beat sparta is one of only three states in ancient greece along with athens and gortyn for which any detailed information about the role of women survives this evidence is mostly from the classical period and later but much of the laws and customs we know of probably dates back to the archaic period the earliest sources of evidence about the lives of spartan women come from archaic greek poetry such as the maiden songs of alcman a lydian poet who lived and worked in sparta in the seventh century bc however the literary sources which give us the most information about women s lives in sparta are all later and written exclusively by non spartans non literary sources including archaeology and ancient art are limited according to plutarch s testimony

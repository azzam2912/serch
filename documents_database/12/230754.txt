dicynodonts were herbivorous animals with two tusks hence their name which means two dog tooth they are also the most successful and diverse of the non mammalian therapsids with over 70 genera known varying from rat to elephant sized the dicynodont skull is highly specialised light but strong with the synapsid temporal openings at the rear of the skull greatly enlarged to accommodate larger jaw muscles the front of the skull and the lower jaw are generally narrow and in all but a number of primitive forms toothless instead the front of the mouth is equipped with a horny beak as in turtles and ceratopsian dinosaurs food was processed by the retraction of the lower jaw when the mouth closed producing a powerful shearing action which would have enabled dicynodonts to cope with tough plant material many genera also have a pair of tusks which it is thought may have been an example of sexual dimorphism the body is short strong and barrel shaped with strong limbs in large genera such as dinodontosaurus the hindlimbs were held erect but the forelimbs bent at the elbow both the pectoral girdle and the ilium are large and strong the tail is short

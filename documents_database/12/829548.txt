froswick is shorter in stature than either of its neighbours and also has no obvious route of direct ascent for these reasons it is often seen merely as a stopping point on the ill bell ridge or the longer kentmere horseshoe walk froswick also apes the form of ill bell to a surprising degree particularly when the ridge is viewed in profile the western troutbeck side is steep and smooth except for the ravine of blue gill this rends the fellside from top to bottom and is a feeder of hagg gill the kentmere flank is rougher and falls in fans of scree to the river kent just above kentmere reservoir topographically froswick has one feature which ill bell lacks a subsidiary ridge starting out southwards from halfway down the western side a narrow wedge of high ground pushes out into the troutbeck valley separating trout beck from its main tributary hagg gill is the modest height of troutbeck tongue the ridges north and south from froswick are both narrow and airy northwards a ruined fence is followed above the crags of wander scar before the ridge broadens onto the summit plateau of thornthwaite crag the transit to ill bell

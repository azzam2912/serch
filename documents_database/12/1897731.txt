neural implants have the potential to increase the quality of life for patients with such disabilities as alzheimer s parkinson s epilepsy depression and migraines with the complexity of interfaces between a neural implant and brain tissue adverse reactions such as fibrous tissue encapsulation that hinder the functionality occur surface modifications to these implants can help improve the tissue implant interface increasing the lifetime and effectiveness of the implant intracranial electrodes consist of conductive electrode arrays implanted on a polymer or silicon or a wire electrode with an exposed tip and insulation everywhere that stimulation or recording is not desired biocompatibility is essential for the entire implant but special attention is paid to the actual electrodes since they are the site producing the desired function one main physiological issue that current long term implanted electrodes suffer from are fibrous glial encapsulations after implantation this encapsulation is due to the poor biocompatibility and biostability integration at the hard electrode and soft tissue interface of many neural electrodes being used today the encapsulation causes a reduced signal intensity because of the increased electrical impedance and decreased charge transfer between the electrode and the tissue the encapsulation causes decreased efficiency performance and durability

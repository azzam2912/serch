the amount of conduction convection or radiation of an object determines the amount of heat it transfers increasing the temperature gradient between the object and the environment increasing the convection heat transfer coefficient or increasing the surface area of the object increases the heat transfer sometimes it is not feasible or economical to change the first two options thus adding a fin to an object increases the surface area and can sometimes be an economical solution to heat transfer problems one piece finned heat sinks are produced by extrusion casting skiving or milling to create a tractable equation for the heat transfer of a fin many assumptions need to be made with these assumptions conservation of energy can be used to create an energy balance for a differential cross section of the fin fourier s law states that where formula 3 is the cross sectional area of the differential element furthermore the convective heat flux can be determined via the definition of the heat transfer coefficient h where formula 5 is the temperature of the surroundings the differential convective heat flux can then be determined from the perimeter of the fin cross section p the equation of energy conservation can

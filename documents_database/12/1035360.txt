they combine methods with a high level of theory and a small basis set with methods that employ lower levels of theory with larger basis sets they are commonly used to calculate thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpies of formation atomization energies ionization energies and electron affinities they aim for chemical accuracy which is usually defined as within 1 kcal mol of the experimental value the first systematic model chemistry of this type with broad applicability was called gaussian 1 g1 introduced by john pople this was quickly replaced by the gaussian 2 g2 which has been used extensively the gaussian 3 g3 was introduced later the g2 uses seven calculations the various energy changes are assumed to be additive so the combined energy is given by the second term corrects for the effect of adding the polarization functions the third term corrects for the diffuse functions the final term corrects for the larger basis set with the terms from steps 2 3 and 4 preventing contributions from being counted twice two final corrections are made to this energy the zpve is scaled by 0 8929 an empirical correction is then added to account for factors not considered above this is

most physicists believe that faster than light particles cannot exist because they are not consistent with the known laws of physics if such particles did exist they could be used to build a tachyonic antitelephone and send signals faster than light which according to special relativity would lead to violations of causality no experimental evidence for the existence of such particles has been found the possibility of particles moving faster than light was first proposed by robert ehrilch and arnold sommerfeld independently of each other in the 1967 paper that coined the term gerald feinberg proposed that tachyonic particles could be quanta of a quantum field with imaginary mass however it was soon realized that excitations of such imaginary mass fields do not under any circumstances propagate faster than light and instead the imaginary mass gives rise to an instability known as tachyon condensation nevertheless in modern physics the term tachyon often refers to imaginary mass fields rather than to faster than light particles such fields have come to play a significant role in modern physics the term comes from the tachy meaning rapid the complementary particle types are called luxons which always move at the speed of light and

the domain forms a compact globular structure composed of nine alpha helices connected by loops of varying length the general topology is determined by three helical hairpins that are stacked consecutively with a right hand twist an n terminal helix folds back forming a deep basic groove that forms the binding pocket for the ins 1 4 5 p3 ligand the lipid ligand is coordinated by residues from surrounding alpha helices and all three phosphates are multiply coordinated proteins containing this domain have been found to bind ptdins 4 5 p2 and ins 1 4 5 p3 suggesting that the domain is a membrane interacting module the main function of proteins containing this domain appears to be to act as accessory clathrin adaptors in endocytosis epsin is able to recruit and promote clathrin polymerisation on a lipid monolayer but may have additional roles in signalling and actin regulation epsin causes a strong degree of membrane curvature and tubulation even fragmentation of membranes with a high ptdins 4 5 p2 content epsin binding to membranes facilitates their deformation by insertion of the n terminal helix into the inner leaflet of the bilayer pushing the head groups apart this would reduce the

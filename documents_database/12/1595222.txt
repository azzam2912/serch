it has been formed as one of a number of other molecular scandium hydride products at low temperature using laser ablation and identified by infrared spectroscopy scandium trihydride has recently been the subject of dirac hartree fock relativistic calculation studies which investigate the stabilities geometries and relative energies of hydrides of the formula mh mh or mh scandium trihydride is a quastrigonal planar molecule with three equivalent sc h bonds c structure an equilibrium distance between sc and hydrogen of 182 0 pm the bond angle is 119 2 degrees by weight percent the composition of scandium trihydride is 6 30 hydrogen and 93 70 scandium in scandium trihydride the formal oxidation states of hydrogen and scandium are 1 an 3 respectively because of the electronegativity of scandium is lower than that of hydrogen the stability of metal hydrides with the formula mh m sc lu increases as the atomic number of m increases early theoretical studies of sch revealed that the molecule is unstable the bulk substance is likely to be a colourless gas with a low activation energy toward the conversion into trimeric clusters due to the electron deficient nature of the monomer not unlike the group 13

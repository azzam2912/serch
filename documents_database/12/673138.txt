it is visible to the naked eye as a faint blue white hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 5 14 the visual magnitude of the star is diminished by an extinction of 0 22 due to interstellar dust it is moving further from the earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of 3 km s 42 camelopardalis has a peculiar velocity of and may be a runaway star observations made in 1933 appeared to suggest this could be a beta cephei variable but this was not confirmed by follow up measurements the star has a stellar classification of b4 iv matching a b type subgiant star it has 6 5 times the mass of the sun and about 5 6 times the sun s radius 42 camelopardalis is 50 million years old with a high rotation rate showing a projected rotational velocity of 105 km s it is radiating 2 460 times the luminosity of the sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 16 550 k this star is notable as demonstrating similarities between the short period b type variables and the cepheid variables

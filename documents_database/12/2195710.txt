the album was released on 1 june 2008 just prior to his induction into the aria hall of fame the album is a collaboration between morris and australian musician peter robinson who co wrote numerous tracks and was the co producer and designer of the sleeve robinson plays multiple instruments including guitar bass piano and strings and provided backing vocals in an interview with the music au in 2013 morris said the album had been received with a collective yawn natalie salvo from the dwarf said the thirteen songs are a little rough n ready as morris vocals cannot always hit the high notes of his youth however judging by the slick production the songs have the makings of being triple m favourites in all it is commercial rock that is often quite easy on the ear and presented either in its finery or blandness depending on which side of the fence you sit on she added the album does overstay its welcome and could have possibly been improved with a few less songs and while it is no the real thing it does serve to prove that we do not need this song to be re done or rehashed

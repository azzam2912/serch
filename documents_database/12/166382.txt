it binds to its receptor when the radioactive isotope in the ligand decays it can be measured by positron emission tomography pet or single photon emission computed tomography spect in in vivo systems it is often used to quantify the binding of a test molecule to the binding site of radioligand the higher the affinity of the molecule the more radioligand is displaced from the binding site and the increasing radioactive decay can be measured by scintillography this assay is commonly used to calculate binding constant of molecules to receptors the transport of the radioligand is described by receptor kinetics radioligands are credited with making possible the study of biomolecular behaviour a previously mysterious area of research that had evaded researchers with this capacity radioligand techniques enabled researchers to identify receptor devices within cells in pet the isotopes fluorine 18 carbon 11 and copper 64 are often used in molecular imaging radioligands may be constructed to bind selectively to a particular neuroreceptor or a particular neurotransmitter transporter examples of radioligands include

the ancient greeks and the spartans in particular are said to have used this cipher to communicate during military campaigns the recipient uses a rod of the same diameter on which the parchment is wrapped to read the message it has the advantage of being fast and not prone to mistakes a necessary property when on the battlefield it can however be easily broken since the strip of parchment hints strongly at the method the ciphertext would have to be transferred to something less suggestive somewhat reducing the advantage noted suppose the rod allows one to write four letters around in a circle and five letters down the side of it the plaintext could be i am hurt very badly help to encrypt one simply writes across the leather so the ciphertext becomes iryyatbhmvaehedlurlp after unwinding to decrypt all one must do is wrap the leather strip around the rod and read across the ciphertext is iryyatbhmvaehedlurlp every fifth letter will appear on the same line so the plaintext after re insertion of spaces becomes i am hurt very badly help from indirect evidence the scytale was first mentioned by the greek poet archilochus who lived in the 7th century

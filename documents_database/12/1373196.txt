to obtain the required quality on one hand the resin system has to be developed and optimized accordingly on the other hand the resin dispensing system has to work more and more precisely to obtain best dispensing because of continuously increasing cost pressure casting devices must be capable of increased quality while also becoming faster and more reliable first of all by dispensing electrical and electronic parts have to be insulated reliably and penetration of moisture has to be excluded totally very often heat has to be conducted out from the part properly an attribute that can be improved by the choice of an appropriate resin e g epoxy polyurethane or silicone in a dispensing system the following processes have to be performed a good resin dispensing system provides high quality casting of the same high standard even during long series in mass production several properties of the resin mix with or without filler material one component or two components resin hardener are crucial for the quality of the product even distribution of the fillers without setting is maintained by ongoing stirring air and moisture are eliminated by evacuating the material tanks elevated temperature is reached and maintained by thoroughly

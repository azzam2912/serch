psilomelane consists of hydrous manganese oxide with variable amounts of barium and potassium psilomelane is erroneously and uncommonly known as black hematite despite not being related to true hematite which is an iron oxide generalized formula may be represented as ba mn mn o oh or as ba ho mno it is sometimes considered to be a hydrous manganese manganate but of doubtful composition the amount of manganese present corresponds to 70 80 of manganous oxide with 10 15 of available oxygen psilomelane is amorphous and occurs as botryoidal and stalactitic masses with a smooth shining surface and submetallic lustre the mineral is readily distinguished from other hydrous manganese oxides manganite and wad by its greater hardness 5 to 6 the specific gravity varies from 3 7 to 4 7 the streak is brownish black and the fracture smooth owing to its amorphous nature the mineral often contains admixed impurities such as iron hydroxides it is soluble in hydrochloric acid with evolution of chlorine gas the name has reference to this characteristic appearance from the greek for naked smooth and black a latinized form is calvonigrite it is a common and important ore of manganese occurring under the same conditions

pombe also known as sgol2 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the sgol2 gene shugoshin like 2 sgol2 is one of the two mammalian orthologs of the shugoshin mei s322 family of proteins that regulate sister chromatid cohesion by protecting the integrity of a multiprotein complex named cohesin this protective system is essential for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis which is the physical basis of mendelian inheritance model organisms have been used in the study of sgol2 function a conditional knockout mouse line called sgol2 was generated as part of the international knockout mouse consortium program a high throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists at the wellcome trust sanger institute male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion twenty two tests were carried out on mutant mice but no significant abnormalities were observed using another genetically engineered mouse that lacks sgol2 function and sirna experiments in oocytes it has been shown that disruption of the mouse sgol2 does not cause any alteration in sister chromatid cohesion in embryonic cultured fibroblasts and adult somatic tissues moreover although these mutant mice also

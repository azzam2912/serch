the type strain of t elfii is sebr 6459 the genus thermotoga was originally thought to be strictly found surrounding submarine hydrothermal vents but this organism was subsequently isolated in african oil wells in 1995 a protective outer sheath allows this microbe to be thermophilic this organism cannot function in the presence of oxygen making it strictly anaerobic some research proposes that the thiosulfate reducing qualities in this organism could lead to decreased bio corrosion in oil equipment in industrial settings the genus thermotoga previously thought only to be found around submarine hydrothermal vents was discovered in north sea oil wells due to this discovery other wells in the area began being investigated leading to the discovery of thermotoga elfii in african oil wells in april 1995 t elfii was gathered in a one liter sample at the head of a well at 68 c ravot et al isolated this species by cultivation on a basal medium containing numerous different nutrients and resources water salt glucose sodium acetate etc in the lab and then by using repeated trials of the agar shake dilution technique these scientists concluded by determining the samples purity through microscopy the first name of thermotoga elfii

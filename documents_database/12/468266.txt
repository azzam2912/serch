a set a of natural numbers is said to be one one reducible to a set b if there is a total computable injection f on the natural numbers such that formula 1 and formula 2 myhill s isomorphism theorem states that two sets a and b of natural numbers are recursively isomorphic if and only if a is one reducible to b and b is one reducible to a the theorem is reminiscent of the schroeder bernstein theorem the proof is different however the proof of schroeder bernstein uses the inverses of the two injections which is impossible in the setting of the myhill theorem since these inverses might not be recursive the proof of the myhill theorem on the other hand defines the bijection inductively which is impossible in the setting of schroeder bernstein unless one uses the axiom of choice which is not necessary for the proof a corollary of myhill s theorem is that two total numberings are one equivalent if and only if they are computably isomorphic

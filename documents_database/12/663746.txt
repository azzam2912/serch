drug carriers are primarily used to control the release of a drug into systemic circulation this can be accomplished either by slow release of the drug over a long period of time typically diffusion or by triggered release at the drug s target by some stimulus such as changes in ph application of heat and activation by light drug carriers are also used to improve the pharmacokinetic properties specifically the bioavailability of many drugs with poor water solubility and or membrane permeability a wide variety of drug carrier systems have been developed and studied each of which has unique advantages and disadvantages some of the more popular types of drug carriers include liposomes polymeric micelles microspheres and nanoparticles different methods of attaching the drug to the carrier have been implemented including adsorption integration into the bulk structure encapsulation and covalent bonding different types of drug carrier utilize different methods of attachment and some carriers can even implement a variety of attachment methods liposomes are structures which consist of at least one lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core this hydrophobic hydrophilic composition is particularly useful for drug delivery as these carriers can accommodate a number of drugs of varying lipophilicity disadvantages

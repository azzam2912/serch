the first few values are given by the relationship between zeta at the positive even integers and the bernoulli numbers may be written as where formula 13 and formula 14 are integers for all even formula 15 these are given by the integer sequences and respectively in oeis some of these values are reproduced below if we let formula 16 be the coefficient of formula 17 as above then we find recursively this recurrence relation may be derived from that for the bernoulli numbers also there is another recurrence which can be proved using that formula 21 the values of the zeta function at non negative even integers have the generating function since the formula also shows that for formula 24 for the first few odd natural numbers one has it is known that 3 is irrational ap ry s theorem and that infinitely many of the numbers 2 n 1 n n are irrational there are also results on the irrationality of values of the riemann zeta function at the elements of certain subsets of the positive odd integers for example at least one of 5 7 9 or 11 is irrational the positive odd integers of the zeta

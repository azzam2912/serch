the chloroalkane class alkanes with one or more hydrogens substituted by chlorine provides common examples the wide structural variety and divergent chemical properties of organochlorides lead to a broad range of names and applications organochlorides are very useful compounds in many applications but some are of profound environmental concern chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways the compounds are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen aliphatic organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group many organochlorine compounds have been isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans chlorinated organic compounds are found in nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids terpenes amino acids flavonoids steroids and fatty acids organochlorides including dioxins are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires and dioxins have been found in the preserved ashes of lightning ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins in addition a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane chloroform and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae a majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition forest fires and volcanoes the natural organochloride epibatidine an alkaloid isolated from tree frogs

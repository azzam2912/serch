saurognathus from the ancestral dissacus species is its size ankalagon grew to be as large as a bear as compared to the coyote or jackal sized species of dissacus in fact the only north american mesonychids that surpassed ankalagon in size were the larger species of the early eocene genus pachyaena such as p gigantea and p ossifraga which too grew to the size of bears evidence of sexual dimorphism comes from an analysis of tooth and jaw size in two specimens of this genus compared with existing carnivora which are not closely related to mesonychids and where the size and sex of living individuals can be recorded and compared with their tooth size though the two ankalagon jaws are of very different sizes and one has much larger canines the first two molars are close to the same size as the size of the first two molars varies little in individuals of the same species even when body size is different the study suggests two conclusions first that these two adult individuals are the same species so ankalagon had significant sexual dimorphism second that size weight estimates of ankalagon and other fossil mammals with sexual dimorphism may not be

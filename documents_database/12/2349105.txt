established in 1850 it formed a farmer s railroad between the two cities in eastern north carolina as part of the plank road boom it allowed for fairly easy transportation for farm products and manufactured goods inland to the steamboat landing in greenville the construction of the plank roads was expensive and more difficult than thought state laws required the roads to be a minimum of eight feet and a maximum of sixty feet wide and that a secondary maintained dirt road run alongside the plank roads were to be used by heavy freight and teamsters while lighter carriages as well as individual riders and walkers would use the side road a fifteen man team could lay about 650 feet of plank road per day or about a mile in one week by 1857 enthusiasm for the project had waned and the plank road only reached between greenville and wilson north carolina the plank road when constructed from greenville to wilson cost about 1 453 00 per mile and followed the path of what would later become us 264 slave owners were paid 12 50 for the use of their slaves tolls of several cents a mile per horse rider

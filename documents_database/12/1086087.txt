it is a member of the ck1 formerly named casein kinase 1 family of serine threonine specific eukaryotic protein kinases encompassing seven distinct isoforms ck1 1 3 as well as various post transcriptionally processed splice variants transcription variants tvs in mammalians meanwhile ck1 homologous proteins have been isolated from organisms like yeast basidiomycetes plants algae and protozoa in 1993 the gene sequence of ck1 was initially described by graves et al who isolated the cdna from testicles of rats after sequencing and characterization of the gene the construct was described as a 1284 nucleotide sequence resulting in a protein consisting of 428 amino acids after transcription the molecular weight of the according protein was published as 49 kda three years later the same gene was identified in humans the human csnk1d contains 1245 nucleotides and is transcribed into a protein consisting of 415 amino acids ever since ck1 was investigated and described in various animals plants as well as parasites caenorhabditis elegans 1998 drosophila melanogaster 1998 mus musculus 2002 xenopus laevis 2002 so far three different transcription variants tvs have been described for ck1 in humans homo sapiens mice mus musculus and rats rattus norvegicus which are highly homologous the

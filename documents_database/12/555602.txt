building physics architectural science and applied physics are terms used for the knowledge domain that overlaps with building science building science traditionally includes the study of indoor thermal environment indoor acoustic environment indoor light environment indoor air quality and building resource use including energy and building material use these areas are studied in terms of physical principles relationship to building occupant health comfort and productivity and how they can be controlled by the building envelope and electrical and mechanical systems the national institute of building sciences nibs additionally includes the areas of building information modeling building commissioning fire protection engineering seismic design and resilient design within its scope the practical purpose of building science is to provide predictive capability to optimize the building performance and sustainability of new and existing buildings understand or prevent building failures and guide the design of new techniques and technologies during the architectural design process building science knowledge is used to inform design decisions to optimize building performance design decisions can be made based on knowledge of building science principles and established guidelines such as the nibs whole building design guide wbdg and the collection of ashrae standards related to building science computational tools can

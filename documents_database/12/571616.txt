research teams have unearthed more than 20 000 fossilized faunal bone fragments two hundred thousand year old cranial fragments of a nine year old juvenile found in the cave suggest the presence of either homo heidelbergensis or a proto neanderthal human occupation layers of the cave in use during marine isotopic stage 6 186 000 to 127 000 years ago were excavated during the 1970s and may demonstrate construction abilities and other organisational skills by the inhabitants at the time close to the mouth of the cave and along one wall were found acheulean stone tools along with fragments of animal bone surrounding two circular charcoal concentrations which likely served as hearths this occupation area measures and was delimited by the cave wall on three sides and on the fourth by a sinuous line of large stones it is these which have been interpreted as having served as packing stones that could have been used to support the poles of an animal skin tent pitched against the cave wall no evidence of the organic tent poles or tent itself would have survived but stone tool flakes and animal bone appear to spill outwards from between the stones at two points

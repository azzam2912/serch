it was a design exercise in using recycled material and hybrid technology it was powered by a hybrid electric and gas turbine engine many of its lines and general styling were used as inspiration for the first generation volvo s80 the ecc set a new design language for future volvo models from the s80 onwards the most obvious styling feature being the stepped waistline which was inspired by the similar feature on the 200 series whilst retaining some of the angular elements from the 700 900 ranges the volvo ecc was built on the volvo p80 platform in contrast to most production hybrids which use a gasoline piston engine to provide additional acceleration and to recharge the battery storage the volvo ecc used a gas turbine engine to drive the generator for recharging this type of engine has a higher thermodynamic efficiency than the conventional internal combustion engine with pistons also in volvo s design the fuel is evaporated and mixed with air before ignition this provides a very low nox emission the driver can also switch between gas turbine electric and hybrid by switches on the dashboard the maximum power available was with 76 available for continuous use it

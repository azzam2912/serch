it is a useful reagent in chemical synthesis it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide dinitrogen tetroxide is a powerful oxidizer that is hypergolic spontaneously reacts upon contact with various forms of hydrazine which has made the pair a common bipropellant for rockets dinitrogen tetroxide could be regarded as two nitro groups no bonded together it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide the molecule is planar with an n n bond distance of 1 78 and n o distances of 1 19 the n n distance corresponds to a weak bond since it is significantly longer than the average n n single bond length of 1 45 unlike no no is diamagnetic since it has no unpaired electrons the liquid is also colorless but can appear as a brownish yellow liquid due to the presence of no according to the following equilibrium higher temperatures push the equilibrium towards nitrogen dioxide inevitably some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide nitrogen tetroxide is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia steam is used as a diluent to reduce the combustion temperature in the first step the ammonia is oxidized into nitric oxide most of the water

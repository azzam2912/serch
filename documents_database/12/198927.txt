while the focus of this article is mainly the languages and their features such a comparison will necessarily also consider some features of platforms and libraries for a more detailed comparison of the platforms please see comparison of the java and net platforms c and java are similar languages that are typed statically strongly and manifestly both are object oriented and designed with semi interpretation or runtime just in time compilation and both are curly brace languages like c and c both languages are statically typed with class based object orientation in java the primitive types are special in that they are not object oriented and they could not have been defined using the language itself they also do not share a common ancestor with reference types the java reference types all derive from a common root type c has a unified type system in which all types besides unsafe pointers ultimately derive from a common root type consequently all types implement the methods of this root type and extension methods defined for the object type apply to all types even primitive int literals and delegates this allows c unlike java to support objects with encapsulation that are not reference

they can act in groups up to a thousand to execute commands programmed by users that could not be executed by individual robots a large issue with research on robot collectives is that the cost of individual units is too high but the kilobot s total cost of parts is under 15 in addition to the low cost it still has applications such as collective transport human swarm interaction and shape self assembly during november 2010 michael rubenstein and radhika nagpal began the development of the kilobot with the support of the wyss institute for biologically inspired engineering and the national science foundation the two primary objectives of the kilobot s design were to keep the cost low while having enough functionality to perform an array of collective tasks one of the developer s goals was to allow the kilobot to run the program s dash s dash scalable distributed self assembly and self healing is an algorithm developed to self assemble and self heal a collective shape s dash requires these capabilities in order to increase the applications of the kilobot the following additional components were included the power source is a rechargeable lithium ion battery that can power

the study of organic geochemistry is traced to the work of alfred e treibs the father of organic geochemistry treibs first isolated metalloporphyrins from petroleum this discovery established the biological origin of petroleum which was previously poorly understood metalloporphyrins in general are highly stable organic compounds and the detailed structures of the extracted derivatives made clear that they originated from chlorophyll the relationship between the occurrence of organic compounds in sedimentary deposits and petroleum deposits has long been of interest studies of ancient sediments and rock provide insights into the origins and sources of oil and petroleum as well as the biochemical antecedents of life oil spills in particular have been of interest to geochemists in regards to the impact of petroleum and oil on the current geological environment following the exxon valdez oil spill organic geochemistry knowledge on oil spill chemistry bloomed with the analyses of samples from the spill geochemists study petroleum inclusions in geological samples to compare present day fluid inclusions to dated samples this analysis provides insight into the age of the petroleum samples and the surrounding rock spectrographic optical destructive and nondestructive methods are used to analyze samples via mass spectrometry or raman spectroscopy the

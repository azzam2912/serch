the main function of a separator is to keep the two electrodes apart to prevent electrical short circuits while also allowing the transport of ionic charge carriers that are needed to close the circuit during the passage of current in an electrochemical cell separators are critical components in liquid electrolyte batteries a separator generally consists of a polymeric membrane forming a microporous layer it must be chemically and electrochemically stable with regard to the electrolyte and electrode materials and mechanically strong enough to withstand the high tension during battery construction they are important to batteries because their structure and properties considerably affect the battery performance including the batteries energy and power densities cycle life and safety unlike many forms of technology polymer separators were not developed specifically for batteries they were instead spin offs of existing technologies which is why most are not optimized for the systems they are used in even though this may seem unfavorable most polymer separators can be mass produced at a low cost because they are based on existing forms of technologies yoshino and co workers of the asahi kasei corporation first developed them for a prototype of secondary lithium ion batteries libs in 1983

it provides the fundamental solution the most general solution to the orthonormal eigenfunctions of the operator are the hermite functions with corresponding eigenvalues 2 1 furnishing particular solutions the general solution is then a linear combination of these when fitted to the initial condition the general solution reduces to where the kernel has the separable representation utilizing mehler s formula then yields on substituting this in the expression for with the value exp 2 for mehler s kernel finally reads exp bigl coth 2t x 2 y 2 2 text cosech 2t xy bigr when 0 variables and coincide resulting in the limiting formula necessary by the initial condition as a fundamental solution the kernel is additive this is further related to the symplectic rotation structure of the kernel the result of mehler can also be linked to probability for this the variables should be rescaled as so as to change from the physicist s hermite polynomials with weight function exp to probabilist s hermite polynomials with weight function exp 2 then becomes the left hand side here is p x y p x p y where p x y is the bivariate gaussian probability density function for variables having

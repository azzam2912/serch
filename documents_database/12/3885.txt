heat engines like the internal combustion engine burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to do work electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind up toys use elastic energy in biological systems molecular motors like myosins in muscles use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion the word engine derives from old french engin from the latin ingenium the root of the word ingenious pre industrial weapons of war such as catapults trebuchets and battering rams were called siege engines and knowledge of how to construct them was often treated as a military secret the word gin as in cotton gin is short for engine most mechanical devices invented during the industrial revolution were described as engines the steam engine being a notable example however the original steam engines such as those by thomas savery were not mechanical engines but pumps in this manner a fire engine in its original form was merely a water pump with the engine being transported to the fire by horses in modern usage the term engine typically describes devices like steam engines and internal combustion engines that burn or

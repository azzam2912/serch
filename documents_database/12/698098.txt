informally a player playing by a strategy from a quasi perfect equilibrium takes observed as well as potential future mistakes of his opponents into account but assumes that he himself will not make a mistake in the future even if he observes that he has done so in the past quasi perfect equilibrium is a further refinement of sequential equilibrium it is itself refined by normal form proper equilibrium it has been argued by jean fran ois mertens that quasi perfect equilibrium is superior to reinhard selten s notion of extensive form trembling hand perfect equilibrium as a quasi perfect equilibrium is guaranteed to describe admissible behavior in contrast for a certain two player voting game no extensive form trembling hand perfect equilibrium describes admissible behavior for both players the voting game suggested by mertens may be described as follows in the unique quasi perfect equilibrium for the game each player votes for himself and if elected performs the task correctly this is also the unique admissible behavior but in any extensive form trembling hand perfect equilibrium at least one of the players believes that he is at least as likely as the other player to tremble and perform the

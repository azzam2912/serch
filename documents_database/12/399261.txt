the structure is found in living and extinct groups of animals including bats birds some dromaeosaurs pterosaurs gliding mammals some flying lizards and flying frogs the patagium that stretches between an animal s hind limbs is called the uropatagium especially in bats or the interfemoral membrane in bats the skin forming the surface of the wing is an extension of the skin of the abdomen that runs to the tip of each digit uniting the forelimb with the body the patagium of a bat has four distinct parts in the flying pterosaurs the patagium was composed of the membrane forming the surface of the wing supported primarily between the body and the elongated fourth finger the patagium of a pterosaur had three distinct parts flying squirrels sugar gliders colugos anomalures and other mammals also have patagia that extends between the limbs as in bats and pterosaurs they also possess propatagia and uropatagia though the forelimb is not as specialised as in true flyers the membrane tends to be an equally complex organ composed of various muscle groups and fibers various species have styliform bones to support the membranes either on the elbow colugos anomalures greater glider eomys or on the

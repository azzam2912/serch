many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to adversely affect it however when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the sensory threshold they replace or obscure the flavors and aromas that the wine should be expressing or that the winemaker wants the wine to express ultimately the quality of the wine is reduced making it less appealing and sometimes undrinkable the yeast brettanomyces produces an array of metabolites when growing in wine some of which are volatile phenolic compounds brettanomyces converts p coumaric acid to 4 vinylphenol via the enzyme cinnamate decarboxylase 4 vinylphenol is further reduced to 4 ethylphenol by the enzyme vinyl phenol reductase 4 ethylphenol causes a wine fault at a concentration of greater than 140 g l other compounds produced by brettanomyces that cause wine faults include 4 ethylguaiacol and isovaleric acid coumaric acid is sometimes added to microbiological media enabling the positive identification of brettanomyces by smell geraniol is a by product of the metabolism of sorbate fusel alcohols are a mixture of several alcohols chiefly amyl alcohol produced as a by product of alcoholic fermentation

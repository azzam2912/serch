trichogramma is one of around 80 genera from the family trichogrammatidae with over 200 species worldwide although several groups of egg parasitoids are commonly employed for biological control throughout the world trichogramma spp have been the most extensively studied more than a thousand papers have been published on trichogramma species and they are the most used biological control agents in the world trichogramma spp have less than 10 000 neurons approaching the size limit of how small an insect can be determined by how few neurons they can fit in their central nervous systems yet exhibiting a complex behavior to sustain their lives to locate host eggs adult females use chemical and visual signals such as egg shape and colour after she finds a suitable egg an experienced female attempts to determine if the egg has previously been parasitized using her ovipositor and antennal drumming tapping on the egg surface females also use antennal drumming to determine the size and quality of the target egg which determines the number of eggs the female will insert a single female can parasitize up to 10 host eggs a day trichogramma wasps are small and very uniform in structure which causes difficulty in

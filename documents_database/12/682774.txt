bell began researching the concept in the mid 1960s as a way to provide high performance computing support for the needs of anti ballistic missile abm systems the goal was to build a computer system that could simultaneously track hundreds of incoming ballistic missile warheads a single pepe system was built by burroughs corporation in the 1970s by which time the us army s abm efforts were winding down the design later evolved into the burroughs scientific computer for commercial sales but a lack of sales prospects led to it being withdrawn from the market pepe came about as a result of predictions of the sorts of icbm forces that would be expected in the event of an all out soviet attack during the 1970s missile fleets of both the us and ussr were growing through the 1960s but a bigger issue was the number of warheads as a result of the move to multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles mirv computers designed for the nike x system were largely similar to systems like the ibm 7030 and would have been able to handle attacks with perhaps a dozen warheads arriving simultaneously with mirv hundreds of targets both warheads and decoys

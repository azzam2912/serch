since the spectrum of the laplace beltrami operator is invariant under isometries it is well suited for the analysis or retrieval of non rigid shapes i e bendable objects such as humans animals plants etc the laplace beltrami operator is involved in many important differential equations such as the heat equation and the wave equation it can be defined on a riemannian manifold as the divergence of the gradient of a real valued function f its spectral components can be computed by solving the helmholtz equation or laplacian eigenvalue problem the solutions are the eigenfunctions formula 3 modes and corresponding eigenvalues formula 4 representing a diverging sequence of positive real numbers the first eigenvalue is zero for closed domains or when using the neumann boundary condition for some shapes the spectrum can be computed analytically e g rectangle flat torus cylinder disk or sphere for the sphere for example the eigenfunctions are the spherical harmonics the most important properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are that they are isometry invariants in other words if the shape is not stretched e g a sheet of paper bent into the third dimension the spectral values will not change bendable objects like animals

mice and rats although spect is a well established imaging technique that is already for decades in use for clinical application the limited resolution of clinical spect 10 mm stimulated the development of dedicated small animal spect systems with sub mm resolution unlike in clinics preclinical spect outperforms preclinical coincidence pet in terms of resolution best spatial resolution of spect 0 25mm pet 1 mm and at the same time allows to perform fast dynamic imaging of animals less than 15s time frames spect imaging requires administration of small quantities of emitting radiolabeled molecules commonly called tracers into the animal prior to the image acquisition these tracers are biochemically designed in such a way that they accumulate at target locations in the body the radiation emitted by the tracer molecules single photons can be detected by gamma detectors and after image reconstruction results in a 3 dimensional image of the tracer distribution within the animal some key radioactive isotopes used in preclinical spect are tc i i i in ga and tl preclinical spect plays an important role in multiple areas of translational research where spect can be used for non invasive imaging of radiolabeled molecules including antibodies peptides and

the concept is useful because a sailboat cannot sail directly upwind and thus often can not or should not sail directly to a mark to reach it as quickly as possible it is also often less than optimal to sail directly downwind instead of sailing directly toward a windward mark the helmsman chooses a point of sail towards the direction of the wind that optimizes velocity made good either towards the destination or towards better winds to actually reach a mark the boat needs to alternate between courses tacks where the wind approaches from alternating sides the helmsman uses vmg to find exactly what the optimum angle against the wind is at optimum vmg steering closer to the direction of the wind will reduce boat speed while steering further away from the direction of the wind might give a higher boat speed but at the cost of a larger deviation in heading so less progress towards a mark for reaching marks that are towards the direction of the wind sailboats need to alternate between headings tacks where the wind angle towards the wind is on opposite sides of the boat on a tack the sailor might start by pointing the

generally new modes can be tested in the amateur radio service although national regulations may require disclosure of a new mode to permit radio licensing authorities to monitor the transmissions encryption for example is not generally permitted in the amateur radio service except for the special purpose of satellite vehicle control uplinks the following is a partial list of the modes of communication used where the mode includes both modulation types and operating protocols morse code is called the original digital mode radio telegraphy designed for machine to machine communication is the direct on off keying of a continuous wave carrier by morse code symbols often called amplitude shift keying or ask may be considered to be an amplitude modulated mode of communications and is rightfully considered the first digital data mode although more than 140 years old bandwidth efficient morse code originally developed by samuel morse and alfred vail in the 1840s uses techniques that were not more fully understood until much later under the modern rubrics of source coding or data compression the bandwidth efficiency of morse code arises because the most used source symbols were accorded the shortest morse code symbols and the least used were accorded

they usually link the plasma membrane to the protein and carbohydrate that composed the cell wall the receptor like proteins contain a cytoplasmic serine threonine kinase and a less conserved region bound to the cell wall and contains a series of epidermal growth factor repeats waks are found in various plants and crops like rice and maize in plants genome like arabidopsis waks are encoded by five highly similar genes clustered in a 30 kb locus among them wak1 wak2 are highly distributed they are primarily involved in regulating plant cell wall functions including cell expansion bind as well as response to pectins pathogen response and also protects plants from detrimental effects all the five wak proteins have highly conserved serine threonine protein kinase domain 86 similarity on the cytoplasmic side and an extracellular domain only 40 to 64 similarity in amino acid sequences moreover all of the isomers of wak proteins have epidermal growth factor egf like repeats located at the amino terminal side six cysteins located in the egf repeats positions are well kept in all the five waks however protein protein interactions of waks are still unknown all waks waks 1 5 have asp asn hydroxylation site

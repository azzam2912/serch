the technique was developed from the observations of pale wisps seen moving on radar during the second world war these were termed as angels ghosts or phantoms in britain and were later identified as being caused by migrating birds over time the technology has been vastly improved with doppler weather radars that allow the detection of birds bats as well as insects with resolution and sensitivity that is sufficient to quantify the speed of flaps that can sometimes aid in the identification of species according to david lack the earliest recorded use of radar in detecting birds came in 1940 the movements of gulls herons and lapwings that caused some of the detentions was visually confirmed it was however only in the 1950s through the work of ernst sutter at zurich airport that more elusive angels were confirmed to be caused by small passerines david lack was one of the pioneers of radar ornithology in england early radar ornithology mainly focused due to limitations of the equipment on the seasonality timing intensity and direction of flocks of birds in migration modern weather radars can detect the wing area of the flying the speed of flight the frequency of wing beat

it is a digital signature scheme known for its simplicity among the first whose security is based on the intractability of certain discrete logarithm problems it is efficient and generates short signatures it was covered by which expired in february 2008 in the following to sign a message formula 15 the signature is the pair formula 22 note that formula 23 if formula 24 then the signature representation can fit into 40 bytes if formula 27 then the signature is verified it is relatively easy to see that formula 27 if the signed message equals the verified message formula 29 and hence formula 30 public elements formula 1 formula 3 formula 2 formula 34 formula 35 formula 36 formula 20 private elements formula 16 formula 13 this shows only that a correctly signed message will verify correctly many other properties are required for a secure signature algorithm just as with the closely related signature algorithms dsa ecdsa and elgamal reusing the secret nonce value formula 16 on two schnorr signatures of different messages will allow observers to recover the private key in the case of schnorr signatures this simply requires subtracting formula 35 values if formula 43 but formula 44

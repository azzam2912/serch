it is a salt with caesium cations and bh anions this anion has been of great theoretical interest to the chemistry community the bh anion s b core is a regular icosahedron the bh as a whole also has icosahedral molecular symmetry and it belongs to the molecular point group i its icosahedral shape is consistent with the classification of this cage as closo in polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory crystals of csbh feature cs ions in contact with twelve hydrides provided by four bh the b b bond distances are 178 pm and the b h distances are 112 pm many other salts are known the dodecaborate anion was first prepared in modest yield by pitochelli and hawthorne from iododecarborane it is more conventienly prepared in two steps from sodium borohydride first the borohydride is converted into a triborate anion using the etherate of boron trifluoride pyrolysis of the triborate gives the twelve boron cluster as the sodium salt which is then treated with caesium hydroxide to precipitate csbh salts of bh have been investigated for boron neutron capture therapy and as fuels for airbags salts of bh are precursors to related derivatives including b oh and b ch

the multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence of numbers starting from that prime with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime this is the sieve s key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime the earliest known reference to the sieve k skinon eratosth nous is in nicomachus of gerasa s introduction to arithmetic which describes it and attributes it to eratosthenes of cyrene a greek mathematician one of a number of prime number sieves it is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes it may be used to find primes in arithmetic progressions a prime number is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors 1 and itself to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer by eratosthenes method the main idea here is that every value given to will be prime because if it were composite it would be marked as a multiple of some other smaller prime note that some of the numbers may be marked more than once e g 15 will be marked both

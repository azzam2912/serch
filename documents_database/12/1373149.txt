the impacts stem from the altered hydrological conditions caused by the installation and operation of the irrigation scheme an irrigation scheme draws water from groundwater rivers lakes or overland flow and distributes it over an area hydrological or direct effects of doing this include reduction in downstream river flow increased evaporation in the irrigated area increased level in the water table as groundwater recharge in the area is increased and flow increased in the irrigated area likewise irrigation has immediate effects on the provision of moisture to the atmosphere inducing atmospheric instabilities and increasing downwind rainfall or in other cases modifies the atmospheric circulation delivering rain to different downwind areas increases or decreases in irrigation are a key area of concern in precipitationshed studies that examine how significant modifications to the delivery of evaporation to the atmosphere can alter downwind rainfall indirect effects are those that have consequences that take longer to develop and may also be longer lasting the indirect effects of irrigation include the following the indirect effects of waterlogging and soil salination occur directly on the land being irrigated the ecological and socioeconomic consequences take longer to happen but can be more far reaching some irrigation schemes

rems measures humidity pressure temperature wind speeds and ultraviolet radiation on mars this spanish project is led by the spanish astrobiology center and includes the finnish meteorological institute as a partner contributing pressure and humidity sensors all sensors are located around three elements two booms attached to the rover remote sensing mast rsm the ultraviolet sensor uvs assembly located on the rover top deck and the instrument control unit icu inside the rover goals include understanding martian general circulation microscale weather systems local hydrological cycle destructive potential of uv radiation and subsurface habitability based on ground atmosphere interaction by august 18 2012 rems was turned on and its data was being returned to earth the temperature at that time 37 degrees fahrenheit 2 8 degrees celsius on august 21 2012 one of two windspeedmeters returned data with errors after testing it was concluded that it was broken probably hit by a rock on descent martian winds can still be detected with the other sensor reports are posted on the center for astrobiology website and twitter daily parts of rems the pressure sensor can detect pressures from 1 to 1150 pa pascal 0 000145038 psi to 0 1667934 psi for comparison

the species is a flagellate and can resemble a plant at one stage of its life in which it carries a photosynthesizing alga inside itself or an animal acting as predator in another stage of its life researchers believe that this organism is in the process of secondary endosymbiosis in which one organism is incorporated into another resulting in a completely new life form h arenicola was first noticed as algal bloom in 2000 from isonoura beach in japan it was found in the area of moderately sheltered sandy shore where a number of algae surfaced during tsunami the specimens were present in the upper edge of the seepage face it can be found throughout the year except in winter it was originally believed to be a new green alga however it was discovered that the chlorophyll bearing plastids were independent of the cell division indicating that they were separate but temporary endosymbiotic organisms h arenicola is a protist with one rounded cell having two flagella for locomotion it feeds on algae using a complex feeding tube when it leads an independent life the feeding tube however is replaced by an endosymbiotic alga the algal endosymbiont is a green alga

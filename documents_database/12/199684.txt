this is why it is first shown how the translation operator is acting on a particle at position x the particle is then in the state formula 9 according to quantum mechanics translation of the particle at position x to position x a formula 10 because a translation of 0 does not change the position of the particle we have with 1 meaning the identity operator which does nothing taylor development gives with from that follows this is a differential equation with the solution formula 18 additionally suppose a hamiltonian formula 19 is independent of the formula 20 position because the translation operator can be written in terms of formula 21 and formula 22 we know that formula 23 this result means that linear momentum for the system is conserved classically we have for the angular momentum formula 24 this is the same in quantum mechanics considering formula 25 and formula 26 as operators classically an infinitesimal rotation formula 27 of the vector r x y z about the z axis to r x y z leaving z unchanged can be expressed by the following infinitesimal translations using taylor approximation from that follows for states and consequently using formula 36

in theory this approach would dramatically reduce the amount of memory bandwidth required for 3d games and thereby lead to lower cost graphics accelerators the project took place during the introduction of the first high performance 3d accelerators and these quickly surpassed talisman in both performance and price no talisman based systems were ever released commercially and the project was eventually cancelled in the late 1990s creating a 3d image for display consists of a series of steps first the objects to be displayed are loaded up into memory from individual models the display system then applies mathematical functions to transform the models into a common coordinate system the world view from this world view a series of polygons typically triangles is created that approximates the original models as seen from a particular viewpoint the camera next a compositing system produces an image by rendering the triangles and applying textures to the outside textures are small images that are painted onto the triangles to produce realism the resulting image is then combined with various special effects and moved into the display buffers this basic conceptual layout is known as the display pipeline in general terms the display changes little from

this approach in which observable properties of a macroscopic system are influenced by direct alteration of a molecular structure falls into the broader category of bottom up design molecular engineering is highly interdisciplinary by nature encompassing aspects of chemical engineering materials science bioengineering electrical engineering physics mechanical engineering and chemistry there is also considerable overlap with nanotechnology in that both are concerned with the behavior of materials on the scale of nanometers or smaller given the highly fundamental nature of molecular interactions there are a plethora of potential application areas limited perhaps only by one s imagination and the laws of physics however some of the early successes of molecular engineering have come in the fields of immunotherapy synthetic biology and printable electronics see molecular engineering applications molecular engineering is a dynamic and evolving field with complex target problems breakthroughs require sophisticated and creative engineers who are conversant across disciplines a rational engineering methodology that is based on molecular principles is in contrast to the widespread trial and error approaches common throughout engineering disciplines rather than relying on well described but poorly understood empirical correlations between the makeup of a system and its properties a molecular design approach seeks to

it is an important precursor used in the preparation of other platinum compounds it exists in two crystalline forms but the main properties are somewhat similar dark brown insoluble in water diamagnetic and odorless the structures of ptcl and pdcl are similar these dichlorides exist in both polymeric or and hexameric or structures the form converts to the form at 500 c in the form the pt pt distances are 3 32 3 40 indicative of some bonding between the pairs of metals in both forms of ptcl each pt center is four coordinate being surrounded by four chloride ligands complementarily each cl center is two coordinate being connected to two platinum atoms ptcl is prepared by heating chloroplatinic acid to 350 c in air this method is convenient since the chloroplatinic acid is generated readily from pt metal aqueous solutions of hptcl can also be reduced with hydrazinium salts but this method is more laborious than the thermal route of kerr and schweizer although ptcl must form when platinum metal contacts hot chlorine gas this process suffers from over chlorination to give ptcl berzelius and later w hler and streicher showed that upon heating to 450 c this pt

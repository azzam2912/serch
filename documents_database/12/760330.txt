the song is the eighth track on the band s third studio album vitalogy 1994 although credited to all members of pearl jam it was primarily written by vocalist eddie vedder despite the lack of a commercial single release the song managed to reach number 13 on the billboard modern rock tracks chart the song was included on pearl jam s 2004 greatest hits album rearviewmirror greatest hits 1991 2003 corduroy begins with an eerie guitar riff played as an arpeggio of the first two notes of a power chord then the song lifts off proceeding with a structure of verse chorus verse chorus bridge chorus verse although not revolutionary the song structure is not completely normal as almost no lyrics are repeated including choruses and the fade out of the song begins after a verse rather than the traditional ending of a song after the third chorus the lyrical content for corduroy can be interpreted in many ways but one common theory is that they are about the pressures of fame in an interview vocalist eddie vedder stated it is about a relationship but not between two people it s more one person s relationship with a million people

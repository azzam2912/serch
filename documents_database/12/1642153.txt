at the same time when conducting research under microgravity conditions basic functions of the human body are examined by eliminating the interfering influence of gravity in a system physiological approach in the field of psychology the selection of qualified personnel pilots astronauts air traffic controllers and the development of suitable scientific instruments for the selection procedure are another main task of the institute finally we also deal with the problem of adaptation of life to extreme environments and take part in projects that are concerned with the search for life in space medical operations is an interdisciplinary field covering aviation space and travel medicine work carried out here includes the study of the physical physiological psychological ergonomic and medical characteristics of air and space travel the department is also responsible for the health and well being of flight personnel and passengers and regularly carries out medical examinations on those groups this division integrates all activities in me that provide support for me internal as well as for external scientists in the field of gravity relevant applications in the biomedical sciences the profile reaches from scientific and administrational support when planning experiments in microgravity over concrete experiment preparation and operational support

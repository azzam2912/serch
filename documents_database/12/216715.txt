they undergo a radical metamorphosis with the larval and adult stages differing considerably in their structure and behaviour this is called holometabolism or complete metamorphism the endopterygota are among the most diverse insect superorders with over 1 million living species divided between 11 orders containing insects such as butterflies flies fleas bees ants and beetles they are distinguished from the exopterygota or hemipterodea by the way in which their wings develop endopterygota meaning literally internal winged forms develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage exopterygota external winged forms develop wings on the outside their bodies and do not go through a pupal stage the latter trait is plesiomorphic however and not exclusively found in the exopterygotes but also in groups such as odonata dragonflies and damselflies which are not neoptera but more basal among insects the earliest endopterygote fossils date from the carboniferous the endopterygota are sometimes divided into three assemblages neuropterida neuroptera megaloptera raphidioptera strepsiptera and coleoptera hymenopteroida hymenoptera and panorpida siphonaptera diptera trichoptera lepidoptera and mecoptera the hymenopterans with their highly developed social systems were believed to have constituted the most advanced insects despite their rather primitive anatomy compared to flies

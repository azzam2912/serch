in essence a representation makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete by describing its elements by matrices and the algebraic operations in terms of matrix addition and matrix multiplication the theory of matrices and linear operators is well understood so representations of more abstract objects in terms of familiar linear algebra objects helps glean properties and sometimes simplify calculations on more abstract theories the algebraic objects amenable to such a description include groups associative algebras and lie algebras the most prominent of these and historically the first is the representation theory of groups in which elements of a group are represented by invertible matrices in such a way that the group operation is matrix multiplication representation theory is a useful method because it reduces problems in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra a subject that is well understood furthermore the vector space on which a group for example is represented can be infinite dimensional and by allowing it to be for instance a hilbert space methods of analysis can be applied to the theory of groups representation theory is also important in physics because for example it describes how the symmetry group of a physical system affects the solutions

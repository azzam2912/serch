it is a sophisticated theory at the level of jet spaces and employing algebraic methods secondary calculus acts on the space of solutions of a system of partial differential equations usually non linear equations when the number of independent variables is zero i e the equations are algebraic ones secondary calculus reduces to classical differential calculus all objects in secondary calculus are cohomology classes of differential complexes growing on diffieties the latter are in the framework of secondary calculus the analog of smooth manifolds cohomological physics was born with gauss s theorem describing the electric charge contained inside a given surface in terms of the flux of the electric field through the surface itself flux is the integral of a differential form and consequently a de rham cohomology class it is not by chance that formulas of this kind such as the well known stokes formula though being a natural part of classical differential calculus have entered in modern mathematics from physics all the constructions in classical differential calculus have an analog in secondary calculus for instance higher symmetries of a system of partial differential equations are the analog of vector fields on differentiable manifolds the euler operator which associates

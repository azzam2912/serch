now rare in four stroke engines total loss oiling is still used in many two stroke engines steam engines used many separate oil boxes dotted around the engine each one was filled before starting and often refilled during running where access was difficult usually because the oil box was on a moving component the oil box had to be large enough to contain enough oil for a long working shift to control the flow rate of oil from the reservoir to the bearing the oil would flow through an oil wick by capillary action rather than downwards under gravity on steamships that ran their engines for days at a time some crew members would be oilers whose primary duty was to continuously monitor and maintain oil boxes on steam locomotives access would be impossible during running so in some cases centralised mechanical lubricators were used these devices comprised a large oil tank with a multiple outlet pump which fed the engine s bearings through a pipe system lubrication of the engine s internal valves was done by adding oil to the steam supply using a displacement lubricator the first recirculating systems used a collection sump but no pumped circulation merely

it is also known as lov sz theta function and is commonly denoted by g this quantity was first introduced by l szl lov sz in his 1979 paper on the shannon capacity of a graph accurate numerical approximations to this number can be computed in polynomial time by semidefinite programming and the ellipsoid method it is sandwiched between the chromatic number and clique number of any graph and can be used to compute these numbers on graphs for which they are equal including perfect graphs let g v e be a graph on n vertices an ordered set of n unit vectors u u i v r is called an orthonormal representation of g in r if u and u are orthogonal whenever vertices i and j are not adjacent in g clearly every graph admits an orthonormal representation with n n just represent vertices by distinct vectors from the standard basis of r though this will not in general be faithful unless the graph is edgeless a faithful representation in n n is also possible by associating each vertex to a basis vector as before but mapping each vertex to the sum of basis vectors associated with its

the combined apparent visual magnitude of 4 69 is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye the distance to hd 34968 can be estimated from its annual parallax shift of yielding a range of 374 light years it is moving further away from the earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of 31 km s having come within some 3 686 000 years ago the primary member component a is a magnitude 4 73 star houk and smith moore 1978 gave this object a stellar classification of a0 v indicating it is an ordinary a type main sequence star gray and garrison 1987 classified it as b9 5 iii and noted that the spectrum is slightly variable it is of the way through its main sequence lifetime with 3 34 times the mass of the sun and 2 0 times the sun s radius the star is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 84 km s it is radiating 245 times the sun s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 10 046 the fainter secondary component b is a magnitude 8 45 star at an angular separation of along a position angle of 279 as

it uses the principle of the heating of a gas in this case air by rapid and adiabatic compression to ignite a piece of tinder which is then used to set light to kindling a fire piston consists of a hollow cylinder sealed at one end and open at the other sizes range in length from 3 to 6 inches 7 5 to 15 cm with a bore about 0 25 inch 6 7 mm in diameter to 10 to 14 inches 25 to 35 cm with a bore about 0 5 inch 14 mm in diameter a piston with an airtight circular seal is fitted into the cylinder string packing rubber gaskets or grease are used to create an air tight but slippery seal at the end of the piston is a small cavity where tinder can be attached without it being crushed during subsequent operations the piston can be completely withdrawn from the cylinder for installation or removal of the tinder the piston or cylinder has a handle on the end to allow a firm grip to be applied to it or a large enough surface area to strike it sharply without causing pain while the cylinder or

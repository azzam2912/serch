that is it concerns two dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable conventionally the x and y coordinates in a cartesian coordinate system and finds a linear function a non vertical straight line that as accurately as possible predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables the adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome variable is related to a single predictor it is common to make the additional stipulation that the ordinary least squares ols method should be used the accuracy of each predicted value is measured by its squared residual vertical distance between the point of the data set and the fitted line and the goal is to make the sum of these squared deviations as small as possible other regression methods that can be used in place of ordinary least squares include least absolute deviations minimizing the sum of absolute values of residuals and the theil sen estimator which chooses a line whose slope is the median of the slopes determined by pairs of sample points deming regression total least squares also finds a line that fits a set of two dimensional sample points but unlike ordinary least

fsp produces metal oxide powders from highly volatile gaseous metal chlorides that are decomposed oxidized in hydrogen oxygen flames to form nano oxide powders however products made from fsp s vapor phase process are limited to al ti zr and si based oxides from their metal chlorides thus interest in producing more complex materials required a new methodology lf fsp lf fsp as invented at the university of michigan uses metalloorganic precursors such as metal carboxylates or alkoxides not metal chlorides briefly alcohol typically ethanol solutions containing 1 10 wt loading of the target ceramic components as precursors are aerosolized with o into a quartz chamber and ignited with methane pilot torches initial combustion temperatures run 1500 2000 c depending on the processing conditions generating nanopowder soot temperatures drop to 300 500 c over 1 5 m equivalent to a 1000 c quench in 100 ms leading to kinetic products and nanopowders that are unaggregated production rates can be 200 g h when using wire in tube electrostatic precipitators operating at 10 kv typical powders have 15 100 nm average particle sizes aps with specific surface areas of 30 100 m g lf fsp technology can be used to produce

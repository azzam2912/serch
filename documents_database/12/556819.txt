the object of hive is to capture the opponent s queen bee by completely surrounding it while avoiding the capture of one s own queen hive is an abstract strategy game hive shares elements of both tile based games and board games it differs from other tile based games in that the tiles once placed can then be moved to other positions according to various rules much like chess pieces thus the game has mechanics comparable to an abstract strategy board game and is marketed in that genre it does not fit the classical definition however as there is no gameboard involved the pieces are simply placed on some relatively flat surface the game uses hexagonal tiles to represent the various contents of the hive the original two editions used wooden tiles with full color illustrations on blue and silver stickers to represent the units but the current third edition has been published using black and almond phenolic resin bakelite tiles with single color painted etchings there are 22 pieces in total making up a hive set with 11 pieces per player each representing a creature and a different means of moving the colors listed are for the third edition

pulsars are rapidly rotating highly magnetized neutron stars formed during the supernova explosions of massive stars they act as highly accurate clocks with a wealth of physical applications ranging from celestial mechanics neutron star seismology tests of strong field gravity and galactic astronomy the idea to use pulsars as gravitational wave detectors was originally proposed by sazhin and detweiler in the late 1970s the idea is to treat the solar system barycenter and a distant pulsar as opposite ends of an imaginary arm in space the pulsar acts as the reference clock at one end of the arm sending out regular signals which are monitored by an observer on the earth the effect of a passing gravitational wave would be to perturb the local space time metric and cause a change in the observed rotational frequency of the pulsar hellings and downs subsequently extended this idea to an array of pulsars and found that a stochastic background of gravitational waves would produce a correlated signal for different angular separations on the sky this work was limited in sensitivity by the precision and stability of the pulsar clocks in the array following the discovery of the first millisecond pulsar in 1982

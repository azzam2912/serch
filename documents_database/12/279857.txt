in general a pressure is a force per unit area across a surface a difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force which can result in an acceleration according to newton s second law of motion if there is no additional force to balance it the resulting force is always directed from the region of higher pressure to the region of lower pressure when a fluid is in an equilibrium state i e there are no net forces and no acceleration the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium in the case of atmospheres the pressure gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium in earth s atmosphere for example air pressure decreases at altitudes above earth s surface thus providing a pressure gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere consider a cubic parcel of fluid with a density formula 1 a height formula 2 and a surface area formula 3 the mass of the parcel can be expressed as formula 4 using newton s second law formula 5 we can then examine a pressure difference formula 6 assumed to be only in the formula 7 direction

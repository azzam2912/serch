the album was recorded in 1976 but not released until 1989 in 1975 yezda urfa made a demo ep boris but since no interest was generated by it they decided to go for a second album that would be released on their own label with the hope that after it generated enough interest it would attract the attention of a record company yezda urfa funded the project themselves and just before finishing they almost had a deal with a small label in chicago but the deal fell through after completing the recording but short of cash they abandoned the idea of releasing the album and shelved the master tape some time later the band was discovered by syn phonic and the album was released in 1989 this album was recorded in about two weeks in two different studios they had started using the same studio as for the boris album but switched to another more modern studio shortly after they started recording in the time that had elapsed since recording boris their music had evolved some of the material that appeared on boris was reworked for this album produced recorded at universal studios chicago and hedden west recorders schaumburg illinois

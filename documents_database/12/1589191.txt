its uplift in the late cretaceous marked the formation of the wealden anticline the rock strata contain hydrocarbon deposits which have yielded coal oil and gas the weald basin s formation commenced during the carboniferous with the rocks which are today basement deposited within a low swamp providing coals which were exploited to the north and east in kent but boreholes drilled in the 19th century failed to find this deposit in the area of the weald the carboniferous coals may be overlain by early triassic sediments the sediments were uplifted and faulted within the variscan orogeny with the land now occupied by the weald basin being a low external fold belt to the main orogeny which was located within the present day english channel the remnants of the mountain belt can be seen today in devon and cornwall in what is known as the cornubian massif unlike in devon and cornwall the deformation caused little or no metamorphism the mountain belt collapsed soon after the orogeny leading to the former northward thrusts to be reactivated as normal faults and led to the formation of the weald basin which developed as an extension of the considerably larger wessex basin reconstructions

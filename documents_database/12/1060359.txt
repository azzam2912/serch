there are three receptors of the gamma aminobutyric acid the two receptors gaba and gaba are ion channels that are permeable to chloride ions which reduces neuronal excitability the gaba receptor belongs to the class of g protein coupled receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase therefore leading to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp gaba and gaba receptors produce sedative and hypnotic effects and have anti convulsion properties gaba receptors also produce sedative effects furthermore they lead to changes in gene transcription eszopiclone many commonly used sedative and anxiolytic drugs that affect the gaba receptor complex aren t agonists these drugs are known as positive allosteric modulators pams and while they do bind to the gaba receptors they cannot induce a response from the neuron without an actual agonist being present drugs that fall into this class exert their pharmacodynamic action by increasing the effects that an agonist has when potentiation is achieved most general anaesthetics are pams of gaba a receptor positive allosteric modulators work by increasing the frequency with which the chloride channel opens when an agonist binds to its own site on the gaba receptor the resulting increase in the concentration of cl ions in the postsynaptic neuron immediately

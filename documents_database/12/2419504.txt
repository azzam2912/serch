a channel system is similar to a pushdown automaton where a queue is used instead of a stack those queues are called channels intuitively each channel represents a sequence a message to be sent and to be read in the order in which they are sent formally a channel system or perfect channel system formula 1 is defined as a tuple formula 2 with depending of the author a channel system may have no initial state and may have an empty alphabet a configuration or global state of the channel system is a formula 11 tuple belonging to formula 12 intuitively a configuration formula 13 represents that a run is in state formula 14 and that its formula 15 th channel contains the word formula 16 the initial configuration is formula 17 with formula 18 the empty word intuitively a transition formula 19 means that the system may goes to control state formula 14 to formula 21 by writing an formula 22 to the end of the channel formula 23 similarly formula 24 means that the system may goes to control state formula 14 to formula 21 by removing a formula 22 starting the word formula 23 formally given a

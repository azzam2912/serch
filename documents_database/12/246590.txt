the el toro is quite small approximately 8 feet 2 44 long and very simple to sail the el toro was designed to serve as both a racing dinghy and a tender for ferrying people and material to and from a larger yacht the hull measures only long and at its widest point the design features a thwart or bench provided for use when rowing the available space for the sailor is smaller still as the sailor usually sits on the deck in the area behind the thwart with a characteristic snub nosed bow and high sides the el toro design is a sharp contrast to the low profile more sleek design of the laser or many other newer boats however the stability of the el toro makes it ideal for teaching sailing many junior sailing programs use the el toro to introduce new sailors to racing as the boat is easier for the young or inexperienced to control lasers and other similar boats generally require a larger person and quick reactions to keep the boat under control in brisk winds while the boat is often used by children and junior sailors and many adults complain of the small space

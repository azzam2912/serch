that is it introduces a new ring module out of an existing one so that it consists of fractions formula 1 such that the denominator s belongs to a given subset s of r if s is the set of the non zero elements of an integral domain then the localization is the field of fractions this case generalizes the construction of the ring q of rational numbers from the ring z of rational integers the technique has become fundamental particularly in algebraic geometry as it provides a natural link to sheaf theory in fact the term localization originates in algebraic geometry if r is a ring of functions defined on some geometric object algebraic variety v and one wants to study this variety locally near a point p then one considers the set s of all functions which are not zero at p and localizes r with respect to s the resulting ring r contains only information about the behavior of v near p c f the example given at local ring an important related process is completion one often localizes a ring module then completes the set s is assumed to be a submonoid of the multiplicative monoid

the issue of rank reversals lies at the heart of many debates in decision making and multi criteria decision making in particular unlike most other computational procedures it is hard to tell if a particular decision making method has derived the correct answer or not such methods analyze a set of alternatives described in terms of some criteria they determine which alternative is the best one or they provide relative weights of how the alternatives perform or just how the alternatives should be ranked when all the criteria are considered simultaneously this is exactly where the challenge with decision making exists often it is hard if not practically impossible to determine whether a correct answer has been reached or not with other computational methods for instance with a job scheduling method one can examine a set of different answers and then categorize the answers according to some metric of performance for instance a project s completion time but this may not be possible to do with the answers derived by most decision making methods after all determining the best decision making method leads to a decision making paradox thus the following question emerges how can one evaluate decision making methods

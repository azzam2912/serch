the island is accessible from the mainland at low tide by means of a causeway the castle is located in what was once the very volatile border area between england and scotland not only did the english and scots fight but the area was frequently attacked by vikings the castle was built in 1550 around the time that lindisfarne priory went out of use and stones from the priory were used as building material it is very small by the usual standards and was more of a fort the castle sits on the highest point of the island a whinstone hill called beblowe lindisfarne s position in the north sea made it vulnerable to attack from scots and norsemen and by tudor times it was clear there was a need for a stronger fortification although by this time the norsemen were no longer a danger this resulted in the creation of the fort on beblowe crag between 1570 and 1572 which forms the basis of the present castle after henry viii suppressed the priory his troops used the remains as a naval store in 1542 henry viii ordered the earl of rutland to fortify the site against possible scottish invasion

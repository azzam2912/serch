its circulations generally do not extend below in altitude as it is an example of a cold core low a weak inverted wave in the easterlies is generally found beneath it and it may also be associated with broad areas of high level clouds downward development results in an increase of cumulus clouds and the appearance of circulation at ground level in rare cases a warm core cyclone can develop in its associated convective activity resulting in a tropical cyclone and a weakening and southwest movement of the nearby upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex symbiotic relationships can exist between tropical cyclones and the upper level lows in their wake with the two systems occasionally leading to their mutual strengthening when they move over land during the warm season an increase in monsoon rains occurs using charts of mean 200 hectopascal circulation for july through august located above sea level to locate the circumpolar troughs and ridges trough lines extend over the eastern and central north pacific and over the north atlantic case studies of upper tropospheric cyclones in the atlantic and pacific have been performed by using airplane reports winds temperatures and heights radiosonde data geostationary satellite cloud imagery and cloud

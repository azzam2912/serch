these include neural network models and their integration with gene network models this area brings together knowledge from various scientific disciplines such as computer and information science neuroscience and cognitive science genetics and molecular biology as well as engineering models of the kinetics of proteins and ion channels associated with neuron activity represent the lowest level of modeling in a computational neurogenetic model the altered activity of proteins in some diseases such as the amyloid beta protein in alzheimer s disease must be modeled at the molecular level to accurately predict the effect on cognition ion channels which are vital to the propagation of action potentials are another molecule that may be modeled to more accurately reflect biological processes for instance to accurately model synaptic plasticity the strengthening or weakening of synapses and memory it is necessary to model the activity of the nmda receptor nmdar the speed at which the nmda receptor lets calcium ions into the cell in response to glutamate is an important determinant of long term potentiation via the insertion of ampa receptors ampar into the plasma membrane at the synapse of the postsynaptic cell the cell that receives the neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell in

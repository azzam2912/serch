this drug was first cited in 1991 rti 55 is a non selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor derived from methylecgonidine however more selective analogs are derived by conversion to pyrrolidinoamido rti 229 for instance due to the large bulbous nature of the weakly electron withdrawing iodo halogen atom rti 55 is the most strongly serotonergic of the simple para substituted troparil based analogs in rodents rti 55 actually caused death at a dosage of 100 mg kg whereas rti 51 and rti 31 did not another notable observation is the strong propensity of rti 55 to cause locomotor activity enhancements although in an earlier study rti 51 was actually even stronger than rti 55 in shifting baseline lma this observation serves to highlight the disparities that can arise between studies rti 55 is one of the most potent phenyltropane stimulants commercially available which limits its use in humans as it might have significant abuse potential if used outside a strictly controlled medical setting however it is definitely worthy of mentioning that increasing the size of the halogen atom attached to troparil serves to reduce the number of lever responses in a session when these analogs were compared in a study although

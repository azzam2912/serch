it was an afterburning turbojet with a unique compressor bleed to the afterburner which gave increased thrust at high speeds because of the wide speed range of the aircraft the engine needed two modes of operation to take it from stationary on the ground to at altitude it was a conventional afterburning turbojet for take off and acceleration to mach 2 and then used permanent compressor bleed to the afterburner above mach 2 the way the engine worked at cruise led it to be described as acting like a turboramjet it has also been described as a turboramjet based on incorrect statements describing the turbomachinery as being completely bypassed the engine performance which met the mission requirements for the cia and usaf over many years was later enhanced slightly for nasa experimental work carrying external payloads on the top of the aircraft which required more thrust to deal with higher aircraft drag the j58 had its origins in the larger jt9 j91 engine it was a 3 4 scale jt9 with a mass flow of down from and known by the company designation jt11 the jt11 was initially proposed to the us navy with the navy designation j58 it was

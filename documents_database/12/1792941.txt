located southeast of the sigsbee knolls the campeche knolls are bounded by campeche bank to the east the bay of campeche to the south and the salt free abyssal plain called the veracruz tongue to the west salt deposition is inferred to have occurred in the late jurassic during the rifting stage of the gulf equivalent to the louann salt of the texas louisiana slope multibeam echosounder images collected during r v sonne cruise so174 show the northern campeche knolls as distinct elongated hills that average in size with reliefs of and slopes of 10 to 20 percent the campeche knolls are covered with a thick column of sediments above the salt unit with sediment thickness reaching depending upon water depth and distance from the southern coast the thick sediments provided prolific petroleum source rocks with the most productive one being of latest jurassic and cretaceous age hydrocarbon generation makes campeche knolls a highly ranked and prolific petroleum region with studies showing that salt activity supports leakage of gas and oil the potential for gas hydrate accumulations in the campeche knolls was demonstrated as early as 1970 with the retrieval of gassy cores from site 88 drilled during leg 10

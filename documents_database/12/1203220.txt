pmdta is a basic bulky and flexible tridentate ligand that is a used in organolithium chemistry it is a colorless liquid although impure samples appear yellowish pmdta is prepared from diethylenetriamine by the eschweiler clarke reaction involving the use of formaldehyde and formic acid unlike diethylenetriamine all three amines in pmdta are tertiary both pmdta and diethylenetriamine are tridentate ligands that form two five membered chelate rings the donating properties of the amino groups of diethylenetriamine are greater than that of pmdta in copper ii complexes both ligands can coordinate metal complexes in arrangements where the three nitrogen centers are co planar or mutually cis pmdta is used to modify the reactivity of organolithium compounds which deaggregate in the presence of lewis bases to enhance their reactivity commonly the di tertiary amine tmeda is used in these applications it binds to the lithium center as a bidentate ligand pmdta behaves analogously but since it is tridentate it binds more strongly to lithium in contrast to tmeda pmdta forms monomeric complexes with organolithium compounds both amines affect the regiochemistry of metalation in the pmdta n buli adducts the li c bonds are highly polarized thus increasing the basicity of the butyl

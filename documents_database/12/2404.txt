otherwise a function is said to be a discontinuous function a continuous function with a continuous inverse function is called a homeomorphism continuity of functions is one of the core concepts of topology which is treated in full generality below the introductory portion of this article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are real numbers a stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity in addition this article discusses the definition for the more general case of functions between two metric spaces in order theory especially in domain theory one considers a notion of continuity known as scott continuity other forms of continuity do exist but they are not discussed in this article as an example consider the function h t which describes the height of a growing flower at time t this function is continuous by contrast if m t denotes the amount of money in a bank account at time t then the function jumps at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn so the function m t is discontinuous a form of the epsilon delta definition of continuity was first given by bernard bolzano in 1817 augustin louis cauchy

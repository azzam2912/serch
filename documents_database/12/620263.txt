all the estimates explicitly use the de broglie theory about wave properties of reflected atoms the ridges enhance the quantum reflection from the surface reducing the effective constant formula 1 of the van der waals attraction of atoms to the surface such interpretation leads to the estimate of the reflectivity where formula 3 is width of the ridges formula 4 is distance between ridges formula 5 is grazing angle and formula 6 is wavenumber and formula 7 is coefficient of reflection of atoms with wavenumber formula 8 from a flat surface at the normal incidence such estimate predicts the enhancement of the reflectivity at the increase of period formula 4 this estimate is valid at formula 10 see quantum reflection for the approximation fit of the function formula 11 for narrow ridges with large period formula 12 the ridges just blocks the part of the wavefront then it can be interpreted in terms of the fresnel diffraction of the de broglie wave or the zeno effect such interpretation leads to the estimate the reflectivity where the grazing angle formula 5 is supposed to be small this estimate predicts enhancement of the reflectivity at the reduction of period formula 4 this

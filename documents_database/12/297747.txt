a related concept is that of progenote luca is not thought to be the first life on earth but only one of many early organisms all the others becoming extinct while there is no specific fossil evidence of luca it can be studied by comparing the genomes of all modern organisms its descendants by this means a 2016 study identified a set of 355 genes most likely to have been present in luca however some of those genes could have developed later then spread universally by horizontal gene transfer between archaea and bacteria the genes describe a complex life form with many co adapted features including transcription and translation mechanisms to convert information from dna to rna to proteins the study concluded that the luca probably lived in the high temperature water of deep sea vents near ocean floor magma flows studies from 2000 to 2018 have suggested an increasingly ancient time for luca in 2000 estimations suggested luca existed 3 5 to 3 8 billion years ago in the paleoarchean era a few hundred million years after the earliest fossil evidence of life for which there are several candidates ranging in age from 3 48 to 4 28 billion

it has been observed that many technologies although invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems often create other problems in the process known as externalities in other words there would be modification of the basic hardware modification of techniques and procedures or both technological fix is the idea that all problems can find solutions in better and new technologies it now is used as a dismissive phrase to describe cheap quick fixes by using inappropriate technologies these fixes often create more problems than they solve or give people a sense that they have solved the problem in the contemporary context technological fix is sometimes used to refer to the idea of using data and intelligent algorithms to supplement and improve human decision making in hope that this would result in ameliorating the bigger problem one critic evgeny morozov defines this as recasting all complex social situations either as neat problems with definite computable solutions or as transparent and self evident processes that can be easily optimized if only the right algorithms are in place while some criticizes this approach to the issues of today as detrimental to efforts to truly solve these problems opponents finds merits in such approach

humans cattle and dogs serve as natural hosts there are currently 21 species in this genus including the type species ungulate bocaparvovirus 1 diseases associated with this genus include human acute respiratory illness cattle diarrhea and mild respiratory symptoms bocaviruses were first described in animals in the early 1960s like the other members of this family bocaparvoviruses have two open reading frames orf1 and 2 unique among parvoviruses the bocaparvoviruses contain a third open reading frame between non structural and structural coding regions this gene encodes a highly phosphorylated nonstructural protein np1 orf1 encodes a nonstructural protein ns1 that is involved in viral genome replication orf2 encodes the two capsid proteins vp1 and vp2 like other parvoviruses the vp1 unique region contains a phospholipase a 2 motif with a conserved histidine aspartic acid xxy motif in the catalytic center group ssdna order unassigned in the parvoviridae species are now generally defined as a cluster of viruses that encode replication initiator proteins called ns1 that have amino acid sequences that are at least 85 identical to those encoded by all other members of the species there are currently twenty one recognized species of bocaparvovirus they are carnivore bocaparvovirus 1 6 chiropteran

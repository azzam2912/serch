the size of a ditone varies according to the sizes of the two tones of which it is compounded the largest is the pythagorean ditone with a ratio of 81 64 also called a comma redundant major third the smallest is the interval with a ratio of 100 81 also called a comma deficient major third the pythagorean ditone is the major third in pythagorean tuning which has an interval ratio of 81 64 which is 407 82 cents the pythagorean ditone is evenly divisible by two major tones 9 8 or 203 91 cents and is wider than a just major third 5 4 386 31 cents by a syntonic comma 81 80 21 51 cents because it is a comma wider than a perfect major third of 5 4 it is called a comma redundant interval the major third that appears commonly in the pythagorean system c e d f etc is more properly known as the pythagorean ditone and consists of two major and two minor semitones 2m 2m this is the interval that is extremely sharp at 408c the pure major third is only 386c it may also be thought of as four justly tuned fifths

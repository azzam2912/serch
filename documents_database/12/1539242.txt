seismic interferometry si utilizes the crosscorrelation of signal pairs to reconstruct the impulse response of a given media papers by keiiti aki 1957 g za kunetz and jon claerbout 1968 helped develop the technique for seismic applications and provided the framework upon which modern theory is based a signal at a location a can be crosscorrelated with a signal at a location b to reproduce a virtual source receiver pair using seismic interferometry crosscorrelation is often considered the key mathematical operation in this approach but it is also possible to use convolution to come up with a similar result the crosscorrelation of passive noise measured at a free surface reproduces the subsurface impulse response as such it is possible to obtain information about the subsurface with no need for an active seismic source this method however is not limited to passive sources and can be extended for use with active sources and computer generated waveforms as of 2006 the field of seismic interferometry was beginning to change the way geophysicists view noise seismic interferometry uses this previously ignored noise in models of the shallow subsurface potential applications include both research and industry claerbout 1968 developed a workflow to apply existing

a further uprating may be done by adding another stage in front of the previously added zero stage in which case the new one may be known as a zero zero stage a comparison with other ways of uprating an existing engine without drastically redesigning the engine shows for a particular case e g the rolls royce snecma m45h the thrust could have been increased by 25 with a zero staged l p compressor or 10 with either an improved hp turbine or with water injection zero staging is also combined with other modifications to provide increased thrust or lower turbine temperature it may be required for an existing aircraft weight increase or for a new application as shown by the following examples a 15 stage rolls royce avon powered the lightning f 1 a zero stage together with a new turbine was added total 16 stages for the caravelle iii a zero zero stage was added total 17 stages for the caravelle vi the 7 stage snecma atar d was used in the mystere ii a zero stage was added total 8 stages for the e and g used in the vautour and super mystere b 2 a zero

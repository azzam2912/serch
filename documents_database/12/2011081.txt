in this sense an fss is a type of optical filter or metal mesh optical filters in which the filtering is accomplished by virtue of the regular periodic usually metallic but sometimes dielectric pattern on the surface of the fss though not explicitly mentioned in the name fss s also have properties which vary with incidence angle and polarization as well these are unavoidable consequences of the way in which fss s are constructed frequency selective surfaces have been most commonly used in the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum and find use in applications as diverse as the aforementioned microwave oven antenna radomes and modern metamaterials sometimes frequency selective surfaces are referred to simply as periodic surfaces and are a 2 dimensional analog of the new periodic volumes known as photonic crystals many factors are involved in understanding the operation and application of frequency selective surfaces these include analysis techniques operating principles design principles manufacturing techniques and methods for integrating these structures into space ground and airborne platforms historically the first approach to solving for fields reflected and transmitted by fss was the spectral domain method sdm and it is still a valuable tool even today scott 1989

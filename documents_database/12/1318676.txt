the name of these species originated in the javanese language as linsang or wlinsang and previously was translated incorrectly in english dictionaries as otter the two african species belong to the family viverridae and the two asiatic species belong to the family prionodontidae formerly both linsang genera the african poiana and the asian prionodon were placed in the subfamily viverrinae of viverridae along with several other genera but recent research suggests that their relationships may be somewhat different the linsangs are remarkable for their morphological resemblance to cats family felidae which is greater than in the other viverrids as the relationship between linsangs and cats was thought to be rather distant the two groups belonging to different families within the superfamily feliformia this was considered an example of convergent evolution dna analysis indicates that while the african linsangs poiana are true viverrids closely related to the genets however the asiatic linsangs prionodon are not and instead may be the closest living relatives of the family felidae thus the similarities between asiatic linsangs and cats are more likely to be due to common ancestry while the similarities between the two genera of linsangs must be convergent linsangs are nocturnal generally solitary

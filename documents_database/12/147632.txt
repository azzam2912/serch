supergravity is the gauge theory of local supersymmetry since the supersymmetry susy generators form together with the poincar algebra a superalgebra called the super poincar algebra supersymmetry a gauge theory makes gravity arise in a natural way in simple terms scientists have identified four basic forces behind everything happening around us they are electromagnetic force the reason why electricity is produced or medicines give us relief weak force which relates to radioactivity strong force the force that binds up protons and neutrons within the atom and gravitational force the reason why apples fall to the ground and the moon revolves around the earth quantum theory can explain the first three types of forces pertinent to atomic level however for big objects quantum theory is not applicable therefore gravitational force is only applied in astronomical science and studies these two theories simultaneously may explain all however scientists were finding a theory that may explain both quantum theory and theory of gravitation together a theory of everything the theory of supergravity revolves around this intention to establish a theory that is applicable everywhere like any field theory of gravity a supergravity theory contains a spin 2 field whose quantum is the graviton

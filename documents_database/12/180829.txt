it was visited by the giotto probe in july 1992 the spacecraft came as close as 200 km but could not take pictures because some instruments were damaged from its encounter with halley s comet the comet was discovered in 1902 by john grigg of new zealand and rediscovered in its next appearance in 1922 by john francis skjellerup an australian then living and working for about two decades in south africa where he was a founder member of the astronomical society of southern africa in 1987 it was belatedly discovered by ubor kres k that the comet had been observed in 1808 as well by jean louis pons the comet has often suffered the gravitational influence of jupiter which has altered its orbit considerably for instance its perihelion distance has changed from 0 77 au in 1725 to 0 89 au in 1922 to 0 99 au in 1977 and to 1 12 au in 1999 having its recent perihelion so close to earth s orbit made it an easy target to reach for the giotto mission spacecraft in 1992 whose primary mission was to comet halley giotto had a closest approach to grigg skjellerup of 200 km much

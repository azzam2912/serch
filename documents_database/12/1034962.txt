the digital image processing engine can perform a range of tasks to increase the system integration on embedded devices often it is a system on a chip with multi core processor architecture the photodiodes employed in an image sensor are color blind by nature they can only record shades of grey to get color into the picture they are covered with different color filters red green and blue rgb according to the pattern designated by the bayer filter named after its inventor as each photodiode records the color information for exactly one pixel of the image without an image processor there would be a green pixel next to each red and blue pixel actually with most sensors there are two green for each blue and red diodes this process however is quite complex and involves a number of different operations its quality depends largely on the effectiveness of the algorithms applied to the raw data coming from the sensor the mathematically manipulated data becomes the photo file recorded as stated above the image processor evaluates the color and brightness data of a given pixel compares them with the data from neighboring pixels and then uses a demosaicing algorithm to produce

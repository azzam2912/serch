it is intended to avoid traffic congestion caused by large numbers of high occupancy vehicles crossing several lanes near exits most highway hov lanes are the leftmost inside lane while most exits and entrances connect to the rightmost outside lane immediately after entering the highway then high occupancy vehicles must change lanes several times to get to the hov lane and reverse this process when they near their exit worse many hovs are large transit vehicles such as vans and buses this lane crossing can significantly exacerbate congestion particularly if traffic is already too congested for drivers to comfortably make these lane changes at speed the texas t avoids much of this lane changing by providing vehicles in the left hov lane i e buses and carpools with an exit directly from the leftmost lane similarly when entering the expressway vehicles can merge directly into the leftmost lane the ramp has a t shape because typically the most important destination for traffic is a transit center or business district located to one side of the expressway and the ramp provides access only to and from this side the bridge does not completely cross the expressway but terminates in the middle

the balance between the gtp bound active and gdp bound inactive states is regulated by the opposite action of proteins activating the gtpase activity and that of proteins which promote the loss of bound gdp and the uptake of fresh gtp the latter proteins are known as guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulators gdss or also as guanine nucleotide releasing or exchange factors grfs proteins that act as gds can be classified into at least two families on the basis of sequence similarities the cdc24 family see and this cdc25 rasgef family the size of the proteins of the cdc25 family range from 309 residues lte1 to 1596 residues sos the sequence similarity shared by all these proteins is limited to a region of about 250 amino acids generally located in their c terminal section currently the only exceptions are sos and ralgds where this domain makes up the central part of the protein this domain has been shown in cdc25 an scd25 to be essential for the activity of these proteins kndc1 plce1 ralgds ralgps1 ralgps2 rapgef1 rapgef2 rapgef3 rapgef4 rapgef5 rapgef6 rapgefl1 rasgef1a rasgef1b rasgef1c rasgrf1 rasgrf2 rasgrp1 rasgrp2 rasgrp3 rasgrp4 rgl1 rgl2 rgl3 rgl4 rgr sos1 sos2

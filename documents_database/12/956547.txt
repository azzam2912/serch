the chain is about 40 km 25 mi long and the identified volcanic features include 48 cinder cones eight lava domes and 15 maars and explosion craters its highest point is the lava dome of puy de d me located near the middle of the chain which is high the name of the range comes from a french term puy that refers to a volcanic mountain with a rounded profile a date of 4040 bce is usually given for the last eruption of a cha ne des puys volcano the location became a world heritage site in 2018 the chain began to form approximately 95 000 years ago and the volcanic activity that formed the range stopped about 10 000 years ago the majority of the cones were formed by strombolian eruptions and these cones usually have well defined summit craters some have nested craters and others show broken rims where lava poured through in contrast puy de d me was created by a pel an eruption this type of eruption is characterized by long dormant periods periodically interrupted by sudden extremely violent eruptions the chain was the subject of the pioneering research of english geologist george julius poulett scrope

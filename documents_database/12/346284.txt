perhaps the chief use of the inverse gamma distribution is in bayesian statistics where the distribution arises as the marginal posterior distribution for the unknown variance of a normal distribution if an uninformative prior is used and as an analytically tractable conjugate prior if an informative prior is required hoff 2009 74 however it is common among bayesians to consider an alternative parametrization of the normal distribution in terms of the precision defined as the reciprocal of the variance which allows the gamma distribution to be used directly as a conjugate prior other bayesians prefer to parametrize the inverse gamma distribution differently as a scaled inverse chi squared distribution the inverse gamma distribution s probability density function is defined over the support formula 6 with shape parameter formula 8 and scale parameter formula 9 here formula 10 denotes the gamma function unlike the gamma distribution which contains a somewhat similar exponential term formula 9 is a scale parameter as the distribution function satisfies the cumulative distribution function is the regularized gamma function where the numerator is the upper incomplete gamma function and the denominator is the gamma function many math packages allow direct computation of formula 14 the regularized gamma

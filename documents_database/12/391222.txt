for both algebra and coalgebra a functor is a convenient and general way of organizing a signature this has applications in computer science examples of coalgebras include lazy infinite data structures such as streams and also transition systems formula 1 coalgebras are dual to formula 1 algebras just as the class of all algebras for a given signature and equational theory form a variety so does the class of all formula 1 coalgebras satisfying a given equational theory form a covariety where the signature is given by formula 1 let be an endofunctor on a category formula 8 an formula 1 coalgebra is an object formula 10 of formula 8 together with a morphism of formula 8 usually written as formula 14 an formula 1 coalgebra homomorphism from formula 14 to another formula 1 coalgebra formula 18 is a morphism in formula 8 such that thus the formula 1 coalgebras for a given functor f constitute a category the set of conatural numbers formula 23 consisting of the non negative integers and also infinity when equipped with the function formula 24 given by formula 25 formula 26 for formula 27 and formula 28 is a coalgebra of the endofunctor formula

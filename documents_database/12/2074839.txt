they were later studied by various other research groups in 2014 start up power japan plus announced plans to commercialize its version named the ryden colead kaname takeya is known for his work on the toyota prius and tesla model s the company claimed that its cell offers energy density comparable to a lithium ion battery more rapid charge rate a longer functional lifetime 3k cycles improved safety and cradle to cradle sustainability the company claimed that its battery charges 20 times faster than conventional lithium ion batteries is rated for more than 3 000 cycles and can slot directly into existing manufacturing processes without changes to existing manufacturing lines as an electrolyte the cell uses one or more lithium salts in an aprotic organic solvent these remain unspecified but as an example in a patent the group uses a system consisting of lithium hexafluorophosphate as the salt and ethylene carbonate ec and dimethyl carbonate dmc mixed in a 1 2 volume ratio as solvent both electrodes are based on graphitic carbon graphite with the right grain size is obtained by pyrolyzing cotton precipitation and dissolution of a lithium salt takes place at any location where the electrolyte is present

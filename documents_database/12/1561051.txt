populations of this species have historically been included in miniopterus manavi but molecular data published in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this supposed species in fact consists of five separate species including the newly described m mahafaliensis the species has been found in dry spiny and gallery forest as well as more open habitats in southwestern madagascar miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small brown miniopterus its forearm length is 35 to 40 mm 1 4 to 1 6 in the hairs of the underparts have gray tips the tragus a projection in the outer ear is thick and blunt tipped the uropatagium tail membrane is well furred and the palate is concave during the 2000s molecular studies have revealed that the widely distributed african eurasian and australian genus miniopterus is much more species rich than previously thought in a 1995 contribution to faune de madagascar on malagasy bats randolph peterson and colleagues listed four species of miniopterus on madagascar and the nearby comoros including the small miniopterus manavi with a broad distribution on both madagascar and the comoros in 2008 and 2009 however steven goodman and colleagues presented evidence that the former concept of m manavi in fact encompassed five morphologically

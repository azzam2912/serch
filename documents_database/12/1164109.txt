hydrus suite of software is supported by an interactive graphics based interface for data preprocessing discretization of the soil profile and graphic presentation of the results while hydrus 1d simulates water flow solute and heat transport in one dimension and is a public domain software hydrus 2d 3d extends the simulation capabilities to the second and third dimensions and is distributed commercially hydrus 1d traces its roots to the early work of van genuchten and his sumatra and worm models as well as later work by vogel 1987 and kool and van genuchten 1989 and their swmi and hydrus models respectively while hermitian cubic finite element numerical schemes were used in sumatra and linear finite elements in worm and the older hydrus code for solution of both the water flow and solute transport equations swmi used finite differences to solve the flow equation various features of these four early models were combined first in the dos based swmi st model im nek et al 1993 and later in the windows based hydrus 1d simulator im nek et al 1998 after releasing versions 1 for 16 bit windows 3 1 and 2 for 32 bit windows 95 the next two major

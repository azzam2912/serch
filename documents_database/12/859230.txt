evolution strategies es are stochastic derivative free methods for numerical optimization of non linear or non convex continuous optimization problems they belong to the class of evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation an evolutionary algorithm is broadly based on the principle of biological evolution namely the repeated interplay of variation via recombination and mutation and selection in each generation iteration new individuals candidate solutions denoted as formula 1 are generated by variation usually in a stochastic way of the current parental individuals then some individuals are selected to become the parents in the next generation based on their fitness or objective function value formula 2 like this over the generation sequence individuals with better and better formula 3 values are generated in an evolution strategy new candidate solutions are sampled according to a multivariate normal distribution in formula 4 recombination amounts to selecting a new mean value for the distribution mutation amounts to adding a random vector a perturbation with zero mean pairwise dependencies between the variables in the distribution are represented by a covariance matrix the covariance matrix adaptation cma is a method to update the covariance matrix of this distribution this is particularly useful if the function formula 3

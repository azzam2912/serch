a wicket maiden is a maiden over in which a wicket is also taken similarly double and triple wicket maidens are when two and three wickets are taken in a maiden over after six deliveries the umpire calls over the fielding team switches ends and a different bowler is selected to bowl from the opposite end the captain of the fielding team decides which bowler will bowl any given over and no bowler may bowl two overs in succession although this has not always been so with overs of four and eight balls used in the past currently an over must consist of six legal deliveries if the bowler bowls a wide or a no ball that illegal delivery is not counted towards the six ball tally and another delivery will need to be bowled in its place in the event that a bowler is injured or is sent out of the attack by the umpire for disciplinary reasons such as bowling beamers during the middle of an over a teammate completes any remaining deliveries because a bowler may not bowl consecutive overs the general tactic is for the captain to appoint two bowlers to alternate overs from opposite ends

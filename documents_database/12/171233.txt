those numbers that do not end in 1 are formula 1 unhappy numbers or formula 1 sad numbers the origin of happy numbers is not clear happy numbers were brought to the attention of reg allenby a british author and senior lecturer in pure mathematics at leeds university by his daughter who had learned of them at school however they may have originated in russia more formally let formula 6 be a natural number given the perfect digital invariant function for base formula 8 a number formula 6 is formula 1 happy if there exists a formula 11 such that formula 12 where formula 13 represents the formula 11 th iteration of formula 15 and formula 1 unhappy otherwise if a number is a nontrivial perfect digital invariant of formula 15 then it is formula 1 unhappy for example 19 is 10 happy as for example 347 is 6 happy as there are infinitely many formula 1 happy numbers as 1 is a formula 1 happy number and for every formula 6 formula 29 formula 30 in base formula 1 is formula 1 happy since its sum is 1 indeed the happiness of a number is preserved by removing or

it is the categorical construction dual to the equalizer hence the name a coequalizer is a colimit of the diagram consisting of two objects x and y and two parallel morphisms f g x y more explicitly a coequalizer can be defined as an object q together with a morphism q y q such that q f q g moreover the pair q q must be universal in the sense that given any other such pair q q there exists a unique morphism u q q such that u q q this information can be captured by the following commutative diagram as with all universal constructions a coequalizer if it exists is unique up to a unique isomorphism this is why by abuse of language one sometimes speaks of the coequalizer of two parallel arrows it can be shown that a coequalizer q is an epimorphism in any category in categories with zero morphisms one can define a cokernel of a morphism f as the coequalizer of f and the parallel zero morphism in preadditive categories it makes sense to add and subtract morphisms the hom sets actually form abelian groups in such categories one can define the coequalizer of

it only compresses single files and is not a file archiver it is developed by julian seward and maintained by federico mena seward made the first public release of bzip2 version 0 15 in july 1996 the compressor s stability and popularity grew over the next several years and seward released version 1 0 in late 2000 following a nine year hiatus of updates for the project since 2010 on june 4 2019 federico mena accepted maintainership of the bzip2 project bzip2 compresses most files more effectively than the older lzw z and deflate zip and gz compression algorithms but is considerably slower lzma is generally more space efficient than bzip2 at the expense of even slower compression speed while having much faster decompression bzip2 compresses data in blocks of size between 100 and 900 kb and uses the burrows wheeler transform to convert frequently recurring character sequences into strings of identical letters it then applies move to front transform and huffman coding bzip2 s ancestor bzip used arithmetic coding instead of huffman the change was made because of a software patent restriction bzip2 performance is asymmetric as decompression is relatively fast motivated by the large cpu time required for

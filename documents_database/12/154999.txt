these channels can be activated opened by either electrical means or by increasing calcium concentrations in the cell bk channels help regulate physiological processes such as circadian behavioral rhythms and neuronal excitability bk channels are also involved in many processes in the body as it is a ubiquitous channel they have a tetrameric structure that is composed of a transmembrane domain voltage sensing domain potassium channel domain and a cytoplasmic c terminal domain with many x ray structures for reference their function is to repolarize the membrane potential by allowing for potassium to flow outward in response to a depolarization or increase in calcium levels structurally bk channels are homologous to voltage and ligand gated potassium channels having a voltage sensor and pore as the membrane spanning domain and a cytosolic domain for the binding of intracellular calcium and magnesium each monomer of the channel forming alpha subunit is the product of the kcnma1 gene also known as slo1 the slo1 subunit has three main structural domains each with a distinct function the voltage sensing domain vsd senses membrane potential across the membrane the cytosolic domain senses calcium concentration ca ions and the pore gate domain pgd which opens and

the software performs a battery of in silico tests to estimate the impact of the variant on the gene product protein tests are made on both protein and dna level mutationtaster is hence not limited to substitutions of single amino acids but can also handle synonymous or intronic variants many genetic disorders can be caused by mutation of a single gene new sequencing techniques however have shown that a single individual can have up to 3 5 million alterations in the whole genome most of which do not have a detrimental health effect the challenge of prediction tools is thus to filter harmless mutations from disease causing ones it is important to note that these tools are not designed to predict sources of complex diseases such as cancer the latter usually do not have a monogenic causation but are caused by multiple gene defects that develop cumulatively into a disease mutation taster is written in perl and can process next generation sequencing data of all major platforms roche 454 illumina genome analyzer and abi solid the program first discards mutations that are known harmless polymorphisms by comparison with the integrated databases the remaining snps single nucleotide polymorphism are tested according

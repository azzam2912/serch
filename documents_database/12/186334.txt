classically cells were thought to enter g primarily due to environmental factors like nutrient deprivation that limited the resources necessary for proliferation thus it was thought of as a resting phase g is now known to take different forms and occur for multiple reasons for example most adult neuronal cells among the most metabolically active cells in the body are fully differentiated and reside in a terminal g phase neurons reside in this state not because of stochastic or limited nutrient supply but as a part of their internal genetic programming g was first suggested as a cell state based on early cell cycle studies when the first studies defined the four phases of the cell cycle using radioactive labeling techniques it was discovered that not all cells in a population proliferate at similar rates a population s growth fraction or the fraction of the population that was growing was actively proliferating but other cells existed in a non proliferative state some of these non proliferating cells could respond to extrinsic stimuli and proliferate by re entering the cell cycle early contrasting views either considered non proliferating cells to simply be in an extended g phase or in a cell

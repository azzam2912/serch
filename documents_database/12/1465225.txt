the tandem undercarriage proved to be unsatisfactory and there were serious flight stability problems related to the delta wing enough so that it never flew after an accident during taxiing tests a june 1950 council of ministers directive ordered yakovlev to develop a supersonic fighter that used the lyul ka al 5 axial compressor turbojet based on a recommendation from one of tsagi aerodynamicists yakovlev was directed to use the rhomboid or cropped delta shaped wing covered in captured german research the directive was extremely ambitious as it required the maximum speed to be mach 1 7 at a time when the world speed record was barely over the sound barrier this requirement had to be revised when the al 5 was delayed and a substitute engine had to be chosen no other soviet turbojet offered the same sort of power as the al 5 so the project was recast as a technology demonstrator to evaluate the novel wing aerodynamics the klimov rd 500 was chosen and the maximum speed was expected to be at a takeoff weight of the yak 1000 had a circular section semi monocoque fuselage with the engine air intake in the nose the engine was

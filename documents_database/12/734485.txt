his early education was at juilly france he then proceeded to paris where he studied medicine receiving a doctorate for a thesis entitled essai sur cette question d conomie m dicale convient il qu un malade soit instruit de sa situation budan died in paris on 6 october 1840 budan explains in his book how given a monic polynomial p x the coefficients of p x 1 can be obtained by developing a pascal like triangle with first row the coefficients of p x rather than by expanding successive powers of x 1 as in pascal s triangle proper and then summing thus the method has the flavour of lattice path combinatorics taken together with descartes rule of signs this leads to an upper bound on the number of the real roots a polynomial has inside an open interval although budan s theorem as this result was known was taken up by among others 1779 1854 in his celebrated algebra textbook it tended to be eclipsed by an equivalent result due to joseph fourier as the consequence of a priority dispute interest in budan s theorem has been revived because some further computational results are more easily deducible from it

in 1899 the same sequence was mentioned explicitly by fran ois olivier raoul perrin the most extensive treatment of this sequence was given by adams and shanks 1982 the generating function of the perrin sequence is the perrin sequence numbers can be written in terms of powers of the roots of the equation this equation has 3 roots one real root p known as the plastic number and two complex conjugate roots q and r given these three roots the perrin sequence analogue of the lucas sequence binet formula is since the magnitudes of the complex roots q and r are both less than 1 the powers of these roots approach 0 for large n for large n the formula reduces to this formula can be used to quickly calculate values of the perrin sequence for large n the ratio of successive terms in the perrin sequence approaches p a k a the plastic number which has a value of approximately 1 324718 this constant bears the same relationship to the perrin sequence as the golden ratio does to the lucas sequence similar connections exist also between p and the padovan sequence between the golden ratio and fibonacci numbers and

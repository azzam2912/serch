the channels are formed by large protein complexes that run across the membrane they cross the cell membrane connecting the cytosol or cytoplasm to the extracellular matrix transmembrane channels are also found in the membranes of organelles including the nucleus the endoplasmic reticulum the golgi apparatus mitochondria chloroplasts and lysosomes transmembrane channels differ from transporters and pumps in several ways channels are not as selective as transporters and pumps differentiating solutes primarily by size and ionic charge channels perform passive transport of materials also known as facilitated diffusion transporters can carry out either passive or active transfer of materials while pumps require energy to act there are several modes by which membrane channels operate the most common is the gated channel which requires a trigger such as a change in membrane potential in voltage gated channels to unlock or lock the pore opening voltage gated channels are critical to the production of an action potential in neurons resulting in a nerve impulse a ligand gated channel requires a chemical such as a neurotransmitter to activate the channel stress gated channels require a mechanical force applied to the channel for opening aquaporins are dedicated channels for the movement of water across

the winding number depends on the orientation of the curve and is negative if the curve travels around the point clockwise winding numbers are fundamental objects of study in algebraic topology and they play an important role in vector calculus complex analysis geometric topology differential geometry and physics including string theory suppose we are given a closed oriented curve in the xy plane we can imagine the curve as the path of motion of some object with the orientation indicating the direction in which the object moves then the winding number of the curve is equal to the total number of counterclockwise turns that the object makes around the origin when counting the total number of turns counterclockwise motion counts as positive while clockwise motion counts as negative for example if the object first circles the origin four times counterclockwise and then circles the origin once clockwise then the total winding number of the curve is three using this scheme a curve that does not travel around the origin at all has winding number zero while a curve that travels clockwise around the origin has negative winding number therefore the winding number of a curve may be any integer the

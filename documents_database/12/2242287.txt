the juno radiation vault is roughly a cube with walls made of 1 cm thick 1 3 of an inch titanium metal and each side having an area of about a square meter 10 square feet the vault weights about 200 kg 500 lbs inside the vault are the main command and data handling and power control boxes along with 20 other electronic boxes the vault should reduce the radiation exposure by about 800 times as the spacecraft is exposed to an anticipated 20 million rads of radiation it does not stop all radiation but significantly reduces it in order to limit damage to the spacecraft s electronics the vault has been compared being like armor or like a tank and the electronics within like the spacecraft s brain the power systems have been described as a heart the vault is one of many features of the mission to help counter the high radiation levels near jupiter including an orbit that reduces time spent in the highest radiation regions radiation hardened electronics and additional shielding on components the wires that lead out from the vault also have increased protection they have a sheath of braided copper and stainless steel some

they contain four or five extant genera with 13 20 living species but can be divided into several subfamilies they may be a nuisance but compared to the drywood termites kalotermitidae usually do not cause extensive damage to buildings or other man made structures as their name implies they eat wood that is not dried out perhaps even rotting and consequently of little use to humans the termites as a group were traditionally placed in the exopterygota but such an indiscriminate treatment makes that group a paraphyletic grade of basal neopterans thus the termites and their closest relatives like the cockroaches relatives are now separated in a clade called dictyoptera the dampwood termites are sometimes included with the harvester termites hodotermitidae but this is not followed by the majority of authors and indeed the two families seem to represent distinct lineages which both merely retain some similar plesiomorphies and are generally among the more basal isoptera two of the subfamilies usually placed in the termopsidae are monotypic the other one contains three living genera however stolotermes is somewhat aberrant and its placement in the termopsidae is in need of scrutiny current understanding suggests it might be better considered much closer

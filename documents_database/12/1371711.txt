for all golfers it consists of a pre stroke in which golfers choose which club they want and their stance and the actual stroke the stroke is a complex motion and there is still disagreement on what constitutes a good golf swing in work and power analysis of the golf swing nesbit and serrano suggest the golf swing has been studied by scientists and mathematicians who have developed various equations to help explain the complexity of the swing it is generally agreed that a successful and consistent golf swing requires precise timing and mechanics from the grip and position of one s fingers to the position and movement of the feet at any moment of the swing whether back swing downswing or upswing something can go wrong that will throw off the whole body and result in a mishit the entire swing motion should move on a plane in a fluid manner the plane can be characterized as horizontal or vertical the goal of the golf swing is to direct as much kinetic energy as possible into the club head so when it comes into contact with the ball all of the energy will transfer to the ball sending it

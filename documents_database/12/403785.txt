a case has been made for artistic continuity in europe from the bronze age and indeed the preceding neolithic age however archaeologists generally use celtic to refer to the culture of the european iron age from around 1000 bc onwards until the conquest by the roman empire of most of the territory concerned and art historians typically begin to talk about celtic art only from the la t ne period broadly 5th to 1st centuries bc onwards early celtic art is another term used for this period stretching in britain to about 150 ad the early medieval art of britain and ireland which produced the book of kells and other masterpieces and is what celtic art evokes for much of the general public in the english speaking world is called insular art in art history this is the best known part but not the whole of the celtic art of the early middle ages which also includes the pictish art of scotland both styles absorbed considerable influences from non celtic sources but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects which are often extremely stylised when they do appear narrative scenes only appear under outside influence energetic circular forms

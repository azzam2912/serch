64 by the norwegian composer edvard grieg were written c 1896 and published in 1897 they draw their inspiration from the earlier folk works collected by ludvig mathias lindeman these pieces have become known latterly by being associated with the tv adaptations of e nesbit s book the railway children published in 1906 and thus almost contemporaneous with grieg s music the first two series were shown by the bbc in 1951 and 1957 and grieg s music was used in both with some scenes from the first series being re used for the second however the best known was the third series shown in 1968 which featured the actress jenny agutter as the eldest of the three children of the title again remarkably the same music was used and the most famously known piece was the slower and beautifully melodic excerpt from the second dance in fact this piece was only used as the closing theme perfectly suiting the poignancy of the emotionally moving storylines the opening music was actually another excerpt this time with a brighter piece taken from the fourth dance cleverly chosen to introduce the programmes with a somewhat lighter mood which subtly intertwines harmonic content

the dsl technology re uses existing copper telephone network cabling to provide bandwidth of up to 400 mbit s the technology also includes quality of service qos and efficient multicast genesis reported that two unnamed european telecom providers began testing the technology in july 2010 dsl rings technology combines the capabilities of vdsl2 dsl bonding resilient packet rings rpr technologies and add drop multiplexers adm in a collector ring instead of the historic tree and branch approach note that the links between the houses are implemented via passive jumper wires that do not come back to the convergence node cn in this way a single cn design can efficiently manage 2 16 houses in a given ring genesis suggests a maximum of 16 houses in the ring due to the delay introduced by transiting each node to get back to the central office co however rpr has an upper limit of 255 nodes in a ring bonded pairs are used to obtain maximum bandwidth from the co to the pedestal dp the convergence node which is environmentally hardened and powered via the copper wire from the co terminates the bonded signals and acts as the gateway node for the subscriber

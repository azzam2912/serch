the organization is similar to memory hierarchy where lower level chaches enjoy higher hit rates but longer hit latencies the architecture for hierarchical value cache is mainly organized along two approaches hierarchical unified value cache huvc and hierarchical combinational value cache hcvc this architecture of value cache employs all value caches storing full data values with larger value caches in the lower levels of the hierarchy this architecture suffers from high area overhead but reduces the bus switching activity the cache in huvc in managed by lru policy with each vc storing 32 bit values for incoming data it is simultaneously checked with the vc on each level with the uppermost vc hit getting encoded each hit at the level of the huvc incurs i bits switching activity by switching any bit of 32 bit data bus we can get 32 32 i i numbers that is we could have 32 32 i i entries however it would require complicated logic to map vc indexes to bus values for easy vc index encoding we partition the data bus into i segments and switch one bit in each segment thus the huvc scheme requires n control signals where n is the

the transposon is responsible for p trait of p element and it is found only in wild flies they are also found in many other eukaryotes the p element encodes for the protein p transposase unlike laboratory strain females wild type females are thought also to express an inhibitor to p transposase function from the very same element this inhibitor reduces the disruption to the genome caused by the p elements allowing fertile progeny evidence for this comes from crosses of laboratory females which lack p transposase inhibitor with wild type males which have p elements in the absence of the inhibitor the p elements can proliferate throughout the genome disrupting many genes and killing progeny p elements are commonly used as mutagenic agents in genetic experiments with drosophila one advantage of this approach is that the mutations are easy to locate in hybrid dysgenesis one strain of drosophila mates with another strain of drosophila producing hybrid offspring cause chromosomal damage known to be dysgenic hybrid dysgenesis requires a contribution from both parents for example in the p m system p strain contributing paternal and m strain contributing maternal the reverse cross with m father and p mother produces normal

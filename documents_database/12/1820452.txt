the populated islands of visayas were struck by an earthquake of magnitude 7 6 the earthquake has a depth of 45 km 27 9 miles a tsunami warning was announced within the pacific area and was later lifted after two hours the philippine archipelago is located in the pacific ring of fire where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common the philippine mobile belt is between the eurasia plate and the philippine sea plate the philippine sea plate is subducting along the philippine trench in this region at the latitude of the earthquake the philippine sea plate moves in the wnw direction at a velocity of approximately 100 mm yr with respect to the sunda plate this earthquake was an intraplate earthquake greater than 50 kilometers to the east of the boundary of the philippine sea plate this earthquake was unusual in that it occurred as a result of reverse faulting within the oceanic lithosphere of the philippine sea plate there have been approximately 40 events of m6 and above over the past 40 years within 250 km of this earthquake most of those earthquakes were the result of normal faulting within the shallower oceanic lithosphere rather than deeper reverse faulting

a p operation on l is a map formula 1 satisfying if the characteristic of k is 0 then l is a restricted lie algebra where the p operation is the identity map for any associative algebra a defined over a field of characteristic p the bracket operation formula 11 and p operation formula 12 make a into a restricted lie algebra formula 13 let g be an algebraic group over a field k of characteristic p and formula 14 be the zariski tangent space at the identity element of g each element of formula 14 uniquely defines a left invariant vector field on g and the commutator of vector fields defines a lie algebra structure on formula 14 just as in the lie group case if p 0 the frobenius map formula 17 defines a p operation on formula 14 the functor formula 19 has a left adjoint formula 20 called the restricted universal enveloping algebra to construct this let formula 21 be the universal enveloping algebra of l forgetting the p operation letting i be the two sided ideal generated by elements of the form formula 22 we set formula 23 it satisfies a form of the pbw

it contains about 200 species which range in habit from shrubs to small trees and is distributed throughout the new world tropics these plants are very closely related to psychotria and in particular its subgenus heteropsychotria indeed it seems to be nothing else but a distinctively flowered offshoot of heteropsychotria arguably it would thus need to be merged into psychotria to make that genus monophyletic but on the other hand psychotria is extremely diverse already so it is probably more practical to move the more distantly related species out of this genus and merge heteropsychotria with palicourea by a hungarian botanist attila borhidi some of the psychotria species have been transferred into this genus the genus is not well studied most species are distylous although a few on isolated caribbean islands seem to have lost the trait flowers are in racemes having no scent and are normally pollinated by hummingbirds blue black berries follow and are thought to be distributed by birds almost one tenth of the palicourea species are considered threatened by the iucn even though the conservation status has only been reviewed for those species that occur in ecuador

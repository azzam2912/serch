mimicry differs from camouflage as it is meant to be seen while animals use camouflage to remain hidden visual olfactory auditory biochemical and behavioral modalities of mimicry have been documented in vertebrates there are few well studied examples of mimicry in vertebrates still many of the basic types of mimicry apply to vertebrates especially among snakes batesian mimicry is rare among vertebrates but found in some reptiles particularly snakes and amphibians m llerian mimicry is found in some snakes birds amphibians and fish aggressive mimicry is known in some vertebrate predators and parasites while certain forms of sexual mimicry are distinctly more complex than in invertebrates batesian mimicry is a form of defense that allows a harmless species to mimic the appearance of a toxic noxious or harmful species to protect itself from predators by mimicking the appearance of a harmful species a predator is less likely to attack the species due to its awareness of the signal of warning color patterns batesian mimicry occurs in multiple vertebrates but is less prevalent in mammals due to a relative rarity of well marked harmful models however this form of mimicry is prevalent in snakes and frogs where chemical defense has coevolved

it has been found by yeast two hybrid screen to bind to setdb1 a histone protein methyltranferase enzyme setdb1 has been implicated in huntington s disease a neurodegenerative disorder c11orf1 is a nuclear protein with unknown function but has been shown to show preferential expression in some disease states in microarray data c11orf1 shows conservation through mammals and orthologs can be found in sea squirts and sea anemone the below table shows some orthologs found using blast c11orf1 is located on chromosome 11 and is neighbored by this protein is part of the upf0686 superfamily this family is characterized by the presence of a domain of unknown function duf 1143 shared by the family this family duf1143 has a domain that includes almost all 149 of the 150 amino acids in the human ortholog c11orf1 has six spicesomal variants and one unspliced variant the following properties of c11orf1 were predicted using bioinformatic analysis c11orf1 appears to be ubiquitously expressed at low levels but particularly high expression in the parathyroid expression data indicate expression in most tissues this gene has also been found in one experiment to be under expressed in huntington s disease patients while setdb1 is over expressed the

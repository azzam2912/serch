this protein is an adhesive glycoprotein that mediates cell to cell and cell to matrix interactions this protein can bind to fibrinogen fibronectin laminin type v collagen and integrins alpha v beta 1 this protein has been shown to play roles in platelet aggregation angiogenesis and tumorigenesis the thrombospondin 1 protein is a member of the thrombospondin family it is a multi domain matrix glycoprotein that has been shown to be a natural inhibitor of neovascularization and tumorigenesis in healthy tissue both positive and negative modulation of endothelial cell adhesion motility and growth have been attributed to tsp1 this should not be surprising considering that tsp1 interacts with at least 12 cell adhesion receptors including cd36 v integrins 1 integrins syndecan and integrin associated protein iap or cd47 it also interacts with numerous proteases involved in angiogenesis including plasminogen urokinase matrix metalloproteinase thrombin cathepsin and elastase thrombospondin 1 binds to the reelin receptors apoer2 and vldlr thereby affecting neuronal migration in the rostral migratory stream the various functions of the tsrs have been attributed to several recognition motifs characterization of these motifs has led to the use of recombinant proteins that contain these motifs these recombinant proteins are deemed useful

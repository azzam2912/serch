two common figures with equichordal points are the circle and the lima on it is impossible for a curve to have more than one equichordal point a curve is called equichordal when it has an equichordal point such a curve may be constructed as the pedal curve of a curve of constant width for instance the pedal curve of a circle is either another circle when the center of the circle is the pedal point or a lima on both are equichordal curves in 1916 fujiwara proposed the question of whether a curve could have two equichordal points offering in the same paper a proof that three or more is impossible independently a year later blaschke rothe and weitzenb ck posed the same question the problem remained unsolved until it was finally proven impossible in 1996 by marek rychlik despite its elementary formulation the equichordal point problem was difficult to solve rychlik s theorem is proved by methods of advanced complex analysis and algebraic geometry and it is 72 pages long

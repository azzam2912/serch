it is one isomer of six with this formula 2 5 diaminotoluene is a colorless crystalline solid although commercial samples are often colored owing to air oxidation it is commonly used in hair coloring 2 5 diaminotoluene is prepared through electrolytic reduction of 2 5 dinitrotoluene other methods include the reductive cleavage of 4 amino 2 3 dimethylazobenzene as well as the condensation of 2 amino 1 methylbenzene and toluene 4 sulphonyl chloride to produce 4 toluenesulphono 2 toluidide which is then coupled with diazotized aminobenzenesulphonic acid and reduced 2 5 diaminotoluene is a substitute for phenylenediamine 1 4 diaminobenzene in commercial hair dyes it is preferred because of its lower toxicity however many home hair dyes still use phenylenediamine in these applications these diamines function as a primary intermediate which means that it is first oxidized with hydrogen peroxide and then combined with a coupler to form the hair dye 2 5 diaminotoluene is commonly used to produce black drab and warm browns and shades of blonde and gray hair dyes 2 5 diaminotoluene is also known to be used in the production of dyes for textiles furs leathers biological stains and indicators wood stains and pigments two examples

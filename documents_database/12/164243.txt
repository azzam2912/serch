they were discovered in the 1960s by the japanese molecular biologists reiji and tsuneko okazaki along with the help of some of their colleagues during dna replication the double helix is unwound and the complementary strands are separated by the enzyme dna helicase creating what is known as the dna replication fork following this fork dna primase and then dna polymerase begin to act in order to create a new complementary strand because these enzymes can only work in the 5 to 3 direction the two unwound template strands are replicated in different ways one strand the leading strand undergoes a continuous replication process since its template strand has 3 to 5 directionality allowing the polymerase assembling the leading strand to follow the replication fork without interruption the lagging strand however cannot be created in a continuous fashion because its template strand has 5 to 3 directionality which means the polymerase must work backwards from the replication fork this causes periodic breaks in the process of creating the lagging strand the primase and polymerase move in the opposite direction of the fork so the enzymes must repeatedly stop and start again while the dna helicase breaks the strands apart once

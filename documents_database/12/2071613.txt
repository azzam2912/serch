feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning and is both difficult and expensive the need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning feature engineering is an informal topic but it is considered essential in applied machine learning a feature is an attribute or property shared by all of the independent units on which analysis or prediction is to be done any attribute could be a feature as long as it is useful to the model the purpose of a feature other than being an attribute would be much easier to understand in the context of a problem a feature is a characteristic that might help when solving the problem features are important to predictive models and influence results you could say the better the features are the better the result is this isn t entirely true because the results achieved also depend on the model and the data not just the chosen features that said choosing the right features is still very important better features can produce simpler and more flexible models and they often yield better results the feature engineering process is a feature could be strongly relevant i e the feature

it can also be formed geometrically by gluing together n 3 1 triangular prisms on their triangular faces this graph and graphs closely related to it have been frequently used in graph drawing to prove lower bounds on the area requirements of various styles of drawings the nested triangles graph with two triangles is the graph of the triangular prism and the nested triangles graph with three triangles is the graph of the triangular bifrustum more generally because the nested triangles graphs are planar and 3 vertex connected it follows from steinitz s theorem that they all can be represented as convex polyhedra an alternative geometric representation of these graphs may be given by gluing triangular prisms end to end on their triangular faces the number of nested triangles is one more than the number of glued prisms however using right prisms this gluing process will cause the rectangular faces of adjacent prisms to be coplanar so the result will not be strictly convex the nested triangles graph was named by who used it to show that drawing an n vertex planar graph in the integer lattice with straight line segment edges may require a bounding box of size at

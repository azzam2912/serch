let g be a finite group and let char g denote the subring of the ring of complex valued class functions of g consisting of integer combinations of irreducible characters char g is known as the character ring of g and its elements are known as virtual characters alternatively as generalized characters or sometimes difference characters it is a ring by virtue of the fact that the product of characters of g is again a character of g its multiplication is given by the elementwise product of class functions brauer s induction theorem shows that the character ring can be generated as an abelian group by induced characters of the form formula 1 where h ranges over subgroups of g and ranges over linear characters having degree 1 of h in fact brauer showed that the subgroups h could be chosen from a very restricted collection now called brauer elementary subgroups these are direct products of cyclic groups and groups whose order is a power of a prime using frobenius reciprocity brauer s induction theorem leads easily to his fundamental characterization of characters which asserts that a complex valued class function of g is a virtual character if and only

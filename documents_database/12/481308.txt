devil s gardens are immediately recognizable because the dominance of a single tree species is dramatically different from the biodiversity of the forest as a whole devil s gardens got their name because locals believed that an evil forest spirit chullachaki meaning uneven foot single foot in kichwa lived in them the ant myrmelachista schumanni creates devil s gardens by systematically poisoning all plants in the vicinity except d hirsuta the tree in which it nests the ant poisons the plants by injecting formic acid into the base of the leaf by killing other plants the ant promotes the growth and reproduction of d hirsuta which has hollow stems that provide nest sites for the ants a single ant colony might have more than 3 million workers and 15 000 queens and may persist for more than 800 years although the ants fend off herbivores the size of the garden is restricted by leaf destruction increasing as it expands as the ants are unable to defend the trees beyond a certain point

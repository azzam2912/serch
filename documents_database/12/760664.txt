instruction b has three different symbol possibilities none 0 1 each possibility is followed by a sequence of actions until we arrive at the rightmost column where the final m configuration is b as observed by a number of commentators including turing 1937 himself e g post 1936 post 1947 kleene 1952 wang 1954 the turing instructions are not atomic further simplifications of the model can be made without reducing its computational power see more at post turing machine as stated in the article turing machine turing proposed that his table be further atomized by allowing only a single print erase followed by a single tape movement l r n he gives us this example of the first little table converted undecidable p 127 turing s statement still implies five atomic operations at a given instruction m configuration the machine because a turing machine s actions are not atomic a simulation of the machine must atomize each 5 tuple into a sequence of simpler actions one possibility used in the following examples of behaviors of his machine is as follows so called canonical finite state machines do the symbol tests in parallel see more at microprogramming in the following example

the advantages of off axis illumination can be explained in the context where the pattern on the photomask is a diffraction grating with a small pitch the light that strikes the grating is diffracted in various directions if the incident light is at a normal angle along the axis of the optical system then the zero th diffracted order continues to be along the optical system axis while the other orders are diffracted sideways with the amount of deviation increasing as the pitch of the grating is decreasing for sufficiently small pitch only the zero th diffraction order manages to make it through the projection lens with the other orders being lost the result is that no pattern is created on the wafer since the zero th diffraction order only contains the average of the photomask pattern by making the illumination off axis all the diffraction orders are tilted which makes it more likely that the higher diffraction orders can make it through the projection lens and help form the image of the mask onto the wafer

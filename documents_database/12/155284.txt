multiplication by one half is equivalent to division by two or halving conversely division by one half is equivalent to multiplication by two or doubling one half appears often in mathematical equations recipes measurements etc half can also be said to be one part of something divided into two equal parts for instance the area s of a triangle is computed one half also figures in the formula for calculating figurate numbers such as triangular numbers and pentagonal numbers formula 1 and in the formula for computing magic constants for magic squares formula 2 the riemann hypothesis states that every nontrivial complex root of the riemann zeta function has a real part equal to one half has two different decimal expansions the familiar 0 5 and the recurring 0 49999999 it has a similar pair of expansions in any even base it is a common trap to believe these expressions represent distinct numbers see the proof that 0 999 equals 1 for detailed discussion of a related case in odd bases one half has no terminating representation only a single representation with a repeating fractional component such as 0 11111111 in ternary is also one of the few fractions to

it is a standard tool in integral geometry and has applications in isoperimetric and rigidity results the formula is named after luis santal who first proved the result in 1952 let formula 1 be a compact oriented riemannian manifold with boundary then for a function formula 2 santal s formula takes the form where under the assumptions that santal s formula is valid for all formula 21 in this case it is equivalent to the following identity of measures where formula 23 and formula 24 is defined by formula 25 in particular this implies that the geodesic x ray transform formula 26 extends to a bounded linear map formula 27 where formula 28 and thus there is the following formula 29 version of santal s formula if the non trapping or the convexity condition from above fail then there is a set formula 31 of positive measure such that the geodesics emerging from formula 32 either fail to hit the boundary of formula 33 or hit it non transversely in this case santal s formula only remains true for functions with support disjoint from this exceptional set formula 32 the following proof is taken from lemma 3 3 adapted to

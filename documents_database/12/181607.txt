an escapement part of every mechanical clock is the mechanism that gives the clock s pendulum periodic pushes to keep it swinging and each swing releases the clock s gears to move forward by a fixed amount thus moving the hands forward at a steady rate the grasshopper escapement was used in a few regulator clocks built during harrison s time and a few others over the years but has never seen wide use the term grasshopper in this connection apparently from the kicking action of the pallets first appears in the horological journal in the late 19th century john harrison used the grasshopper escapement in his regulator clocks and also for the first three of his marine timekeepers h1 h3 determining longitudinal position was a major problem in marine navigation newton argued that astronomical positioning could be used but an easier theoretical possibility was to use accurate knowledge of the time at a specific base location the difference in time between local time which was easy to measure and the time at base gives the difference in longitude between the base and the ship since 24 hours of time is equivalent to 360 degrees of longitude a large prize

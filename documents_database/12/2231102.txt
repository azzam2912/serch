these intrusions cause linear opening through the habitat or breakage in landscape connectivity due to infrastructure creation and maintenance which is known to have multiple ecological effects in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems these effects include habitat loss and fragmentation spread of invasive alien species desiccation windthrow fires animal injury and mortality e g roadkill changes in animal behaviour pollution microclimate and vegetation changes loss of ecosystem services increased pressures from development tourism hunting garbage disposal and associated human disturbances these intrusions considered crucial infrastructure for economic sectors such as transportation power and irrigation may also have negative social impacts on indigenous and rural people through exposure to novel social and market pressures loss of land and displacement and iniquitous distribution of costs and benefits from infrastructure projects the study of the ecological effects of linear infrastructure intrusions has spawning sub fields of research such as road ecology and railroad ecology establishment and maintenance of roads and highways causes direct loss of habitat because it involves clearing of trees and other vegetation cutting and dumping of soil and excavated materials movement of heavy vehicles and earth movers and establishment of worker settlements besides immediate effects of these disturbances roads and other

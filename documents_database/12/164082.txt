this information reveals the affinity between the two molecules and allows prediction of the amount bound given any set of initial conditions in order to measure a binding constant one must find a way to measure the amount of complex formed over a range of starting concentrations this can be achieved by labeling one of the species with a fluorescent or in this case a radioactive tag the dna is labeled by the addition of radioactive phosphate derived from adenosine triphosphate a filter binding assay is a simple way to quickly study many samples it measures affinities between two molecules often protein and dna using a filter the filter is constructed of nitrocellulose paper which is negatively charged since most proteins have a net positive charge nitrocellulose paper is ideal for immobilizing proteins dna is negatively charged due to the phosphate backbone and will not stick to the nitrocellulose on its own however any dna that has been bound by protein will stick the exact amount of dna stuck to the nitrocellulose is quantified by measuring the amount of radioactivity on the filter using a scintillation counter protein and dna are mixed in a series of microfuge tubes in which

trim proteins primarily function as ubiquitin ligases that regulate the innate response to infection trim25 localizes to the cytoplasm the presence of potential dna binding and dimerization transactivation domains suggests that this protein may act as a transcription factor similar to several other members of the trim family expression of the gene is upregulated in response to estrogen and it is thought to mediate estrogen actions in breast cancer as a primary response gene trim25 has an n terminal ring domain followed by a b box type 1 domain a b box type 2 domain a coiled coil domain ccd and a c terminal spry domain the ring domain coordinates two zinc atoms and is essential for recruiting ubiquitin conjugating enzymes the function of the b box domains is unknown the ccd domain has been implicated in multimerization and other protein protein interactions the spry domain is required for substrate recruitment the nmr chemical shifts for backbone of the pryspry domain of trim25 is assigned based on triple resonance experiments using uniformly isotopic labeled protein and the secondary structure of the domain pryspry domain of trim25 predicted based on the nmr assignments trim25 plays a key role in the rig

it may form tufts or a thin purple turf up to 5 millimetres high the filaments branch infrequently usually at the tips in most species of rhodochorton the spore does not persist in the mature plant instead a basal web of filaments acts as a holdfast indeed all rhodochorton species have distinct basal threads usually forming a disc and upright threads which are typically thinner lateral branches usually occur at or near the top of the patent cell and branching is concentrated towards the tips of threads the organism may encrust bare rock surfaces or be epiphytic upon frondose algae particularly laminaria hyperborea it typically grows in the shadow of these larger algae in the intertidal zone and its adaption to low light levels means it is also common in caves it reproduces in winter using tetrasporangia and don t bear any monosporangia rhodochorton is typically marine but r investiens dwells in fresh water sexual reproduction has never been observed it suffers grazing pressure from gastropods and amphipods but amazingly fragments of the algae are able to pass through the grazers digestive tracts alive grazing may actually form a mode of dispersal for the organism rhodochorton investiens displays a relatively

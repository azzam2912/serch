in this regard clitic doubling for objects can be viewed as a species of differential object marking spanish is one well known example of a clitic doubling language having clitic doubling for both direct and indirect objects because standard spanish grammatical structure does not draw a clear distinction between an indirect object and a direct object referring to a person or another animate entity see spanish prepositions it is common but not compulsory to use clitic doubling to clarify compare in such constructions the indirect object can be expressed both as a full noun phrase and as a clitic in order to note that the noun phrase beginning with a to should be understood as an indirect object the above if literally translated into english would be redundant this usage is highly preferred for many verbs but for some verbs it is not compulsory and it would also be valid to say siempre ofrezco caf a mis invitados without clitic doubling similarly the direct object may also be doubled with both the direct object pronoun and the full noun phrase but this is not as common as indirect clitic doubling and is usually influenced by definiteness animacy and specificity one

labeled with the isotope fluorine 18 it is used as a radioligand in positron emission tomography pet studies of the brain i e studies of the 5 ht neuroreceptors besides human neuroimaging studies altanserin has also been used in the study of rats an alternative for pet imaging the 5 ht receptor is the c volinanserin mdl 100 907 radioligand f altanserin and h volinanserin have shown very comparable binding both altanserin and mdl 100 907 are 5 ht receptor antagonists f setoperone can also be used in pet an alternative spect radioligand is the i 5 i r91150 receptor antagonist a rapid chemical synthesis of fluorine 18 and h 2 dual labeled altanserin has been described other ligands for other parts of the serotonin system used in pet studies are e g dasb ketanserin and way 100635 altanserin is probably not used in clinical routine however there have been performed several research based neuroimaging studies with the compound in humans since the 1990s some of these studies have considered methodogical issues such as the reproducibility of the method or whether to use constant infusion or bolus infusion delivery of altanserin other studies have compared altanserin binding to subject variables

it occurs in masses within the third geologic unit of the kuroko type deposits within the mine as a copper iron sulfide it is placed in the same group as bornite and chalcopyrite and most fukuchilite locations are found in relatively close proximity to these minerals fukuchilite was found to have a reflection color very similar to bornite and bright pinkish brown in air while being a purplish brown in oil also it was found to have a reactivity lower than pyrite but distinctly higher than bornite it has a mohs hardness of 4 6 a specific gravity of 4 9 and a sub metallic luster composed of 11 1 iron 37 9 copper and 51 00 of sulfur it is in the isotropic cubic crystal system with symmetry 2 m space group p a3 much relating to the structure of the mineral is still under debate and some believe that fukuchilite might actually be a form of villamaninite cu ni co fe s but fukuchilite currently still holds its mineral status as there is currently not enough evidence to discredit an already accepted and titled mineral

the curve set is named after mathematician harold m edwards elliptic curves are important in public key cryptography and twisted edwards curves are at the heart of an electronic signature scheme called eddsa that offers high performance while avoiding security problems that have surfaced in other digital signature schemes each twisted edwards curve is a twist of an edwards curve a twisted edwards curve formula 1 over a field formula 2 which have formula 3 is an affine plane curve defined by the equation formula 4 where formula 5 are distinct non zero elements of formula 2 the special case formula 7 is untwisted because the curve reduces to an ordinary edwards curve every twisted edwards curve is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve in montgomery form and vice versa as for all elliptic curves also for the twisted edwards curve it is possible to do some operations between its points such as adding two of them or doubling or tripling one the results of these operations are always points that belong to the curve itself in the following sections some formulas are given to obtain the coordinates of a point resulted from an addition between two other points addition

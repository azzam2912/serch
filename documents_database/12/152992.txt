this is not the same as the electrical efficiency see efficiency vs sensitivity the sensitivity of a hydrophone is usually expressed as db re 1 v pa sensitivity in a receiver is normally defined as the minimum input signal formula 1 required to produce a specified signal to noise s n ratio at the output port of the receiver and is defined as the mean noise power at the input port of the receiver times the minimum required signal to noise ratio at the output of the receiver where because receiver sensitivity indicates how faint an input signal can be to be successfully received by the receiver the lower power level the better lower power for a given s n ratio means better sensitivity since the receiver s contribution is smaller when the power is expressed in dbm the larger the absolute value of the negative number the better the receive sensitivity for example a receiver sensitivity of 98 dbm is better than a receive sensitivity of 95 dbm by 3 db or a factor of two in other words at a specified data rate a receiver with a 98 dbm sensitivity can hear signals that are half the power

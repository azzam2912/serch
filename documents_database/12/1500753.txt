it is an instance of a scheme for numbering permutations and is an example of an inversion table the lehmer code is named in reference to derrick henry lehmer but the code had been known since 1888 at least the lehmer code makes use of the fact that there are permutations of a sequence of n numbers if a permutation is specified by the sequence of its images of 1 n then it is encoded by a sequence of n numbers but not all such sequences are valid since every number must be used only once by contrast the encodings considered here choose the first number from a set of n values the next number from a fixed set of values and so forth decreasing the number of possibilities until the last number for which only a single fixed value is allowed every sequence of numbers chosen from these sets encodes a single permutation while several encodings can be defined the lehmer code has several additional useful properties it is the sequence in other words the term l counts the number of terms in to the right of that are smaller than it a number between 0 and allowing for

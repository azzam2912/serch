it is frequently denoted and corresponds to the gauge symmetry u 1 it is conserved only terms that are overall weak hypercharge neutral are allowed in the lagrangian however one of the interactions is with the higgs field since the higgs field vacuum expectation value is nonzero particles interact with this field all the time even in vacuum this changes their weak hypercharge and weak isospin only a specific combination of them electric charge is conserved mathematically weak hypercharge appears similar to the gell mann nishijima formula for the hypercharge of strong interactions which is not conserved in weak interactions and is zero for leptons weak hypercharge is the generator of the u 1 component of the electroweak gauge group and its associated quantum field b mixes with the w electroweak quantum field to produce the observed gauge boson and the photon of quantum electrodynamics the weak hypercharge satisfies the relation where is the electric charge in elementary charge units and is the third component of weak isospin the su 2 component rearranging the weak hypercharge can be explicitly defined as where left and right handed here are left and right chirality respectively distinct from helicity hypercharge assignments in the

the protein is soluble and found in circulating blood and the conceptually translated protein has four domains of interest these domains include a nidgen nido domain three fibronectin type iii fn3 domains several calcium binding egf like domains egf ca and one complement control protein ccp domain the gene is found on chromosome 2 locus q37 3 the mrna was isolated from the spleen and is 6834bp in length the conceptually translated protein is 1178aa long this protein is predicted to interact with somatostatin spermidine synthase and tmem132c sned1 is located on the plus strand of chromosome 2 at locus 2q37 3 the refseq identification number is nm 001080437 1 the genomic dna sequence of sned1 contains 96 729bp and the longest spliced mrna as predicted by aceview is 7048bp and contains 31 exons there are 9 splice variants of sned1 that exhibited protein structure matches using the phyre 2 database which is discussed under tertiary and quaternary structure sned1 is an acronym for sushi nidogen and egf like domains aliases for sned1 include snep sst3 and ire bp1 sned1 is very highly conserved throughout evolutionary history and is shown to exhibit this conservation across a wide range of taxa

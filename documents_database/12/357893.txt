the practitioners are known as lowfers lowfer operation is practiced in the united states and canada on radio frequencies between 160 khz and 190 khz which is sometimes referred to as the 1750 meter band and in the past as the 1875 meters band proposals have also been made for amateur radio operations at 136 khz with a number of u s hams holding experimental licenses authorized to conduct tests on that frequency u s and canadian radio operators who conduct low frequency experimental operations on the lowfer band are known as lowfers many lowfers are also licensed radio amateurs although an amateur radio license is not required for lowfer communications in those countries practical antennas at these frequencies are much shorter than the wavelength making it difficult to efficiently radiate much useful power by current u s and canadian regulations lowfer transmitters may not use antennas longer than 50 feet or final rf stage input powers that exceeds 1 watt telegraphy and digital modes are the most commonly used for communications but speech transmission via amplitude modulation am or single sideband modulation ssb is also allowed even with such short antennas and low transmit power lowfer stations have been

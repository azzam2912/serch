the polymerase chain reaction pcr was created and also patented during the 1980s vectorette pcr was first noted and described in an article in 1990 by riley and his team since then multiple variants of pcr have been created vectorette pcr focuses on amplifying a specific sequence obtained from an internal sequence that is originally known until the fragment end multiple researches have taken this method as an opportunity to conduct experiments in order to uncover the potential uses that can be derived from vectorette pcr vectorette pcr is similar to pcr with the difference being that it is capable of obtaining the sequence desired for amplification from an already known primer site while pcr needs information of already known sequences at both ends vectorette pcr only requires previous knowledge of one this means that is able to apply the method of pcr which needs sequence information from both ends to fragments of dna that contain the information of the sequence at only one end and not the other in order to achieve this there are specific steps that this method must first go through these steps have been researched for the purpose of discovering the scientific uses of vectorette

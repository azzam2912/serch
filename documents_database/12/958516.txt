chapman s basic requirements for the design were for a car of 1100 lbs powered by an 85 bhp engine and a maximum speed of 125 mph work began on this design in late 1953 and chapman was assisted in the design of the body by the aerodynamicist frank costin who was the brother of mike costin his main collaborator the spaceframe chassis for the mark viii has been described as the most nearly perfect sports car chassis this was lotus first true spaceframe and relied on the aircraft experience of peter ross and gilbert mcintosh extremely light the total weight of the frame alone was only 35 lbs and very stiff the frame consisted of only nineteen members and was fully triangulated however from a practical point of view the frame had limitations mostly regarding maintenance in order to install the engine it had to be disassembled and then reassembled inside the framework the spaceframe retained the divided front axle independent suspension that chapman had employed on his earlier cars and used a de dion layout with inboard brakes at the rear a modified mg 1500 cc engine and transmission were installed and a stressed undertray further stiffened the

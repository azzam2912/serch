bacteria serve as natural hosts with transmission achieved through passive diffusion there are currently three species in this genus including the type species enterobacteria phage lambda group dsdna lambdalikeviruses are nonenveloped with a head and tail the head is about 60 nm in diameter consisting of 72 capsomers t 7 levo all three species have been fully sequenced they range between 39k and 49k nucleotides with 57 to 73 proteins all three complete genomes as well as several similar but unclassified strains are available here the virus attaches to the host cell s adhesion receptors using its terminal fiber and ejects the viral dna into the host cytoplasm via long flexible tail ejection system viral replication is cytoplasmic replication follows the replicative transposition model dna templated transcription is the method of transcription translation takes place by 1 ribosomal frameshifting and 1 ribosomal frameshifting once the viral genes have been replicated the procapsid is assembled and packed the tail is then assembled and the mature virions are released via lysis and holin endolysin spanin proteins bacteria serve as the natural host transmission routes are passive diffusion according to ictv s first report in 1971 the genus lambdalikevirus was first accepted under

the information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the kinematics and physical origin of the solar system and our galaxy the milky way the history of astrometry is linked to the history of star catalogues which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements this can be dated back to hipparchus who around 190 bc used the catalogue of his predecessors timocharis and aristillus to discover earth s precession in doing so he also developed the brightness scale still in use today hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions hipparchus s successor ptolemy included a catalogue of 1 022 stars in his work the almagest giving their location coordinates and brightness in the 10th century abd al rahman al sufi carried out observations on the stars and described their positions magnitudes and star color furthermore he provided drawings for each constellation which are depicted in his book of fixed stars ibn yunus observed more than 10 000 entries for the sun s position for many years using a large astrolabe with a diameter of nearly 1 4 metres his observations on eclipses were still used centuries later

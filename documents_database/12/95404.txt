the compulsator is used like a capacitor to gather energy from a low power source and store it then generate a high power output for a short period the windings of a compulsator are different from those of a normal alternator in being designed for minimal inductance this allows the current in the windings to change very rapidly which is why this compensation makes it better at delivering pulses the kinetic energy of a rotating object depends on the mass of the object the shape of the object and the square of the speed of rotation therefore compulsators tend to have very light rotors spinning very fast in order to store the most energy in the available mass and because too much mass in the rotor causes problems with the magnitude of centripetal force required to prevent the rotor from flying apart compulsators are popular choices for high end railgun power supplies one possibility being considered is to build an electric tank using a conventional diesel engine for propulsion and to charge a compulsator the compulsator would be used to power a railgun and potentially other pulsed energy weapons particularly electronic warfare systems also the compulsator could be used in

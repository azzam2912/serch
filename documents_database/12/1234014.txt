it is perhaps most easily thought of as an algebraic extension of multivariable polynomials an extension that permits exponents to be arbitrary real numbers rather than just non negative integers while requiring the independent variables to be strictly positive so that division by zero and other inappropriate algebraic operations are not encountered formally a signomial is a function with domain formula 1 which takes values where the coefficients formula 3 and the exponents formula 4 are real numbers signomials are closed under addition subtraction multiplication and scaling if we restrict all formula 5 to be positive then the function f is a posynomial consequently each signomial is either a posynomial the negative of a posynomial or the difference of two posynomials if in addition all exponents formula 4 are non negative integers then the signomial becomes a polynomial whose domain is the positive orthant for example is a signomial the term signomial was introduced by richard j duffin and elmor l peterson in their seminal joint work on general algebraic optimization published in the late 1960s and early 1970s a recent introductory exposition involves optimization problems nonlinear optimization problems with constraints and or objectives defined by signomials are harder to

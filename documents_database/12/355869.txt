while fe is highly abundant in the earth s crust it is less common in oxygenated surface waters iron is a key micronutrient in primary productivity and a limiting nutrient in high nutrient low chlorophyll hnlc regions of the ocean a critical component of the iron cycle is aeolian dust which is transported from the earth s land via the atmosphere to the ocean iron exists in a range of oxidation states from 2 to 7 however on earth it is predominantly in its 2 or 3 redox state the cycling of iron between its 2 and 3 oxidation states is referred to as the iron cycle this process can be entirely abiotic or facilitated by microorganisms some examples of this include the rusting of iron bearing metals in this case fe is abiotically oxidized to fe by oxygen and the abiotic reduction of fe to fe by iron sulfide minerals or the biological cycling of fe oxidizing microbes iron is an essential micro nutrient for almost every life form and is a primary redox active metal on earth due to the high reactivity of fe with oxygen and low solubility of fe iron is a limiting nutrient in most

however the model theory of hilog is first order although syntactically hilog strictly extends first order logic hilog can be embedded into this logic hilog was first described in 1989 it was later extended in the direction of many sorted logic the xsb system parses hilog syntax but the integration of hilog into xsb is only partial in particular hilog is not integrated with the xsb module system a full implementation of hilog is available in the flora 2 system it has been shown that hilog can be embedded into first order logic through a fairly simple transformation for instance codice 1 gets embedded as the following first order term codice 2 the framework for logic based dialects rif fld of the rule interchange format rif is largely based on the ideas underlying hilog and f logic in all the examples below capitalized symbols denote variables and the comma denotes logical conjunction as in most logic programming languages the first and the second examples show that variables can appear in predicate positions predicates can even be complex terms such as codice 3 or codice 4 below the third example shows that variables can also appear in place of atomic formulas

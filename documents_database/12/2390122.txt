it exists southeast of the grenville front and extends from labrador southwestern to lake huron it is bounded by the st lawrence river seaway to the southeast the grenville front separates the grenville province from the superior craton adjacent to the grenville front is the parautochthonous belt the parautochthonous belt is made of rocks originally derived from the superior craton which have been metamorphosed and reworked since their emplacement the rocks to the southwest of the parautochthonous belt are various accreted terranes that have been thrust upon or emplaced during the various tectonic events that have taken place from 2 0 0 98 billion years ago the compositions of these terranes are unique and have distinct depleted mantle model ages during the formation of the grenville province the type of tectonism changed the earliest stages of formation were dominated by arrested subduction the type of tectonism then changed to flat slab subduction in the late stages of formation the tectonism changed to collisional orogenesis although there has been many studies done on the grenville province the origins of the various terranes are still not fully understood and may never be fully known the central metasedimentary boundary thrust zone makes up

the wavelet is near symmetric their wavelet functions have formula 1 vanishing moments and scaling functions formula 2 and has been used in many applications using calder n zygmund operators some theorems about coiflets for a wavelet system formula 3 the following three equations are equivalent formula 4 and similar equivalence holds between formula 5 and formula 6 for a wavelet system formula 3 the following six equations are equivalent formula 8 and similar equivalence holds between formula 9 and formula 6 for a biorthogonal wavelet system formula 11 if either formula 12 or formula 13 possesses a degree l of vanishing moments then the following two equations are equivalent formula 14 for any formula 15 such that formula 16 both the scaling function low pass filter and the wavelet function high pass filter must be normalised by a factor formula 17 below are the coefficients for the scaling functions for c6 30 the wavelet coefficients are derived by reversing the order of the scaling function coefficients and then reversing the sign of every second one i e c6 wavelet 0 022140543057 0 102859456942 0 544281086116 1 205718913884 0 477859456942 0 102859456942 mathematically this looks like formula 18 where k

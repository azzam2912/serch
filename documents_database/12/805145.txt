his seminal work had a profound impact in numerous areas of mathematics and he is widely credited for introducing and popularizing modern notation and terminology euler introduced much of the mathematical notation in use today such as the notation f x to describe a function and the modern notation for the trigonometric functions he was the first to use the letter e for the base of the natural logarithm now also known as euler s number the use of the greek letter formula 1 to denote the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter was also popularized by euler although it did not originate with him he is also credited for inventing the notation i to denote formula 2 euler made important contributions to complex analysis he introduced the scientific notation he discovered what is now known as euler s formula that for any real number formula 3 the complex exponential function satisfies this has been called the most remarkable formula in mathematics by richard feynman euler s identity is a special case of this this identity is particularly remarkable as it involves e formula 1 i 1 and 0 arguably the five most important constants in mathematics

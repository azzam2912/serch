depending on context the same equation can be called the advection diffusion equation drift diffusion equation or generic scalar transport equation the general equation is where the right hand side of the equation is the sum of three contributions in a common situation the diffusion coefficient is constant there are no sources or sinks and the velocity field describes an incompressible flow i e it has zero divergence then the formula simplifies to in this form the convection diffusion equation combines both parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations in non interacting material e g bose einstein condensate has formula 3 and zero mass diffusivity hence the transport equation is simply formula 4 using fourier transform in time domain its general solution can be obtained formula 5 where formula 6 is any differentiable scalar function this is the time evolution of bose einstein condensate during time of flight measurement the stationary convection diffusion equation describes the steady state behavior of a convective diffusive system in a steady state so the formula is the convection diffusion equation can be derived in a straightforward way from the continuity equation which states that the rate of change for a scalar quantity in a differential

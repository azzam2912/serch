because the river grane itself does not deliver enough water for the 3 km long reservoir a 7 4 km long diversion channel was built from the oker river below the oker dam this also collects water from the gose on the way a further 4 8 km long diversion runs from the radau to the gro er romke and thus into the oker grane tunnel as well likewise there is a 4 6 km long tunnel to the innerste dam the operator of the grane dam as well as its associated diversion systems and waterworks is the harzwasserwerke the barrage is an earth dam with asphaltic concrete lining the grane reservoir granestausee supplies drinking water acts as flood protection water regulation and electricity generation the hydro electric power station has a power output of 180 kw the waterworks for drinking water lies higher up on the northern slope the water from the reservoir is pumped up into a compensating storage basin of 60 000 m capacity from where it flows to the waterworks the grane dam has an average annual discharge of 55 million m because the reservoir provides drinking water water sports are not allowed even motor traffic

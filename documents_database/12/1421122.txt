the basic concept is the reduction of multitudinous amounts of data down to the meaningful parts when information is derived from instrument readings there may also be a transformation from analog to digital form when the data are already in digital form the reduction of the data typically involves some editing scaling encoding sorting collating and producing tabular summaries when the observations are discrete but the underlying phenomenon is continuous then smoothing and interpolation are often needed often the data reduction is undertaken in the presence of reading or measurement errors some idea of the nature of these errors is needed before the most likely value may be determined an example in astronomy is the data reduction in the kepler satellite this satellite records 95 megapixel images once every six seconds generating tens of megabytes of data per second which is orders of magnitudes more than the downlink bandwidth of 550 kbps the on board data reduction encompasses co adding the raw frames for thirty minutes reducing the bandwidth by a factor of 300 furthermore interesting targets are pre selected and only the relevant pixels are processed which is 6 of the total this reduced data is then sent to

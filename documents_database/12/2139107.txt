it is important to differentiate between the alkaline waste generated in the bayer process and the tailings generated during the mining of bauxite this article specifically covers the alkaline waste generated when operating the bayer process the scale of production makes the waste product an important one and issues with its storage are reviewed and every opportunity is explored to find uses for it over 95 of the alumina produced globally is through the bayer process for every tonne of alumina produced approximately 1 to 1 5 tonnes of bauxite tailings residue are also produced annual production of alumina in 2018 was approximately 126 million tonnes resulting in the generation of over 160 million tonnes of bauxite tailings residue red mud or bauxite residue is a side product of the bayer process the principal means of refining bauxite en route to alumina the resulting alumina is the raw material for producing aluminium by the hall h roult process a typical bauxite plant produces one to two times as much red mud as alumina this ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process and the extraction conditions there are over 60 manufacturing operations across the world

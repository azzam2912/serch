it is defined by the interaction of mtor and the rapamycin insensitive companion of mtor rictor and also includes g l mammalian stress activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 msin1 as well as protor 1 2 deptor and tti1 and tel2 mtorc2 has been shown to function as an important regulator of the cytoskeleton through its stimulation of f actin stress fibers paxillin rhoa rac1 cdc42 and protein kinase c pkc mtorc2 also regulates cellular proliferation and metabolism in part through the regulation of igf ir insr akt pkb and the serum and glucocorticoid induced protein kinase sgk mtorc2 phosphorylates the serine threonine protein kinase akt pkb at a serine residue s473 as well as serine residue s450 phosphorylation of the serine stimulates akt phosphorylation at a threonine t308 residue by pdk1 and leads to full akt activation curcumin inhibits both by preventing phosphorylation of the serine moreover mtorc2 activity has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy macroautophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy in addition mtorc2 has tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylates igf ir and insulin receptor at the tyrosine residues y1131 1136 and y1146 1151 respectively leading to full activation of igf ir and insr mtorc2 appears to be

this protein was found to bind to the mutant huntingtin protein in proportion to the number of glutamines present in the glutamine repeat region huntington s disease hd a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons is caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the hd protein huntingtin this gene encodes a protein that interacts with huntingtin with two cytoskeletal proteins dynactin and pericentriolar autoantigen protein 1 and with a hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate hgs the interactions with cytoskeletal proteins and a kinase substrate suggest a role for this protein in vesicular trafficking or organelle transport huntingtin associated protein 1 has two subtypes hap1a and hap1b hap1 preferentially interacts with in a polyq dependent manner its localization and possible interacting partners other than htt have since been characterised thus elucidating a possible role for this protein in hd pathogenesis martin et al showed that hap1 is localized in mitotic spindle of dividing striatal cells and associated endosomes microtubules and vesicles in the basal forebrain and striatial neurons where hap1b is preferentially expressed furthermore page and colleagues identified hap1 mrna in the following forebrain limbic nuclei the amygdala nucleus accumbens dentate gyrus septal nuclei bed

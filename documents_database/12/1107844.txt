it repairs the naturally occurring mutagenic dna lesion o methylguanine back to guanine and prevents mismatch and errors during dna replication and transcription accordingly loss of mgmt increases the carcinogenic risk in mice after exposure to alkylating agents the two bacterial isozymes are ada and ogt although alkylating mutagens preferentially modify the guanine base at the n7 position o alkyl guanine is a major carcinogenic lesion in dna this dna adduct is removed by the repair protein o alkylguanine dna alkyltransferase through an s2 mechanism this protein is not a true enzyme since it removes the alkyl group from the lesion in a stoichiometric reaction and the active enzyme is not regenerated after it is alkylated referred to as a suicide enzyme the methyl acceptor residue in the protein is a cysteine formula 1 methylation of the gene s promoter may play a significant role in carcinogenesis in patients with glioblastoma a severe type of brain tumor the methylation state of the mgmt gene determined whether tumor cells would be responsive to temozolomide if the promoter was methylated temozolomide was more effective on a clinical level this translates into a prolonged survival of glioblastoma patients with a methylated mgmt promoter

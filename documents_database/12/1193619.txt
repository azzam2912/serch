vireos typically have dull greenish plumage hence the name from latin virere to be green but some are brown or gray on the back and some have bright yellow underparts they resemble wood warblers apart from their slightly larger size and heavier bills which in most species have a very small hook at the tip the legs are stout most species fall into two plumage groups one with wing bars and yellow or white eye rings and one with unmarked wings and eye stripes however the choc vireo has both wing bars and eye stripes sexes are alike in all species except for the black capped vireo in which the male s crown is black and the female s is gray the genus vireo was introduced in 1808 by the french ornithologist louis jean pierre vieillot the type species was subsequently designated as the white eyed vireo vireo griseus by the german ornithologist hans friedrich gadow in 1883 the word vireo was used by latin authors for a small green migratory bird probably a eurasian golden oriole but a european greenfinch has also been suggested all members of the genus mostly eat insects and other arthropods but also eat some

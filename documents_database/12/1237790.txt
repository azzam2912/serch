popular applications requiring rf matrices are ground systems test equipment and communication systems an rf matrix is used in test systems in both design verification and manufacturing test to route high frequency signals between the device under test dut and the test and measurement equipment in addition to signal routing the rf microwave switch matrix may also contain signal conditioning components including passive signal conditioning devices such as attenuators filters and directional couplers as well as active signal conditioning such as amplification and frequency converters since the signal routing and signal conditioning needs of a test system differ from design to design rf microwave switch matrices typically are custom designed by the test system engineer or by a hired contractor for each new test system the switch matrix is made up of rf switches and signal conditioners that are mounted together in a mechanical infrastructure or housing cables then interconnect the switches and signal conditioners the switch matrix then employs a driver circuit and power supply to power and drive the switches and signal conditioners the switch matrix uses connectors or fixtures to route the signal paths from the sourcing and measurement equipment to the dut the switch matrix is

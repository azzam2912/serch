an electron donating group edg or electron releasing group erg is an atom or functional group that donates some of its electron density into a conjugated system via resonance mesomerism or inductive effects or induction called m or i effects respectively thus making the system more nucleophilic as a result of these electronic effects an aromatic ring to which such a group is attached is more likely to participate in electrophilic substitution reaction edgs are therefore often known as activating groups though steric effects can interfere with the reaction an electron withdrawing group ewg i or m effects for inductive and resonance withdrawal respectively will have the opposite effect on the nucleophilicity of the ring the ewg removes electron density from a system making it less reactive in this type of reaction and therefore called deactivating groups edgs and ewgs also determine the positions relative to themselves on the aromatic ring where substitution reactions are most likely to take place this property is therefore important in processes of organic synthesis electron donating groups are generally ortho para directors for electrophilic aromatic substitutions while electron withdrawing groups are generally meta directors with the exception of the halogens which are also ortho

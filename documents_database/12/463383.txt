for example the unicode characters u 8aaa and u 8aac are z variants the notion of z variance is only applicable to the cjkv scripts chinese japanese korean and vietnamese and is a subtopic of han unification the unicode philosophy of code point allocation for cjk languages is organized along three axes the x axis represents differences in semantics for example the latin capital a u 0041 a and the greek capital alpha u 0391 are represented by two distinct code points in unicode and might be termed x variants though this term is not common the y axis represents significant differences in appearance though not in semantics for example the traditional chinese character m o cat u 8c93 and the simplified chinese character u 732b are y variants the z axis represents minor typographical differences for example the chinese characters u 838a and u 8358 are z variants as are u 8aaa and u 8aac the glossary at unicode org defines z variant as two cjk unified ideographs with identical semantics and unifiable shapes where unifiable is taken in the sense of han unification thus were han unification perfectly successful z variants would not exist they exist in unicode

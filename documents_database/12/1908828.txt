it is a member of the virgo cluster of galaxies and is located 4 3 from messier 87 the galactic plane of ngc 4535 is inclined by an angle of 43 to the line of sight from the earth the morphological classification of ngc 4535 in the de vaucouleurs system is sab s c which indicates a bar structure across the core sab no ring s and loosely wound spiral arms c the inner part of the galaxy has two spiral arms which branch into multiple arms further away the small nucleus is of type hii meaning the spectrum resembles that of an h ii region during 1999 the hubble space telescope was used to observe cepheid variable stars in ngc 4535 the period luminosity relationship for these objects yielded a distance modulus of 31 02 0 26 magnitude this corresponded to a physical distance estimate of 52 2 6 2 mly 16 0 1 9 mpc which was consistent with distance estimates for other members of the virgo cluster

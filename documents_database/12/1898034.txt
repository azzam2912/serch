its utx 32 4 3bsd berkeley unix based operating system was one of the very first multi processor shared memory implementations of unix although the processors operated in a master slave configuration with a mutual exclusion mutex lock on all kernel io resources machines could be configured for either single or dual processor operation the machine itself was housed in a number of 19 inch rack cabinets and the main cpus consisted of 18 boards of ecl logic the resulting system was capable of benchmark performances up to 20 mips a very high rating at the time the powernode systems were a very close relative of gould s real time computer systems running their proprietary mpx real time operating system only about two boards differed between the unix running powernode machines and the mpx running real time machines the most significant of these was the memory management board which had virtual memory mapping abilities in the unix variant but not in the real time variant a smaller model of the powernode was also available in the form of the gould powernode 6032 and 6040 systems which achieved a 7 mips performance similar to the contemporary dec vax 11 780 and

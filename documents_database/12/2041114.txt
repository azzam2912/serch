cvv is an enveloped arbovirus nominally 80 120 nm in diameter whose genome is composed of three single stranded negative sense rna segments the large segment of related bunyaviruses is approximately 6800 bases in length and encodes a probable viral polymerase the middle cvv segment has a 4463 nucleotide sequence and the smallest segment encodes for the nucleocapsid and a second non structural protein cvv has been known to cause outbreaks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformations in ruminants such as sheep and cattle cvv rarely infects humans but when they are infected it has caused encephalitis and multiorgan failure the cache valley virus genome is split into three parts the three parts are called the small medium and large segments based on the number of bases the large segment encodes the l protein which is the rna dependent rna polymerase the small segment utilizes an open reading frame with alternative initiation sites to encode two proteins depending on the initiation site it can either code for the protein that makes up the nucleocapsid n or a non structural protein nss the medium segment encodes 2 type 1 integral transmembrane glycoproteins gn and gc as well as a non structural

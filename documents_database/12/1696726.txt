as hard point light sources however leds have several significant limitations in edge lit digital displays first the light generated by leds must be spread evenly to all parts of the display by a light guide typically a plate of poly methyl methacrylate which transports light by total internal reflection tir extraction patterns on the surface of the light guide meter out the light and generate a uniform brightness distribution even with a light guide dark zones can be noticeable along the injection edge closest to the leds the existence of these dark zones requires that the injection edge be shielded by a border or bezel the necessity of incorporating a bezel limits design options and the space available for displaying information dark zones also influence the spacing between leds which is typically between about 9 mm and 11 mm placing leds farther apart creates more pronounced dark zones this in turn limits the ability of designers to reduce the number of leds in a display despite the cost advantages and increased energy efficiency of such a reduction furthermore the poor light mixing of current light guides makes digital displays highly sensitive to variations in led color and brightness closely

the ragulator rag complex is composed of five lamtor subunits which work to regulate mapk and mtor complex 1 the lamtor subunits form a molecule with rag gtpase and v atpase which sits on the cell s lysosomes and detects the availability of amino acids if the ragulator complex receives signals for low amino acid count it will start the process of catabolizing the cell if there is an abundance of amino acids available to the cell the ragulator complex will signal that the cell can continue to grow ragulator proteins come in two different forms rag a rag b and rag c rag d these interact to form heterodimers with one another mtorc1 is a complex within the lysosome membrane that initiates growth when promoted by a stimulus such as growth factors a gtpase is a key component in cell signaling and there were in 2010 four rag complexes discovered within the lysosomes of cells in 2008 it was thought that these rag complexes would slow down autophagy and activate cell growth by interacting with mtorc1 however in 2010 the ragulator was discovered researchers determined that the function of this ragulator was to interact with the rag a b

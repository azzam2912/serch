waxcap grasslands occur principally in europe where they are declining as a result of agricultural practices the fungal species are consequently of conservation concern and efforts have been made in the united kingdom and elsewhere to protect both the grasslands and their characteristic fungi the association of waxcaps with unimproved nutrient poor grasslands was first noted in 1949 in the netherlands but current interest was stimulated by a series of papers published by dutch mycologist eef arnolds in the 1980s arnolds not only confirmed the association of waxcaps with unimproved grasslands but also noted the rapid decline in such habitats in the netherlands similar studies were subsequently undertaken elsewhere in europe initially in denmark and the united kingdom waxcap grasslands are characterized by being unimproved unfertilized and nutrient poor short sward through grazing or mowing moss rich and long established not recently sown they occur in both upland and lowland areas and may be on acidic neutral or calcareous soil they support a wide range of characteristic larger fungi but may not be equally species rich in plants larger fungi characteristic of waxcap grasslands include agarics belonging to the genera hygrocybe waxcaps entoloma pinkgills dermoloma porpoloma and camarophyllopsis clavarioid fungi

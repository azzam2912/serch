this controversial theory is an alternative to the more widely accepted docking theory of olfaction formerly termed the shape theory of olfaction which proposes that a molecule s smell character is due to a range of weak non covalent interactions between its protein odorant receptor found in the nasal epithelium such as electrostatic and van der waals interactions as well as h bonding dipole attraction pi stacking metal ion cation pi interaction and hydrophobic effects in addition to the molecule s conformation the current vibration theory has recently been called the swipe card model in contrast with lock and key models based on shape theory as proposed by luca turin the odorant molecule must first fit in the receptor s binding site then it must have a vibrational energy mode compatible with the difference in energies between two energy levels on the receptor so electrons can travel through the molecule via inelastic electron tunneling triggering the signal transduction pathway the vibration theory is discussed in a popular but controversial book by chandler burr the odor character is encoded in the ratio of activities of receptors tuned to different vibration frequencies in the same way that color is encoded in the

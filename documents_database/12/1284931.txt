better ways to prevent osteoporotic fractures are needed current fracture predictions are based on historical fracture patient data sets to identify key factors which contribute to the increased probability of an osteoporotic fracture this approach oversimplifies the mechanisms leading to an osteoporotic fracture and fail to take into account numerous hierarchical factors which are unique to the individual these factors span cell level to body level functions musculoskeletal anatomy and neuromotor control define the daily loading spectrum including paraphysiological overloading events fracture events occur at organ level and are influenced by the elasticity and geometry of bone bone elasticity and geometry are determined by tissue morphology cell activity changes tissue morphology and composition over time constituents of the extracellular matrix are the prime determinants of tissue strength accuracy could be dramatically improved if a more deterministic approach was used which accounts for those factors and their variation between individuals by creating a patient specific hypermodel a model composed by many sub models each describing the relevant phenomena taking place at one of the many dimensional scales involved this incredibly complex problem may be solved vphop will realize p2 medicine for osteoporosis patients predictive multiscale models representing skeletal mechanobiology from the

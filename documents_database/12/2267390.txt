the chart is called a cascade chart because the scatter of data points and downward curvature resembles a waterfall or cascade this name was first introduced by dr alberto w mello in his work reliability prediction for structures under cyclic loads and recurring inspections materials subject to cyclic loads as shown in the graph on the right may form and propagate cracks over time due to fatigue therefore it is essential to determine a reliable inspection interval there are numerous factors that must be considered to determine this inspection interval the non destructive inspection ndi technique must have a high probability of detecting a crack in the material if missed a crack may lead the structure to a catastrophic failure before the next inspection on the other hand the inspection interval cannot be too frequent that the structure s maintenance is no longer profitable ndi is a process used to examine materials without causing damage to the structure the main purpose of using ndi techniques is to comb the surface of a material for small cracks that could affect the integrity of the entire structure because the structure is intended to be used again it is essential that the methods

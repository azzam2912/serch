during the first barbary war the american frigate was captured by the barbary pirates when it ran aground in the city of tripoli on the southern shores of the mediterranean sea during the course of the naval blockade of the harbor there were numerous engagements the most intense being the gunboat battle of august 3 1804 during the battle lieutenant stephen decatur boarded a tripolitan gunboat that he believed was crewed by the men who had mortally wounded his brother after supposedly surrendering while lieutenant decatur was locked in hand to hand combat with the tripolitan commander another tripolitan sailor swung his saber at him according to early accepted accounts reuben james interposed himself between the descending sword and his commander taking the blow on his head the blow did not kill him and he recovered later to continue serving in the navy this account though is now considered to be in error no one by the name of james is recorded as having received medical treatment after the battle another of decatur s crewmen daniel frazier did receive medical treatment for a serious saber slash to the head this supports some initial accounts that it was frazier not james

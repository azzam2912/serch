its antiparticle is the meson composed of a bottom quark and a strange antiquark strange b mesons are noted for their ability to oscillate between matter and antimatter via a box diagram with measured by cdf experiment at fermilab that is a meson composed of a bottom quark and strange antiquark the strange meson can spontaneously change into an bottom antiquark and strange quark pair the strange meson and vice versa on 25 september 2006 fermilab announced that they had claimed discovery of previously only theorized b meson oscillation according to fermilab s press release ronald kotulak writing for the chicago tribune called the particle bizarre and stated that the meson may open the door to a new era of physics with its proven interactions with the spooky realm of antimatter better understanding of the meson is one of the main objectives of the lhcb experiment conducted at the large hadron collider on 24 april 2013 cern physicists in the lhcb collaboration announced that they had observed cp violation in the decay of strange mesons for the first time scientists found the b meson decaying into two muons for the first time with large hadron collider experiments casting doubt on

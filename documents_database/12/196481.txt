this result had been conjectured by and it is sometimes called the weak perfect graph theorem to distinguish it from the strong perfect graph theorem characterizing perfect graphs by their forbidden induced subgraphs a perfect graph is an undirected graph with the property that in every one of its induced subgraphs the size of the largest clique equals the minimum number of colors in a coloring of the subgraph perfect graphs include many important graphs classes including bipartite graphs chordal graphs and comparability graphs the complement of a graph has an edge between two vertices if and only if the original graph does not have an edge between the same two vertices thus a clique in the original graph becomes an independent set in the complement and a coloring of the original graph becomes a clique cover of the complement the perfect graph theorem states equivalently in a perfect graph the size of the maximum independent set equals the minimum number of cliques in a clique cover let g be a cycle graph of odd length greater than three a so called odd hole then g requires at least three colors in any coloring but has no triangle so it

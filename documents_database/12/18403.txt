many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket the term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis coaxial cable was invented by english physicist engineer and mathematician oliver heaviside who patented the design in 1880 coaxial cable is a type of transmission line used to carry high frequency electrical signals with low losses it is used in such applications as telephone trunklines broadband internet networking cables high speed computer data busses carrying cable television signals and connecting radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas it differs from other shielded cables because the dimensions of the cable and connectors are controlled to give a precise constant conductor spacing which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line coaxial cable is used as a transmission line for radio frequency signals its applications include feedlines connecting radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas computer network e g ethernet connections digital audio s pdif and distribution of cable television signals one advantage of coaxial over other types of radio transmission line is that in an ideal coaxial cable the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists only in the space between the

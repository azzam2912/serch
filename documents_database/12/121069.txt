it is not one specific shape but a statistical distribution of shapes for all the chains in a population of macromolecules the conformation s name is derived from the idea that in the absence of specific stabilizing interactions a polymer backbone will sample all possible conformations randomly many linear unbranched homopolymers in solution or above their melting temperatures assume approximate random coils even copolymers with monomers of unequal length will distribute in random coils if the subunits lack any specific interactions the parts of branched polymers may also assume random coils below their melting temperatures most thermoplastic polymers polyethylene nylon etc have amorphous regions in which the chains approximate random coils alternating with regions that are crystalline the amorphous regions contribute elasticity and the crystalline regions contribute strength and rigidity more complex polymers such as proteins with various interacting chemical groups attached to their backbones self assemble into well defined structures but segments of proteins and polypeptides that lack secondary structure are often assumed to exhibit a random coil conformation in which the only fixed relationship is the joining of adjacent amino acid residues by a peptide bond this is not actually the case since the ensemble will be energy

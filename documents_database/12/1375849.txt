the wave impact induces rotation of gyroscopes located inside a pear shaped duck and an electrical generator converts this rotation into electricity with an overall efficiency of up to 90 the salter s duck was invented by stephen salter in response to the oil shortage in the 1970s and was one of the earliest generator designs proposed to the wave energy programme in the united kingdom the funding for the project was cut off in the early 1980s after oil prices rebounded and the uk government moved away from alternative energy sources as of may 2018 no wave power devices have ever gone into large scale production as a result of the 1973 oil crisis salter set about creating a source of alternative energy the idea for creating salter s duck came about from his studies on a lavatory cistern while at the university of edinburgh he invented salter s duck in 1974 and attempted to make it the main device of choice for the wave energy programme in the united kingdom a prototype attempt to use the device was constructed in 1976 off dores beach it was to be used to provide some 20 kw of power it was

it is under investigation as a viable alternative to conventional photovoltaic cells lonnie johnson invented it and claims the converter exhibits an energy conversion efficiency of as much as 60 compared to the 30 efficiency typical of the best photovoltaic cells however this claim is at a theoretical level based on comparison with a carnot cycle and assumes a temperature gradient of 600 c it was originally proposed for funding to the office of naval research but was refused johnson obtained later funding by framing the engine as a hydrogen fuel cell johnson is collaborating with parc on development of the engine the jtec converts heat into electrical energy by compressing and expanding hydrogen gas it operates as a closed system with no moving classical mechanical parts requires no input of fuel and creates no exhaust the engine consists of two stages a low temperature compression stage and a high temperature power stage each stage consists of a working fluid chamber that a copper lined membrane electrode assembly mea bisects a mea is a proprietary ceramic proton exchange membrane pem that is sandwiched between two electrodes in the high temperature power stage expanding high pressure hydrogen from the compression stage

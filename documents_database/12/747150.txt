lysyl hydroxylases require iron and vitamin c as cofactors for their oxidation activity it takes place as a post translational modification following collagen synthesis in the cisternae lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum er there are three lysyl hydroxylases lh1 3 encoded in the human genome namely plod1 plod2 and plod3 from plod2 two splice variant can be expressed lh2a and lh2b where lh2b differs from lh2a by incorporating the small exon 13a lh1 and lh3 hydroxylate lysyl residues in the collagen triple helix whereas lh2b hydroxylates lysyl residues in the telopeptides of collagen in addition to its hydroxylation activity lh3 has glycosylation activity that produces either monosaccharide gal or disaccharide glc gal attached to collagen hydroxylysines collagen lysyl hydroxylation is the first step in collagen pyridinoline cross linking that is necessary for the stabilization of collagen mutations in the plod1 gene have been linked to kyphoscoliotic ehlers danlos syndrome keds in the past eds vi mutations in the plod2 gene have been linked to bruck syndrome in humans a deficiency in its cofactor vitamin c is associated with scurvy

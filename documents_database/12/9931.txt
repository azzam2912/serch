using pcr copies of dna sequences are exponentially amplified to generate thousands to millions of more copies of that particular dna segment pcr is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical laboratory and clinical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including biomedical research and criminal forensics pcr was developed by kary mullis in 1983 while he was an employee of the cetus corporation he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1993 along with michael smith for his work in developing the method the vast majority of pcr methods rely on thermal cycling thermal cycling exposes reactants to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature dependent reactions specifically dna melting and enzyme driven dna replication pcr employs two main reagents primers which are short single strand dna fragments known as oligonucleotides that are a complementary sequence to the target dna region and a dna polymerase in the first step of pcr the two strands of the dna double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called dna melting in the second step the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of dna the

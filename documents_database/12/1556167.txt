it repairs breaks that occur on only one of dna s two strands known as single strand gaps the recf pathway can also repair double strand breaks in dna when the recbcd pathway another pathway of homologous recombination in bacteria is inactivated by mutations like the recbcd pathway the recf pathway requires reca for strand invasion the two pathways are also similar in their phases of branch migration in which the holliday junction slides in one direction and resolution in which the holliday junctions are cleaved apart by enzymes the recf pathway begins when recj an exonuclease that cleaves single stranded dna in the 5 3 direction binds to the 5 end of a single strand gap in dna and starts moving upstream while cleaving the 5 strand although recj can function without them single strand binding protein ssbp and the recq helicase greatly increase how much the 5 is cut back when present ssbp binds to the 3 overhang remaining after recj finishes cutting back the 5 strand by binding to the single stranded dna ssbp ensures that the 3 dna overhang does not stick to itself through self complementation the reca protein can be loaded onto the ssbp

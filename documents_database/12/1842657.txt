within this double layer the first layer corresponds to the charged surface these charges may originate from tightly adsorbed ions dissociated surface groups or substituted ions within the crystal lattice the second layer corresponds to the diffuse layer which contains the neutralizing charge consisting of accumulated counterions and depleted coions the resulting potential profile between these two objects leads to differences in the ionic concentrations within the gap between these objects with respect to the bulk solution these differences generate an osmotic pressure which generates a force between these objects these forces are easily experienced when hands are washed with soap adsorbing soap molecules make the skin negatively charged and the slippery feeling is caused by the strongly repulsive double layer forces these forces are further relevant in many colloidal or biological systems and may be responsible for their stability formation of colloidal crystals or their rheological properties the most popular model to describe the electrical double layer is the poisson boltzmann pb model this model can be equally used to evaluate double layer forces let us discuss this model in the case of planar geometry as shown in the figure on the right in this case the electrical potential

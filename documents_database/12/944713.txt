it enables t cells to migrate to lymph node b cell zones in humans the cxc r5 protein is encoded by the cxcr5 gene the blr1 cxcr5 gene is specifically expressed in burkitt s lymphoma and lymphatic tissues such as follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen the gene plays an essential role in b cell migration through cxcl13 secretions b cells are able to locate the lymph node additionally some recent studies have suggested that cxcl13 though cxcr5 is capable of recruiting hematopoietic precursor cells cd3 cd4 which would cause the development of lymph nodes and peyer s patches other studies highlight the role of cxcr5 in t cells as they are unable to access b cell follicles without cxcr5 expression this is a key step in the production of high affinity antibodies as b cells and t cells need to interact in order to activate the ig class switch cxcr5 has been shown to be expressed on both cd4 and cd8 t cells though it is often regarded as the defining marker for t follicular helper tfh cells recently it was shown that cxcr5 overexpression in breast cancer patients highly correlates with lymph node metastases and

on 3 june 1979 the well suffered a blowout resulting in one of the largest oil spills in history mexico s state owned oil company pemex petr leos mexicanos was drilling a deep oil well when the drilling rig sedco 135 lost drilling mud circulation in modern rotary drilling mud is circulated down the drill pipe and back up the well bore to the surface the goal is to equalize the pressure through the shaft and to monitor the returning mud for gas without the counter pressure provided by the circulating mud the pressure in the formation allowed oil to fill the well column blowing out the well the oil caught fire and sedco 135 burned and collapsed into the sea at the time of the accident sedco 135 was drilling at a depth of about below the seafloor the day before ixtoc suffered the blowout and resulting fire that caused her to sink the drill bit hit a region of soft strata subsequently the circulation of drilling mud was lost resulting in a loss of hydrostatic pressure rather than returning to the surface the drilling mud was escaping into fractures that had formed in the rock at the bottom

the resulting techniques are important for engineering architecture design and in art the theoretical basis for descriptive geometry is provided by planar geometric projections the earliest known publication on the technique was underweysung der messung mit dem zirckel und richtscheyt published in linien nuremberg 1525 by albrecht d rer gaspard monge is usually considered the father of descriptive geometry due to his developments in geometric problem solving his first discoveries were in 1765 while he was working as a draftsman for military fortifications although his findings were published later on monge s protocols allow an imaginary object to be drawn in such a way that it may be modeled in three dimensions all geometric aspects of the imaginary object are accounted for in true size to scale and shape and can be imaged as seen from any position in space all images are represented on a two dimensional surface descriptive geometry uses the image creating technique of imaginary parallel projectors emanating from an imaginary object and intersecting an imaginary plane of projection at right angles the cumulative points of intersections create the desired image aside from the orthographic six standard principal views front right side left side top bottom rear

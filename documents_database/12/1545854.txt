they have been used to deliver sirnas therapeutically to mammals in vivo in snalps the sirna is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing a mixture of cationic and fusogenic lipids coated with diffusible polyethylene glycol rna interference rnai is a process that occurs naturally within the cytoplasm inhibiting gene expression at specific sequences regulation of gene expression through rnai is possible by introducing small interfering rnas sirnas which effectively silence expression of a targeted gene rnai activates the rna induced silencing complex risc containing sirna sirna derived from cleaved dsrna the sirna guides the risc complex to a specific sequence on the mrna that is cleaved by risc and consequently silences those genes however without modifications to the rna backbone or inclusion of inverted bases at either end sirna instability in the plasma makes it extremely difficult to apply this technique in vivo pattern recognition receptors prrs which can be grouped as endocytic prrs or signaling prrs are expressed in all cells of the innate immune system signaling prrs in particular include toll like receptors tlrs and are involved primarily with identifying pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps for example tlrs can recognize specific regions conserved in various pathogens recognition stimulating

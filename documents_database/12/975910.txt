the hydrogen anion is an important constituent of the atmosphere of stars such as the sun in chemistry this ion is called hydride the ion has two electrons bound by the electromagnetic force to a nucleus containing one proton the binding energy of h equals the binding energy of an extra electron to a hydrogen atom called electron affinity of hydrogen it is measured to be or see electron affinity data page the total ground state energy thus becomes the hydrogen anion is the dominant bound free opacity source at visible and near infrared wavelengths in the atmospheres of stars like the sun and cooler mihalas 1978 its importance was first noted in the 1930s wildt 1939 the ion absorbs photons with energies in the range 0 75 4 0 ev which ranges from the infrared into the visible spectrum rau 1996 srinivasan 1999 most of the electrons in these negative ions come from the ionization of metals with low first ionization potentials including the alkali metals and alkali earths the process which ejects the electron from the ion is properly called photodetachment rather than photoionization because the result is a neutral atom rather than an ion and a free

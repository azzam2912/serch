the gcm motif is a domain that has been identified in proteins belonging to a family of transcriptional regulators involved in fundamental developmental processes which comprise drosophila melanogaster gcm and its mammalian homologues human gcm1 and gcm2 in gcm transcription factors the n terminal moiety contains a dna binding domain of 150 amino acids sequence conservation is highest in this gcm domain in contrast the c terminal moiety contains one or two transactivating regions and is only poorly conserved the gcm motif has been shown to be a dna binding domain that recognises preferentially the nonpalindromic octamer 5 atgcgggt 3 the gcm motif contains many conserved basic amino acid residues seven cysteine residues and four histidine residues the conserved cysteines are involved in shaping the overall conformation of the domain in the process of dna binding and in the redox regulation of dna binding the gcm domain as a new class of zn containing dna binding domain with no similarity to any other dna binding domain the gcm domain consists of a large and a small domain tethered together by one of the two zn ions present in the structure the large and the small domains comprise five and three

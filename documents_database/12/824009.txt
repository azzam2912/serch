it was introduced by it is given by when formula 3 and if formula 5 here formula 6 is the infinite q pochhammer symbol the formula 1 gamma function satisfies the functional equation in addition the formula 1 gamma function satisfies the q analog of the bohr mollerup theorem which was found by richard askey for non negative integers n where formula 11 is the q factorial function thus the formula 1 gamma function can be considered as an extension of the q factorial function to the real numbers the relation to the ordinary gamma function is made explicit in the limit there is a simple proof of this limit by gosper see the appendix of the formula 1 gamma function satisfies the q analog of the gauss multiplication formula the formula 1 gamma function has the following integral representation moak obtained the following q analogue of the stirling formula see where formula 21 formula 22 denotes the heaviside step function formula 23 stands for the bernoulli number formula 24 is the dilogarithm and formula 25 is a polynomial of degree formula 26 satisfying due to i mez the q analogue of the raabe formula exists at least if we

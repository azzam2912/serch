made without reference to standards were based on fundamental physical characteristics and their relation to the molar mass the most useful of these were membrane osmometry and sedimentation another absolute instrumental approach was also possible with the development of light scattering theory by einstein raman debye zimm and others the problem with measurements made using membrane osmometry and sedimentation was that they only characterized the bulk properties of the polymer sample moreover the measurements were excessively time consuming and prone to operator error in order to gain information about a polydisperse mixture of molar masses a method for separating the different sizes was developed this was achieved by the advent of size exclusion chromatography sec sec is based on the fact that the pores in the packing material of chromatography columns could be made small enough for molecules to become temporarily lodged in their interstitial spaces as the sample makes its way through a column the smaller molecules spend more time traveling in these void spaces than the larger ones which have fewer places to wander the result is that a sample is separated according to its hydrodynamic volume formula 1 as a consequence the big molecules come out first

it has schl fli symbol of 4 4 meaning it has 4 squares around every vertex conway calls it a quadrille the internal angle of the square is 90 degrees so four squares at a point make a full 360 degrees it is one of three regular tilings of the plane the other two are the triangular tiling and the hexagonal tiling there are 9 distinct uniform colorings of a square tiling naming the colors by indices on the 4 squares around a vertex 1111 1112 i 1112 ii 1122 1123 i 1123 ii 1212 1213 1234 i cases have simple reflection symmetry and ii glide reflection symmetry three can be seen in the same symmetry domain as reduced colorings 1112 from 1213 1123 from 1234 and 1112 reduced from 1123 this tiling is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra and tilings extending into the hyperbolic plane 4 p p 3 4 5 this tiling is also topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra and tilings with four faces per vertex starting with the octahedron with schl fli symbol n 4 and coxeter diagram with n progressing to infinity like the uniform polyhedra

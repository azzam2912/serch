a sap s ability to absorb water depends on the ionic concentration of the aqueous solution in deionized and distilled water an sap may absorb 300 times its weight from 30 to 60 times its own volume and can become up to 99 9 liquid but when put into a 0 9 saline solution the absorbency drops to approximately 50 times its weight the presence of valence cations in the solution impedes the polymer s ability to bond with the water molecule the total absorbency and swelling capacity are controlled by the type and degree of cross linkers used to make the gel low density cross linked saps generally have a higher absorbent capacity and swell to a larger degree these types of saps also have a softer and stickier gel formation high cross link density polymers exhibit lower absorbent capacity and swell but the gel strength is firmer and can maintain particle shape even under modest pressure the largest use of saps is found in personal disposable hygiene products such as baby diapers adult diapers and sanitary napkins sap was discontinued from use in tampons due to 1980s concern over a link with toxic shock syndrome sap is also

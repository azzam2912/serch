jem the bee performs the following functions core applications are usually performed through batch processing which involves executing one or more batch jobs in a sequential flow the job entry manager jem helps receive jobs schedule them for processing and determine how job output is processed like ibm jes2 many batch jobs are run in parallel and jcl is used to control the operation of each job correct use of jcl parameters allows parallel asynchronous execution of jobs that may need access the same data sets one goal of a jem is to process work while making the best use of system resources to achieve this goal resource management is needed during key phases jem clustering is based on hazelcast each cluster member called node has the same rights and responsibilities of the others with the exception of the oldest member that we are going to see in details this is because hazelcast implements a peer to peer clustering so that there s no master node when a node starts up it checks to see if there s already a cluster in the network there are two ways to find this out if no cluster is found the node will

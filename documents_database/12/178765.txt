in sexually reproducing diploid animals different mating strategies are employed by males and females because the cost of gamete production is lower for males than it is for females the different mating tactics employed by males and females are thought to be the outcome of stochastic reproductive conflicts both ecologically and socially reproductive conflicts in animal societies may arise because individuals are not genetically identical and they have different optimal strategies for maximizing their fitness and oftentimes it is found that reproductive conflicts generally arise due to dominance hierarchy in which all or a major part of reproduction is monopolized by only one individual wasp in the polistes carolina the dominant queen amongst female wasps is determined by whoever arrives at the nest first rather than the largest foundress who is expected to be the best at fighting wasp in a study of prunella collaris the close proximity and sharing of ranges on the mountain tops of the french pyrenees led to a polygynandrous mating system where two to four males would mate with a range of two to four females within the same vicinity polygynandry is another way to describe a multi male and multi female polygamous mating system

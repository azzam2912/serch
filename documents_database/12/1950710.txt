it is one of the largest lqg s known with the estimated maximum diameter of 780 mpc 2 2 billion light years and contains 38 quasars it was discovered in 2011 during the course of the sloan digital sky survey until the discovery of the huge lqg in november 2012 it was the largest known structure in the universe beating clowes campusano lqg s 20 year record as largest known structure at the time of its discovery the structure is located approximately 2 away from the clowes campusano lqg cclqg it is at redshift z 1 11 hence its name corresponding to a distance of approximately 8 8 billion light years away it is adjacent to the cclqg and is relatively close to u1 54 another lqg it compromises 38 quasars and may suggest the evolution of a large galaxy filament according to the cosmological principle the random distribution of matter and energy within the different parts of the universe must be approximately homogeneous and isotropic and that random overdensities of these objects must be small if projected on a large enough scale whilst yadav et al projected that the maximum structural sizes was somewhere around 260 h mpc while

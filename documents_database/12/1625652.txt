physically fragility may be related to the presence of dynamical heterogeneity in glasses as well as to the breakdown of the usual stokes einstein relationship between viscosity and diffusion formally fragility reflects the degree to which the temperature dependence of the viscosity or relaxation time deviates from arrhenius behavior this classification was originally proposed by austen angell the most common definition of fragility is the kinetic fragility index m which characterizes the slope of the viscosity or relaxation time of a material with temperature as it approaches the glass transition temperature from above formula 1 where formula 2 is viscosity t is the glass transition temperature m is fragility and t is temperature glass formers with a high fragility are called fragile those with a low fragility are called strong for example silica has a relatively low fragility and is called strong whereas some polymers have relatively high fragility and are called fragile fragility has no direct relationship with the colloquial meaning of the word fragility which more closely relates to the brittleness of a material several fragility parameters have been introduced to characterise the fragility of liquids including the bruning sutton avramov and doremus fragility parameters the bruning sutton

in turn these two fossorial genera are the sister group to the terrestrial trinomys in the phylogeny of the family echimyidae euryzygomatomyinae is the sister group to a large assemblage comprising carterodon and the family capromyidae these phylogenetic relationships based on the comparison of complete mitochondrial dna genomes and nuclear dna exons disagree with analyses of craniodental characters which cluster together the fossorial genera clyomys euryzygomatomys and carterodon

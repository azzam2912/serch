it can be further split into an internal and an external oam the internal oam is an origin independent angular momentum of a light beam that can be associated with a helical or twisted wavefront the external oam is the origin dependent angular momentum that can be obtained as cross product of the light beam position center of the beam and its total linear momentum a beam of light carries a linear momentum formula 1 and hence it can be also attributed an external angular momentum formula 2 this external angular momentum depends on the choice of the origin of the coordinate system if one chooses the origin at the beam axis and the beam is cylindrically symmetric at least in its momentum distribution the external angular momentum will vanish the external angular momentum is a form of oam because it is unrelated to polarization and depends on the spatial distribution of the optical field e a more interesting example of oam is the internal oam appearing when a paraxial light beam is in a so called helical mode helical modes of the electromagnetic field are characterized by a wavefront that is shaped as a helix with an optical vortex

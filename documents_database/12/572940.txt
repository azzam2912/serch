the word dreikanter is german for three edged similarly a zweikanter two edged has two wind facets an einkanter one edged has only one wind facet most places on the planet have several weathering processes acting at the same time so finding good examples of dreikanters is often difficult antarctica is a good location for finding such ventifacts since wind is usually the only active weathering agent many specimens in the northeastern united states were formed during the pleistocene era when the absence of vegetation made for little cover from wind blown sediment some common features of dreikanters include fluting high polish sharp ridges pits grooves and helical forms in areas where there is a prevailing wind sand and debris cause a rock face to become flattened and polished this changes the mass distribution of the rock and may cause it to turn another surface toward the wind if this process continues undisturbed the resulting rock will have three distinct flattened and polished faces dreikanters generally form in dry arid environments from hard rocks

it includes poposaurids shuvosaurids ctenosauriscids and other unusual pseudosuchians such as qianosuchus and lotosaurus however it excludes most large predatory quadrupedal rauisuchians such as rauisuchids and prestosuchids those reptiles are now allied with crocodylomorphs crocodile ancestors in a clade known as loricata which is the sister taxon to the poposauroids in the clade paracrocodylomorpha although it was first formally defined in 2007 the name poposauroidea has been used for many years the group has been referred to as poposauridae by some authors although this name is often used more narrowly to refer to the family that includes poposaurus and its close relatives poposauroids went extinct at the end of the triassic period along with other non crocodylomorph pseudosuchians however they were among the most diverse and long lasting members of non crocodylomorph pseudosuchia with xilousuchus a ctenosauriscid living near the very beginning of the triassic and effigia a shuvosaurid surviving up until near the end of the triassic despite the high level of diversity and anatomical disparity within poposauroidea certain features of the clade can be determined particularly in the structure of the snout and pelvis hip many of these features are examples of convergent evolution with dinosaurs with bipedal

originally designed and implemented at hewlett packard labs in palo alto california timesten spun out into a separate startup in 1996 and was acquired by oracle corporation in 2005 all data within a timesten database is located in physical memory ram which means that no data operation requires disk i o this is unlike traditional disk optimized relational databases such as the oracle database db2 informix or sql server whose designs must contain algorithms that attempt to minimize disk accesses timesten provides applications with short consistent response times and very high throughput as required by applications with database intensive workloads as memory operates far faster than hard disk timesten is used in applications where service level agreements require low and predictable response times such as telecommunications real time financial services trading applications network equipment and large web applications also unlike other memory caching systems that use key value pairs such as memcached hazelcast or coherence timesten can be accessed with standard interfaces and provides the functionality of the sql query language applications with data residing in an oracle database can utilize timesten through a database caching option as distinct from oracle database in memory in which timesten functions as an

the modulation may be imposed on the phase frequency amplitude or polarization of the beam modulation bandwidths extending into the gigahertz range are possible with the use of laser controlled modulators the electro optic effect is the change in the refractive index of a material resulting from the application of a dc or low frequency electric field this is caused by forces that distort the position orientation or shape of the molecules constituting the material generally a nonlinear optical material organic polymers have the fastest response rates and thus are best for this application with an incident static or low frequency optical field will see a modulation of its refractive index the simplest kind of eom consists of a crystal such as lithium niobate whose refractive index is a function of the strength of the local electric field that means that if lithium niobate is exposed to an electric field light will travel more slowly through it but the phase of the light leaving the crystal is directly proportional to the length of time it takes that light to pass through it therefore the phase of the laser light exiting an eom can be controlled by changing the electric field

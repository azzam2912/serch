here c refers to any of the categories of smooth piecewise linear or topological manifolds the theorem was first proved by stephen smale for which he received the fields medal and is a fundamental result in the theory of high dimensional manifolds for a start it almost immediately proves the generalized poincar conjecture before smale proved this theorem mathematicians became stuck while trying to understand manifolds of dimension 3 or 4 and assumed that the higher dimensional cases were even harder the h cobordism theorem showed that simply connected manifolds of dimension at least 5 are much easier than those of dimension 3 or 4 the proof of the theorem depends on the whitney trick of hassler whitney which geometrically untangles homologically tangled spheres of complementary dimension in a manifold of dimension 4 an informal reason why manifolds of dimension 3 or 4 are unusually hard is that the trick fails to work in lower dimensions which have no room for untanglement let n be at least 5 and let w be a compact n 1 dimensional h cobordism between m and n in the category c diff pl or top such that w m and n are simply connected

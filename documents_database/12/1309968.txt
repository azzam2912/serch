typically property testing algorithms are used to decide if some mathematical object such as a graph or a boolean function has a global property or is far from having this property using only a small number of local queries to the object for example the following promise problem admits an algorithm whose query complexity is independent of the instance size for an arbitrary constant 0 property testing algorithms are central to the definition of probabilistically checkable proofs as a probabilistically checkable proof is essentially a proof that can be verified by a property testing algorithm formally a property testing algorithm with query complexity q n and proximity parameter for a decision problem l is a randomized algorithm that on input x an instance of l makes at most q x queries to x and behaves as follows here x is far from l means that the hamming distance between x and any string in l is at least x a property testing algorithm is said to have one sided error if it satisfies the stronger condition that the accepting probability for instances x l is 1 instead of a property testing algorithm is said be non adaptive if it performs

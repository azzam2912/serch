it may be operated manually for example a light switch or a keyboard button may be operated by a moving object such as a door or may be operated by some sensing element for pressure temperature or flow a switch will have one or more sets of contacts which may operate simultaneously sequentially or alternately switches in high powered circuits must operate rapidly to prevent destructive arcing and may include special features to assist in rapidly interrupting a heavy current multiple forms of actuators are used for operation by hand or to sense position level temperature or flow special types are used for example for control of machinery to reverse electric motors or to sense liquid level many specialized forms exist a common use is control of lighting where multiple switches may be wired into one circuit to allow convenient control of light fixtures by analogy with the devices that select one or more possible paths for electric currents devices that route information in a computer network are also called switches these are usually more complicated than simple electromechanical toggles or pushbutton devices and operate without direct human interaction the most familiar form of switch is a manually operated electromechanical

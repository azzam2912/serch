it consists of the shortest wavelength electromagnetic waves and so imparts the highest photon energy paul villard a french chemist and physicist discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium in 1903 ernest rutherford named this radiation gamma rays based on their relatively strong penetration of matter he had previously discovered two less penetrating types of decay radiation which he named alpha rays and beta rays in ascending order of penetrating power gamma rays from radioactive decay are in the energy range from a few kiloelectronvolts kev to approximately 8 megaelectronvolts 8 mev corresponding to the typical energy levels in nuclei with reasonably long lifetimes the energy spectrum of gamma rays can be used to identify the decaying radionuclides using gamma spectroscopy very high energy gamma rays in the 100 1000 teraelectronvolt tev range have been observed from sources such as the cygnus x 3 microquasar natural sources of gamma rays originating on earth are mostly as a result of radioactive decay and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles however there are other rare natural sources such as terrestrial gamma ray flashes which produce gamma rays from electron action upon the nucleus notable artificial

the idea was developed in early 20th century europe with ley line believers arguing that these alignments were recognised by ancient european societies which deliberately erected structures along them since the 1960s members of the earth mysteries movement and other esoteric traditions have commonly believed that such ley lines demarcate earth energies and serve as guides for alien spacecraft archaeologists and scientists regard ley lines as an example of pseudo archaeology and pseudo science the idea of leys as straight tracks across the landscape was put forward by the english antiquarian alfred watkins in the 1920s particularly in his book the old straight track he argued that straight lines could be drawn between various historic structures and that these represented trade routes created by ancient british societies although he gained a small following watkins ideas were never accepted by the british archaeological establishment a fact that frustrated him his critics noted that his ideas relied on drawing lines between sites established at different periods of the past they also argued that in prehistory as in the present it was impractical to travel in a straight line across hilly or mountainous areas of britain rendering his leys unlikely as trade routes

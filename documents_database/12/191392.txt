delivering almost 22 more thrust with 40 fewer parts than its f100 predecessor the f119 allows sustained supercruise speeds of up to mach 1 8 the f119 s nozzles incorporate 2d thrust vectoring technology these nozzles direct the engine thrust 20 in the pitch axis to give the f 22 enhanced maneuverability the f119 derivative the pratt whitney f135 produces up to of thrust for the lockheed martin f 35 lightning ii the f119 resulted from the joint advanced fighter engine jafe program in the early 1980s aimed at supplying the powerplant for the air force s advanced tactical fighter atf detailed design of pratt whitney s submission designated internally as pw5000 began when the jafe request for proposals rfp was released in may 1983 advances in engine technology such as those from the integrated high performance turbine engine technology ihptet program allowed the design to do more work with fewer stages with the pw5000 having only 6 compressor stages compared to the f100 s 10 compressor stages the high pressure and low pressure turbines were single stage and counter rotating thus shortening the engine by removing a row of stators and saving weight the fan and compressor stages were

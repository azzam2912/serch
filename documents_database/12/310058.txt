the glomus body consists of an arteriovenous shunt surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue glomus bodies are most numerous in the fingers and toes the role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the skin surface when exposed to cold temperature thus preventing heat loss and allowing maximum blood flow to the skin in warm weather to allow heat to dissipate the glomus body has high sympathetic tone and potentiation leads to near complete vasoconstriction endothelial cells form a single continuous layer that lines all vascular segments junctional complexes keep the endothelial cells together in arteries but are less numerous in veins the organization of the endothelial cell layer in capillaries varies greatly depending on the organ the glomus bodies in the skin and elsewhere are unusual in that their endothelial cells exist in multiple layers of cells called myoepithelioid cells these glomus bodies control small arteriovenous shunts or anastomoses the arteriovenous shunt in the glomus body is a normal anatomic shunt as opposed to an abnormal arteriovenous fistula a metarteriole is another type

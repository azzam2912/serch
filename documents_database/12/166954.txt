it is also the name for the most common member of this group n acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac or nana sialic acids are found widely distributed in animal tissues and to a lesser extent in other organisms ranging from fungi to yeasts and bacteria mostly in glycoproteins and gangliosides they occur at the end of sugar chains connected to the surfaces of cells and soluble proteins that is because it seems to have appeared late in evolution however it has been observed in drosophila embryos and other insects and in the capsular polysaccharides of certain strains of bacteria generally plants do not contain or display sialic acids in humans the brain has the highest sialic acid concentration where these acids play an important role in neural transmission and ganglioside structure in synaptogenesis more than 50 kinds of sialic acid are known all of which can be obtained from a molecule of neuraminic acid by substituting its amino group of one of its hydroxil groups in general the amino group bears either an acetyl or a glycolyl group but other modifications have been described these modifications along with linkages have shown to be tissue specific and developmentally regulated expressions so some of

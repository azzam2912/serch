they typically occur in people who have a compromised immune system they are sometimes equated with immunoproliferative disorders but technically lymphoproliferative disorders are a subset of immunoproliferative disorders along with hypergammaglobulinemia and paraproteinemias lymphoproliferative disorders are a set of disorders characterized by the abnormal proliferation of lymphocytes into a monoclonal lymphocytosis the two major types of lymphocytes are b cells and t cells which are derived from pluripotent hematopoetic stem cells in the bone marrow individuals who have some sort of dysfunction with their immune system are susceptible to develop a lymphoproliferative disorder because when any of the numerous control points of the immune system become dysfunctional immunodeficiency or deregulation of lymphocytes is more likely to occur there are several inherited gene mutations that have been identified to cause lymphoproliferative disorders however there are also acquired and iatrogenic causes a mutation on the x chromosome is associated with a t cell and natural killer cell lymphoproliferative disorder some children with autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorders are heterozygous for a mutation in the gene that codes for the fas receptor which is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at position 24 1 denoted 10q24 1 this gene is member 6 of

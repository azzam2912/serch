statistical manifolds provide a setting for the field of information geometry the fisher information metric provides a metric on these manifolds the family of all normal distributions parametrized by the expected value and the variance 0 with the riemannian metric given by the fisher information matrix is a statistical manifold its geometry is modeled on hyperbolic space a simple example of a statistical manifold taken from physics would be the canonical ensemble it is a one dimensional manifold with the temperature t serving as the coordinate on the manifold for any fixed temperature t one has a probability space so for a gas of atoms it would be the probability distribution of the velocities of the atoms as one varies the temperature t the probability distribution varies another simple example taken from medicine would be the probability distribution of patient outcomes in response to the quantity of medicine administered that is for a fixed dose some patients improve and some do not this is the base probability space if the dosage is varied then the probability of outcomes changes thus the dosage is the coordinate on the manifold to be a smooth manifold one would have to measure outcomes in

tube testers evolved along with the vacuum tube to satisfy the demands of the time and their evolution ended with the tube era the first tube testers were simple units designed for specific tubes to be used in the battlefields of world war i by radio operators so they could easily test the tubes of their communication equipment the most modern testers perform a multitude of the below tests and are fully automated examples of modern testers include the amplitrex at1000 the space tech lab easytubetester the maxi pre amp tester and the maxi matcher power tubes only by maxi test and the new and somewhat more primitive divo vt1000 by orange amplification while the at1000 easytubetester and the maxi test brand testers offer precise measurements of transconductance gm and emissions ip at full or near full voltages the orange tester offers a very simple numerical quality scale the easytubetester has a unique feature of quick tube matching percentage display the simplest tester is the filament continuity tester usually with a neon lamp connected in series with the filament heater and a current limiting resistance fed directly by the mains there is therefore no need to select the appropriate filament

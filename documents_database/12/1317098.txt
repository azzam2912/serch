as dna is printed on a glass slide for the transfection process the deliberate introduction of nucleic acids into cells to occur before the addition of adherent cells the order of addition of dna and adherent cells is reverse that of conventional transfection hence the word reverse is used a dna gelatin mixture may be used for printing onto a slide gelatin powder is first dissolved in sterile milli q water to form a 0 2 gelatin solution purified dna plasmid is then mixed with the gelatin solution and the final gelatin concentration is kept greater than 0 17 besides gelatin atelocollagen and fibronetin are also successful transfection vectors for introducing foreign dna into the cell nucleus after the dna gelatin mixture preparation the mixture is pipetted onto a slide surface and the slide is placed in a covered petri dish a desiccant is added to the dish to dry up the solution finally cultured cells are poured into the dish for plasmid uptake however with the invention of different types of microarray printing systems hundreds of transfection mixes containing different dna of interest may be printed on the same slide for cell uptake of plasmids there are two major

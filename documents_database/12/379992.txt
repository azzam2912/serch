the pharmaceutical analogs of naturally occurring gm csf are called sargramostim and molgramostim unlike granulocyte colony stimulating factor which specifically promotes neutrophil proliferation and maturation gm csf affects more cell types especially macrophages and eosinophils gm csf is a monomeric glycoprotein that functions as a cytokine it is a white blood cell growth factor gm csf stimulates stem cells to produce granulocytes neutrophils eosinophils and basophils and monocytes monocytes exit the circulation and migrate into tissue whereupon they mature into macrophages and dendritic cells thus it is part of the immune inflammatory cascade by which activation of a small number of macrophages can rapidly lead to an increase in their numbers a process crucial for fighting infection gm csf also has some effects on mature cells of the immune system these include for example inhibiting neutrophil migration and causing an alteration of the receptors expressed on the cells surface gm csf signals via signal transducer and activator of transcription stat5 in macrophages it has also been shown to signal via stat3 the cytokine activates macrophages to inhibit fungal survival it induces deprivation in intracellular free zinc and increases production of reactive oxygen species that culminate in fungal zinc starvation and

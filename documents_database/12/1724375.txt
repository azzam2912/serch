they were introduced by in his study of bounded homogeneous domains a siegel domain of the first kind or first type or genus 1 is the open subset of c of elements z such that where v is an open convex cone in r these are special cases of tube domains an example is the siegel upper half plane where v r is the cone of positive definite quadratic forms in r and m k k 1 2 a siegel domain of the second kind or second type or genus 2 also called a piatetski shapiro domain is the open subset of c c of elements z w such that where v is an open convex cone in r and f is a v valued hermitian form on c if n 0 this is a siegel domain of the first kind a siegel domain of the third kind or third type or genus 3 is the open subset of c c c of elements z w t such that where v is an open convex cone in r and l is a v valued semi hermitian form on c a bounded domain is an open connected bounded subset of a

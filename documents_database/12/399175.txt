if the mean amplitude is zero there is no dc bias a waveform with no dc bias is known as a dc balanced or dc free waveform the term originates in electronics where dc refers to a direct current voltage in contrast various other non dc frequencies are analogous to superimposed alternating current ac voltages or currents hence called ac components or ac coefficients in the design of electronic amplifier circuits every active device has biasing to set its operating point the steady state current and voltage on the device when no signal is applied in bipolar transistor biasing for example a network of resistors is used to apply a small amount of dc to the base terminal of the transistor the ac signal is applied at the same terminal and is amplified the bias network is designed to preserve the applied ac signal similarly amplifiers using field effect transistors or vacuum tubes also have bias circuits the operating point of an amplifier greatly affects its characteristics of distortion and efficiency power amplifier classes are distinguished by the operating point set by the dc bias dc offset is usually undesirable when it causes clipping or other undesirable change in the

it attempts to provide efficient predictable and scalable quality of service qos end to end tao applies the best software practices and patterns to automate the delivery of high performance and real time qos to distributed applications tao is for developers of distributed and embedded applications who have stringent performance demands certain real time applications have benefited from tao s use of familiar software concepts to present a solution to challenging real time software problems in general real time systems require predictable timing characteristics and robustness since they are used in mission critical domains other real time applications require low development cost and fast time to market tao addresses both of these by providing an already implemented general purpose communications framework that uses concepts familiar to non real time portions of the software industry traditionally the barrier to viable real time corba has been that many real time challenges are associated with end to end system design aspects that transcend the layering boundaries traditionally associated with corba that s why tao integrates the network interfaces os i o subsystem orb and middleware services in order to provide an end to end solution for instance consider the corba event service which

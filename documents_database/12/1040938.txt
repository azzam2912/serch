the system is based on a new mathematical framework for geometry function representation frep which provides a uniform method to model both surface geometry and internal composition simultaneously it is also a compact and precise framework that can represent objects with unlimited complexity and properties compared to traditional modeling systems hyperfun is able to digitally describe create and modify models of any real or imagined object or environment technically complex geometric objects in hyperfun are constructed from simple primitives on which various operations are performed any object in three dimensional space is defined by a function of point coordinates f x y z this continuous real function is positive inside the object negative outside and takes zero value on its surface similarly a multidimensional object is defined by a function of several variables f x1 x2 x3 xn for example an object changing over time can be defined by f x y z t with t representing time attributes such as color or material density are also defined by corresponding functions this constitutes the new paradigm of procedural function based volume modeling and rendering where an object s shape and properties are locally evaluated on request using black box procedures

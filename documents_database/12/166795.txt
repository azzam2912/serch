an aliphatic diol is also called a glycol this pairing of functional groups is pervasive and many subcategories have been identified the most common industrial diol is ethylene glycol examples of diols in which the hydroxyl functional groups are more widely separated include 1 4 butanediol ho ch oh and propylene 1 3 diol or beta propylene glycol ho ch ch ch oh a geminal diol has two hydroxyl groups bonded to the same atom these species arise by hydration of the carbonyl compounds the hydration is usually unfavorable but a notable exception is formaldehyde which in water exists in equilibrium with methanediol hc oh another example is fc c oh the hydrated form of hexafluoroacetone many gem diols undergo further condensation to give dimeric and oligomeric derivatives this reaction applies to glyoxal and related aldehydes in a vicinal diol the two hydroxyl groups occupy vicinal positions that is they are attached to adjacent atoms these compounds are called glycols examples include 1 2 ethanediol or ethylene glycol ho ch oh a common ingredient of antifreeze products another example is propane 1 2 diol or alpha propylene glycol ho ch ch oh ch used in the food and medicine industry

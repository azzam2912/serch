prr30 is a member in the family of proline rich proteins characterized by their intrinsic lack of structure copy number variations in the prr30 gene have been associated with an increased risk for neurofibromatosis the prr30 gene is located on the short arm of human chromosome 2 at band 2p23 3 it flanked by prolactin regulatory element binding preb and transcription factor 23 tcf23 the gene has three exons in total prr30 has a length of 2618 base pairs of linear dna the prr30 promoter directly flanks the gene and is 1162 base pairs in length the prr30 mrna transcript is 2063 base pairs in length there are four splice sites total all of which are in the 5 utr there are no known isoforms or alternative splicing of prr30 human protein prr30 consists of 412 amino acid residues it has a molecular weight of 44 7 kdal and an isoelectric point of 10 7 it is proline rich and composed primarily of non essential amino acids there is a region of extreme conservation across orthologs spanning from residues 187 to 321 prr30 appears to be subcellularly localized to the cell nucleus netnes predicts a nuclear export signal from residues

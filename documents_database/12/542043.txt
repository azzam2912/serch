a bounded operator v on h is a dilation of t if where formula 2 is an orthogonal projection on h v is said to be a unitary dilation respectively normal isometric etc if v is unitary respectively normal isometric etc t is said to be a compression of v if an operator t has a spectral set formula 3 we say that v is a normal boundary dilation or a normal formula 4 dilation if v is a normal dilation of t and formula 5 some texts impose an additional condition namely that a dilation satisfy the following calculus property where f t is some specified functional calculus for example the polynomial or h calculus the utility of a dilation is that it allows the lifting of objects associated to t to the level of v where the lifted objects may have nicer properties see for example the commutant lifting theorem we can show that every contraction on hilbert spaces has a unitary dilation a possible construction of this dilation is as follows for a contraction t the operator is positive where the continuous functional calculus is used to define the square root the operator d is called the

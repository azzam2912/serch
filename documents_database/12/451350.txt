the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations is typically used to transform this weak formulation into the strong formulation differential equation free of the integration with arbitrary function the proof usually exploits the possibility to choose concentrated on an interval on which keeps sign positive or negative several versions of the lemma are in use basic versions are easy to formulate and prove more powerful versions are used when needed here smooth may be interpreted as infinitely differentiable but often is interpreted as twice continuously differentiable or continuously differentiable or even just continuous since these weaker statements may be strong enough for a given task compactly supported means vanishes outside formula 7 for some formula 8 formula 9 such that acontinuous differentiability of g is assumed then integration by parts reduces both statements to the basic version this case is attributed to joseph louis lagrange while the proof of differentiability of g is due to paul du bois reymond the given functions f g may be discontinuous provided that they are locally integrable on the given interval in this case lebesgue integration is meant the conclusions hold almost everywhere thus in all continuity points and differentiability of g is

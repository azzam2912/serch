the total length is about the aortic root is the portion of the aorta beginning at the aortic annulus and extending to the sinotubular junction it is sometimes regarded as a part of the ascending aorta and sometimes regarded as a separate entity from the rest of the ascending aorta between each commissure of the aortic valve and opposite the cusps of the aortic valve three small dilatations called the aortic sinuses the sinotubular junction is the point in the ascending aorta where the aortic sinuses end and the aorta becomes a tubular structure a thoracic aortic diameter greater than 3 5 cm is generally considered dilated whereas a diameter greater than 4 5 cm is generally considered to be a thoracic aortic aneurysm still the average diameter in the population varies by for example age and sex the upper limit of standard reference range of the ascending aorta may be up to 4 3 cm among large elderly individuals at the union of the ascending aorta with the aortic arch the caliber of the vessel is increased owing to a bulging of its right wall this dilatation is termed the bulb of the aorta and on transverse section presents

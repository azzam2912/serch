the thermostat suppresses fluctuations of the kinetic energy of the system and therefore cannot produce trajectories consistent with the canonical ensemble the temperature of the system is corrected such that the deviation exponentially decays with some time constant formula 1 though the thermostat does not generate a correct canonical ensemble especially for small systems for large systems on the order of hundreds or thousands of atoms molecules the approximation yields roughly correct results for most calculated properties the scheme is widely used due to the efficiency with which it relaxes a system to some target bath temperature in many instances systems are initially equilibrated using the berendsen scheme while properties are calculated using the widely known nos hoover thermostat which correctly generates trajectories consistent with a canonical ensemble however the berendsen thermostat can result in the flying ice cube effect an artifact which can be eliminated by using the more rigorous bussi donadio parrinello thermostat for this reason it has been recommended that usage of the berendsen thermostat be discontinued in almost all cases except for replication of prior studies

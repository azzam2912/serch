this type of competition is common among plants but also exists among animals size asymmetric competition usually results from large individuals monopolizing the resource by pre emption i e exploiting the resource before smaller individuals are able to obtain it size asymmetric competition has major effects on population structure and diversity within ecological communities resource competition can vary from complete symmetric all individuals receive the same amount of resources irrespective of their size known also as scramble competition to perfectly size symmetric all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass to absolutely size asymmetric the largest individuals exploit all the available resource the degree of size asymmetry can be described by the parameter in the following equation focusing on the partition of the resource r among n individuals of sizes bj ri refers to the amount of resource consumed by individual i in the neighbourhood of j when 1 competition is perfectly size symmetric e g if a large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor the large individual will acquire twice the amount of that resource i e both individuals will exploit the same amount of resource per biomass unit when 1 competition is

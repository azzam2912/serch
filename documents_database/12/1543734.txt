it is constructed using a metric and relies on the triangle inequality for efficient range and k nearest neighbor k nn queries while m trees can perform well in many conditions the tree can also have large overlap and there is no clear strategy on how to best avoid overlap in addition it can only be used for distance functions that satisfy the triangle inequality while many advanced dissimilarity functions used in information retrieval do not satisfy this as in any tree based data structure the m tree is composed of nodes and leaves in each node there is a data object that identifies it uniquely and a pointer to a sub tree where its children reside every leaf has several data objects for each node there is a radius formula 1 that defines a ball in the desired metric space thus every node formula 2 and leaf formula 3 residing in a particular node formula 4 is at most distance formula 1 from formula 4 and every node formula 2 and leaf formula 3 with node parent formula 4 keep the distance from it an m tree has these components and sub components the main idea is first to

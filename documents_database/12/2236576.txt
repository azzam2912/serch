it replaced amd s firepro s brand in 2016 compared to the radeon brand of mainstream consumer gamer products the radeon instinct branded products are intended to accelerate deep learning artificial neural network and high performance computing gpgpu applications the radeon instinct product line directly competes with nvidia s tesla and intel xeon phi lines of deep learning and gpgpu cards the three initial radeon instinct products were announced in december 2016 with each based on a different architecture the mi6 is a passively cooled polaris 10 based card with 16 gb of gddr5 memory and with a w tdp at 5 7 tflops fp16 and fp32 the mi6 is expected to be used primarily for inference rather than neural network training the mi6 has a peak double precision fp64 compute performance of 358 gflops the mi8 is a fiji based card analogous to the r9 nano and expected to have a high bandwidth memory at 8 2 tflops fp16 and fp32 the mi8 is marked toward inference the mi8 has a peak fp64 double precision compute performance 512 gflops the mi25 is a vega based card utilizing hbm2 memory the mi25 performance is expected to be 12 3 tflops

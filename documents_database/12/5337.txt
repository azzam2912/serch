glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide a subcategory of carbohydrates glucose is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide using energy from sunlight there it is used to make cellulose in cell walls which is the most abundant carbohydrate in energy metabolism glucose is the most important source of energy in all organisms glucose for metabolism is partially stored as a polymer in plants mainly as starch and amylopectin and in animals as glycogen glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar the naturally occurring form of glucose is glucose while glucose is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is of lesser importance glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group and is therefore referred to as an aldohexose the glucose molecule can exist in an open chain acyclic and ring cyclic form the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde c atom and the c 5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal in water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at ph 7 the cyclic one is the predominant glucose is a primary source of energy for living organisms

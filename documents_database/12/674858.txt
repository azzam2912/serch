forman s primary research focus has been the history of physics in which he has helped pioneer the application of cultural history to scientific developments forman is especially known for two controversial historical theses the first often called the forman thesis regards the influence of german culture on early interpretations of quantum mechanics forman argued that the culture of weimar germany through its emphasis on acausality individuality and visualizability anschaulichkeit contributed to the acceptance and interpretation of quantum mechanics forman s second thesis regards the influence of military funding on the character and course of scientific research he argued that during world war ii and the cold war the massive scale of defense related funding prompted a shift in physics from basic to applied research spurring considerable historical research on the effects of the military funding of science forman s recent work focuses on characterization of the modern postmodern transition in science society and culture forman 1971 argued the remarkable scientific achievements in quantum physics in weimar germany in the 1920s involved the cross product of the hostile intellectual atmosphere whereby many scientists rejected weimar germany as an illegitimate state and in which there were intellectual revolts against causality determinism

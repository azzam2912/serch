if this sum never reaches the additive identity the ring is said to have characteristic zero that is char r is the smallest positive number n such that if such a number n exists and 0 otherwise the characteristic may also be taken to be the exponent of the ring s additive group that is the smallest positive n such that for every element a of the ring again if n exists otherwise zero some authors do not include the multiplicative identity element in their requirements for a ring see and this definition is suitable for that convention otherwise the two definitions are equivalent due to the distributive law in rings if r and s are rings and there exists a ring homomorphism r s then the characteristic of s divides the characteristic of r this can sometimes be used to exclude the possibility of certain ring homomorphisms the only ring with characteristic 1 is the trivial ring which has only a single element if a nontrivial ring r does not have any nontrivial zero divisors then its characteristic is either 0 or prime in particular this applies to all fields to all integral domains and to all division rings

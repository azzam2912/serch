it was used in the commodore 128 computer to generate an 80 column 640 200 pixel rgb video display running alongside a vic ii which supported commodore 64 compatible graphics the dcr models as well as a few d models of the c128 used the later and more technically advanced 8568 d vdc controller originally intended for a planned but unreleased unix based business computer based around the zilog z8000 commodore designed the vdc into several prototype machines of these only the commodore 128 ever saw production unlike earlier mos video chips such as the popular vic ii the vdc had dedicated video memory 16 kilobytes 16 384 bytes upgradable to 64 kilobytes 65 536 bytes in the original or flat c128 and 64 kilobytes in the c128dcr this ram was not directly accessible by the microprocessor the 8563 was more difficult to produce than most of the rest of the mos technology line and initial yields were very low the early units also had significant reliability problems and tended to self destruct from overheating also there were timing issues with the vdc that would cause indirect load and store operations on its registers to malfunction officially the vdc was

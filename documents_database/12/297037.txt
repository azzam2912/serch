a phy device typically includes both physical coding sublayer pcs and physical medium dependent pmd layer functionality the ethernet phy is a component that operates at the physical layer of the osi network model it implements the ethernet physical layer portion of the 1000base t 100base tx and 10base t standards a phy chip phyceiver is commonly found on ethernet devices its purpose is to provide analog signal physical access to the link it is usually with a media independent interface mii interfaced to a mac chip in a microcontroller or other system that takes care of the higher layer functions more specifically the ethernet phy is a chip that implements the hardware send and receive function of ethernet frames it interfaces between the analog domain of ethernet s line modulation and the digital domain of link layer packet signaling the phy usually does not handle mac addressing as that is the link layer s job similarly wake on lan and boot rom functionality is implemented in the network interface card nic which may have phy mac and other functionality integrated into one chip or as separate chips examples include the microsemi simpliphy and synchrophy vsc82xx 84xx 85xx 86xx family

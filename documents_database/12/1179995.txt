for large real x the faddeeva function occurs as meaning that it is a convolution of a gaussian with a simple pole the function was tabulated by vera faddeeva and n n terent ev in 1954 it appears as nameless function w z in abramowitz and stegun 1964 formula 7 1 3 the name faddeeva function was apparently introduced by g p m poppe and c m j wijers in 1990 previously it was known as kramp s function probably after christian kramp early implementations used methods by walter gautschi 1969 70 acm algorithm 363 or by j humlicek 1982 a more efficient algorithm was proposed by poppe and wijers 1990 acm algorithm 680 j a c weideman 1994 proposed a particularly short algorithm that takes no more than eight lines of matlab code zaghloul and ali pointed out deficiencies of previous algorithms and proposed a new one 2011 acm algorithm 916 another algorithm has been proposed by m abrarov and b m quine 2011 2012 two software implementations which are free for non commercial use only were published in acm transactions on mathematical software toms as algorithm 680 in fortran later translated into c and algorithm 916 by zaghloul

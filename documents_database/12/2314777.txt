it was classified under the genus nuclearia and morphologically resembles to nuclearia species although it is smaller the diameter of the cell body measures approximately 4 m compared to nuclearia species which range between 9 60 m later it was determined that it phylogenetically belongs to a new nucleariid lineage distantly related to nuclearia and fonticula genera the other two previously described nucleriid genera thus parvularia atlantis emerged as a new genus and a new species at the onset of holomycota which contain a set of phylogenetic and morphological characteristics that make this species unique p atlantis feeds on rod shaped bacteria and present uni or bi nucleated cells during its life cycle p atlantis can form sphaerical cystic cells which cointain an embedded extracellular coat p atlantis is not the first case in which a filopodiated amoeba was misassigned to the nuclearia genera the amoeba capsaspora owczarzaki was previously described as well as a nuclearia until phylogenetic approaches placed capsaspora outside holomycota within holozoans its transcriptomic data is already available

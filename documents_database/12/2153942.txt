glucose instead of using the more energetically efficient respiratory pathway even in the presence of oxygen as a result of employing this metabolic strategy cells excrete or overflow metabolites like lactate acetate and ethanol incomplete oxidation of growth substrates yields less energy e g atp than complete oxidation through respiration and yet overflow metabolism known as the warburg effect in the context of cancer occurs ubiquitously among fast growing cells including bacteria fungi and mammalian cells based on experimental studies of acetate overflow in escherichia coli recent research has offered a general explanation for the association of overflow metabolism with fast growth according to this theory the enzymes required for respiration are more costly than those required for partial oxidation of glucose that is if the cell were to produce enough of these enzymes to support fast growth with respiratory metabolism it would consume much more energy carbon and nitrogen per unit time than supporting fast growth with an incompletely oxidative metabolism e g fermentation given that cells have limited energy resources and fixed physical volume for proteins there is thought to be a trade off between efficient energy capture through central metabolism i e respiration and fast growth achieved

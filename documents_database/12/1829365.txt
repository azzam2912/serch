department of energy doe the national solar thermal test facility nsttf is the only test facility of this type in the united states the nsttf s primary goal is to provide experimental engineering data for the design construction and operation of unique components and systems in proposed solar thermal electrical plants planned for large scale power generation the site was built and instrumented to provide test facilities for a variety of solar and non solar applications the facility can provide during the late 1970s rising fuel costs and the demand for a cleaner environment gave impetus to advance technology which used solar energy to create electricity studies identified the central receiver concept as having high potential to generate electricity on a large scale the united states government initiated support through the national science foundation research applied to national needs rann program in 1972 which was eventually funded by the energy research and development administration and the department of energy six central receiver pilot plants were constructed including the 5 mw thermal test facility at sandia national laboratories the heliostat field has 218 individual heliostats this capability directly supports the sunshot goals by providing flux levels of greater than 250 w

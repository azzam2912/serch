the tuft is structurally supported by the mesangium the space between the blood vessels made up of intraglomerular mesangial cells the blood is filtered across the capillary walls of this tuft through the glomerular filtration barrier which yields its filtrate of water and soluble substances to a cup like sac known as bowman s capsule the filtrate then enters the renal tubule of the nephron the glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal arterial circulation unlike most capillary beds the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules the resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration the glomerulus and its surrounding bowman s capsule constitute a renal corpuscle the basic filtration unit of the kidney the rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli and thus the measure of the overall kidney function is the glomerular filtration rate gfr the glomerulus is a tuft of small blood vessels called capillaries located within bowman s capsule within the kidney glomerular mesangial cells structurally support the tufts blood enters the capillaries of the glomerulus by a single arteriole called an afferent arteriole

this process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language as well as interbreeding with other hominins which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a web the study of human evolution involves several scientific disciplines including physical anthropology primatology archaeology paleontology neurobiology ethology linguistics evolutionary psychology embryology and genetics genetic studies show that primates diverged from other mammals about in the late cretaceous period and the earliest fossils appear in the paleocene around within the hominoidea apes superfamily the hominidae family diverged from the hylobatidae gibbon family some 15 20 million years ago african great apes subfamily homininae diverged from orangutans ponginae about the hominini tribe humans australopithecines and other extinct biped genera and chimpanzees parted from the gorillini tribe gorillas between 8 9 million years ago and in turn the subtribes hominina humans and biped ancestors and panina chimpanzees separated 4 7 million years ago human evolution from its first separation from the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is characterized by a number of morphological developmental physiological and behavioral changes the most significant of these adaptations are bipedalism increased brain size lengthened ontogeny gestation and infancy and decreased sexual dimorphism the

the stars involved are sufficiently far apart that it is improbable that any of them will individually collide some stars will be ejected from the resulting galaxy nicknamed milkomeda or milkdromeda the andromeda galaxy is approaching the milky way at about as indicated by blueshift however the lateral speed measured as proper motion is very difficult to measure with a precision to draw reasonable conclusions a lateral speed of only 7 7 km s would mean that the andromeda galaxy is moving toward a point 177 800 light years to the side of the milky way 7 7 km s 110 km s 2 540 000 ly and such a speed over an eight year timeframe amounts to only 1 3 000th of a hubble space telescope pixel hubble s resolution 0 05 arcsec 7 7 km s 300 000 km s 8 y 2 540 000 ly 180 3600 0 000017 arcsec until 2012 it was not known whether the possible collision was definitely going to happen or not in 2012 researchers concluded that the collision is sure using hubble to track the motion of stars in andromeda between 2002 and 2010 with sub pixel accuracy andromeda s tangential

bicoid was the first protein demonstrated to act as a morphogen although bicoid is important for the development of drosophila and other higher dipterans it is absent from most other insects where its role is accomplished by other genes bicoid mrna is actively localized to the anterior of the fruit fly egg during oogenesis along microtubules by the motor protein dynein and retained there through association with cortical actin translation of bicoid is regulated by its 3 utr and begins after egg deposition diffusion and convection within the syncytium produce an exponential gradient of bicoid protein within roughly one hour after which bicoid nuclear concentrations remain approximately constant through cellularization an alternative model proposes the formation of a bicoid mrna gradient in the embryo along cortical microtubules which then serves as template for translation of the bicoid protein to form the bicoid protein gradient bicoid protein represses the translation of caudal mrna and enhances the transcription of anterior gap genes including hunchback orthodenticle and buttonhead bicoid is one of the few proteins which uses its homeodomain to bind both dna and rna targets to regulate their transcription and translation respectively the nucleic acid binding homeodomain of bicoid has been solved

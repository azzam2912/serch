although it belongs to a subdivision called the inarticulata which have shells where the mineral content consist of calcium phosphate the craniidae have shells that consist of calcium carbonate other special characteristics of this family are that no outgrowths are developed to form a hinge between both valves nor is there any support for the lophophore as adults craniids either lived free on the ocean floor or more commonly were attached to a hard object with all or part of the ventral valve all other brachiopods are supposed to have a stalk or pedicle at least as an adolescent but in craniids a pedicle is not known from any development stage they are the only members of the order craniida and the monotypic suborder craniidina and superfamily cranioidea consequently the latter two taxa are presently redundant and not used very often valdiviathyris and neoancistrocrania were sometimes separated in a family valdiviathyrididae but this has turned out to be unjustified most craniidae are long extinct forms known only from fossils like all other craniforma however some 20 species of this 470 million year old lineage are surviving today they include valdiviathyris quenstedti which has remained essentially unchanged for the last 35

these populations may be separated by space and or time depending on the ecological conditions the interspecific interactions may be mutualistic antagonistic or even an arms race showing variation in specific traits over a broad geographical area in mutualisms both partners benefit from the interaction when both partners experience a decreased fitness it is an antagonistic relationship arms races consist of two species adapting ways to one up the other several factors affect these relationships including hot spots cold spots and trait mixing reciprocal selection occurs when a change in one partner puts pressure on the other partner to change in response hot spots are areas of strong reciprocal selection while cold spots are areas with no reciprocal selection or where only one partner is present the three constituents of geographic structure that contribute to this particular type of coevolution are natural selection in the form of a geographic mosaic hot spots often surrounded by cold spots and trait remixing by means of genetic drift and gene flow mosaic along with general coevolution most commonly occurs at the population level and is driven by both the biotic and the abiotic environment these environmental factors can constrain coevolution and affect how

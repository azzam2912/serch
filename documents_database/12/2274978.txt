it emerges as a timely storage solution to bridge the ever increasing performance gap between the processing speed of the compute nodes and the input output i o bandwidth of the storage systems burst buffer is built from arrays of high performance storage devices such as nvram and ssd it typically offers from one to two orders of magnitude higher i o bandwidth than the back end storage systems the emergence of burst buffer fosters a wide variety of burst buffer based solutions that accelerate the scientific data movement on supercomputers for example scientific applications life cycles typically alternate between computation phases and i o phases namely after each round of computation i e computation phase all the computing processes concurrently write their intermediate data to the back end storage systems i e i o phase followed by another round of computation and data movement operations with the deployment of burst buffer processes can quickly write their data to burst buffer after one round of computation instead of writing to the slow hard disk based storage systems and immediately proceed to the next round of computation without waiting for the data to be moved to the back end storage systems

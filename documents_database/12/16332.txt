it has two analog input terminals formula 1 and formula 2 and one binary digital output formula 3 the output is ideally a comparator consists of a specialized high gain differential amplifier they are commonly used in devices that measure and digitize analog signals such as analog to digital converters adcs as well as relaxation oscillators the differential voltages must stay within the limits specified by the manufacturer early integrated comparators like the lm111 family and certain high speed comparators like the lm119 family require differential voltage ranges substantially lower than the power supply voltages 15 v vs 36 v rail to rail comparators allow any differential voltages within the power supply range when powered from a bipolar dual rail supply or when powered from a unipolar ttl cmos power supply specific rail to rail comparators with p n p input transistors like the lm139 family allow the input potential to drop 0 3 volts below the negative supply rail but do not allow it to rise above the positive rail specific ultra fast comparators like the lmh7322 allow input signal to swing below the negative rail and above the positive rail although by a narrow margin of only 0

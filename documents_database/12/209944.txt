each time the tube was inverted or shaken the impact of the fluid at each end would sound like a hammer blow this is associated with increased stroke volume of the left ventricle and decrease in the peripheral resistance leading to the widened pulse pressure of aortic regurgitation to feel a water hammer pulse with the patient reclining the examiner raises the patient s arm vertically upwards the examiner grasps the muscular part of the patient s forearm a water hammer pulse is felt as a tapping impulse which is transmitted through the bulk of the muscles this happens because the blood that is pumped to the arm during systole is emptied very quickly due to the gravity effect on the raised arm this results in the artery emptying back into the heart during diastole increasing preload and therefore increasing cardiac output as per the law of laplace so that systolic blood pressure increases and a stronger pulse pressure can be palpated water hammer pulse is commonly found when a patient has aortic regurgitation it can also be seen in other conditions which are associated with a hyperdynamic circulation a more comprehensive list of causes follows watson s water hammer

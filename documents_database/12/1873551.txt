although widely used for a number of extinct physeterids with primitive dental morphology consisting of enameled teeth scaldicetus as generally recognized appears to be a wastebasket taxon filled with more or less unrelated primitive sperm whales scaldicetus is known from the miocene to pleistocene deposits of western europe the u s california florida maryland virginia baja peninsula peru new south wales and japan however scaldicetus is probably a grade taxon and fossil teeth assigned to it largely due to the lack of distinguishing characteristics in fossil teeth alone probably represent more or less unrelated sperm whales united by their primitive characteristics rather than actual ancestry consequently this would inflate the genus s distribution the name scaldicetus caretti was coined in 1867 from numerous sperm whale teeth collected in neogene deposits near antwerp belgium probably from the early to middle miocene bercham formation however some of these remains may have been reworked and redeposited into younger rocks more remains also near antwerp from the diest formation date to the tortonian late miocene synonyms of scaldicetus include palaeodelphis homocetus and eucetus the genus physodon described by french paleontologist paul gervais in 1872 was previously considered a synonym but it was declared a

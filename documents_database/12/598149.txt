it is commonly a hand held instrument with a microphone the diaphragm of the microphone responds to changes in air pressure caused by sound waves that is why the instrument is sometimes referred to as a sound pressure level spl meter this movement of the diaphragm i e the sound pressure deviation pascal pa is converted into an electrical signal volts v while describing sound in terms of sound pressure pascal is possible a logarithmic conversion is usually applied and the sound pressure level is stated instead with 0 db spl equal to 20 micropascals a microphone is distinguishable by the voltage value produced when a known constant sound pressure is applied this is known as the microphone sensitivity the instrument needs to know the sensitivity of the particular microphone being used using this information the instrument is able to accurately convert the electrical signal back to a sound pressure and display the resulting sound pressure level decibels db spl sound level meters are commonly used in noise pollution studies for the quantification of different kinds of noise especially for industrial environmental mining and aircraft noise the current international standard that specifies sound level meter functionality and performances is the

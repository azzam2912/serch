according to the theorem in a connected graph in which every vertex has at most neighbors the vertices can be colored with only colors except for two cases complete graphs and cycle graphs of odd length which require 1 colors the theorem is named after r leonard brooks who published a proof of it in 1941 a coloring with the number of colors described by brooks theorem is sometimes called a brooks coloring or a coloring for any connected undirected graph g with maximum degree the chromatic number of g is at most unless g is a complete graph or an odd cycle in which case the chromatic number is 1 gives a simplified proof of brooks theorem if the graph is not biconnected its biconnected components may be colored separately and then the colorings combined if the graph has a vertex v with degree less than then a greedy coloring algorithm that colors vertices farther from v before closer ones uses at most colors therefore the most difficult case of the proof concerns biconnected regular graphs with 3 in this case lov sz shows that one can find a spanning tree such that two nonadjacent neighbors u and w

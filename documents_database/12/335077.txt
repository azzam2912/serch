a geometric structure such as the euclidean plane is a complicated object that involves concepts such as length angles continuity betweenness and incidence an incidence structure is what is obtained when all other concepts are removed and all that remains is the data about which points lie on which lines even with this severe limitation theorems can be proved and interesting facts emerge concerning this structure such fundamental results remain valid when additional concepts are added to form a richer geometry it sometimes happens that authors blur the distinction between a study and the objects of that study so it is not surprising to find that some authors refer to incidence structures as incidence geometries incidence structures arise naturally and have been studied in various areas of mathematics consequently there are different terminologies to describe these objects in graph theory they are called hypergraphs and in combinatorial design theory they are called block designs besides the difference in terminology each area approaches the subject differently and is interested in questions about these objects relevant to that discipline using geometric language as is done in incidence geometry shapes the topics and examples that are normally presented it is however possible to

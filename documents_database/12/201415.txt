ap5 blocks nmda receptors in micromolar concentrations 50 m ap5 blocks the cellular analog of classical conditioning in the sea slug aplysia californica and has similar effects on aplysia long term potentiation ltp since nmda receptors are required for both it is sometimes used in conjunction with the calcium chelator bapta to determine whether nmdars are required for a particular cellular process ap5 apv has also been used to study nmdar dependent ltp in the mammalian hippocampus in general ap5 is very fast acting within in vitro preparations and can block nmda receptor action at a reasonably small concentration the active isomer of ap5 is considered to be the configuration although many preparations are available as a racemic mixture of and isomers it is useful to isolate the action of other glutamate receptors in the brain i e ampa and kainate receptors ap5 can block the conversion of a silent synapse to an active one since this conversion is nmda receptor dependent ap5 was developed by jeff watkins and harry olverman works cited laube b hirai h sturgess m betz h and kuhse j 1997 molecular determinants of antagonists discrimination by nmda receptor subunits analysis of the glutamate binding site

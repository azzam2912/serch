at room temperature and pressure another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form but diamond almost never converts to it diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material properties that are utilized in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools they are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the earth because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid few types of impurity can contaminate it two exceptions being boron and nitrogen small numbers of defects or impurities about one per million of lattice atoms color diamond blue boron yellow nitrogen brown defects green radiation exposure purple pink orange or red diamond also has relatively high optical dispersion ability to disperse light of different colors most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3 5 billion years most were formed at depths between in the earth s mantle although a few have come from as deep as under high pressure and temperature carbon containing fluids dissolved minerals and replaced them with diamonds much more recently tens to hundreds of million years ago they were carried to the surface

in fact the anatolian mountains resemble archipelagos like the famous galapagos islands since darwin we know that geographic isolation between islands or separated mountains is an important means of speciation leading to high spatial diversity for anatolia this assumption is conformed by concentrations of endemism on highly isolated and relatively old massifs such as uluda and ilgaz da whereas very young volcanic cones such as ercyes da and hassan da are surprisingly poor in endemics as local endemics take a long time to evolve we also have to compare the history of the central and north european mountains with the anatolian ones during each of the glacial periods the former were covered by thick shields of permanent ice which destroyed most pre glacial endemism and hindered neo endemics from forming only less glaciated peripheral areas the so called massifs de refuge offered suitable conditions for the survival of local endemics during glacial periods in anatolia the pleistocene glaciations only covered the highest peaks so there are many species with small ranges in other words anatolia as a whole is a big massif de refuge showing all degrees of past and recent speciation for a visitor from central europe climatic diversity

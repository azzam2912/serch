the n th partial sum of the fourier series has large oscillations near the jump which might increase the maximum of the partial sum above that of the function itself the overshoot does not die out as n increases but approaches a finite limit this sort of behavior was also observed by experimental physicists but was believed to be due to imperfections in the measuring apparatuses this is one cause of ringing artifacts in signal processing the gibbs phenomenon involves both the fact that fourier sums overshoot at a jump discontinuity and that this overshoot does not die out as more terms are added to the sum the three pictures on the right demonstrate the phenomenon for a square wave of height formula 1 whose fourier expansion is more precisely this is the function f which equals formula 1 between formula 4 and formula 5 and formula 6 between formula 5 and formula 8 for every integer n thus this square wave has a jump discontinuity of height formula 9 at every integer multiple of formula 10 as can be seen as the number of terms rises the error of the approximation is reduced in width and energy but converges

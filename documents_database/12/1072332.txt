oceanography and climatology are the science branches which study ocean heat content changes in the ocean heat content play an important role in the sea level rise because of thermal expansion it is with high confidence that ocean warming accounts for 90 of the energy accumulation from global warming between 1971 and 2010 about one third of that extra heat has been estimated to propagate to depth below 700 meters beyond the direct impact of thermal expansion ocean warming contributes to increased rates of ice melt of glaciers in fjords of greenland and ice sheets in antarctica warmer oceans are also responsible for coral bleaching the areal density of ocean heat content between two depth levels is defined using a definite integral formula 1 where formula 2 is seawater density formula 3 is the specific heat of sea water h2 is the lower depth h1 is the upper depth and formula 4 is the temperature profile in si units formula 5 has units of j m integrating this density over an ocean basin or entire ocean gives the total heat content as indicated in the figure to right thus the total heat content is the product of the density specific

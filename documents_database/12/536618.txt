a random deviate or simply deviate is the difference of random variate with respect to the distribution central location e g mean often divided by the standard deviation of the distribution random variates are used when simulating processes driven by random influences stochastic processes in modern applications such simulations would derive random variates corresponding to any given probability distribution from computer procedures designed to create random variates corresponding to a uniform distribution where these procedures would actually provide values chosen from a uniform distribution of pseudorandom numbers procedures to generate random variates corresponding to a given distribution are known as procedures for random variate generation or pseudo random number sampling in probability theory a random variable is a measurable function from a probability space to a measurable space of values that the variable can take on in that context those values are also known as random variates or random deviates and this represents a wider meaning than just that associated with pseudorandom numbers devroye defines a random variate generation algorithm for real numbers as follows the distinction between random variable and random variate is subtle and is not always made in the literature it is useful when one wants to

the boletes are the best known members of this group and until recently the boletales were thought to only contain boletes the boletales are now known to contain distinct groups of agarics gasteromycetes and other fruiting body types the order boletales originally was erected to describe boletes but based on micromorphological and molecular phylogenetic characteristics a large number of nonbolete species have recently been established to belong to this group as well the order also includes some gilled mushrooms in the families gomphidiaceae serpulaceae tapinellaceae hygrophoropsidaceae and paxillaceae which often have the same flesh texture as the boletes spore bearing tissue which is also easily separable from the cap and similar microscopic characteristics of spores and cystidia taxonomic studies using secondary metabolites and later molecular phylogenetic evidence moved several physically dissimilar groups into boletales including the sclerodermataceae earthballs and the rhizopogonaceae false truffles phylogenetic analyses shows the sclerodermataceae boletinellaceae and gyroporaceae appear to form a discrete group within the boletales and together with the pisolithaceae and the astraceae are grouped under the suborder sclerodermatineae thus the boletes of boletinellus and phlebopus are more closely related to earthballs of scleroderma than to boletus similarly the bolete genus suillus is more closely

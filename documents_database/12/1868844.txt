the search was designed to identify proteins which contained a sequence of amino acids called a voltage sensor because this sequence of amino acids confers voltage sensitivity to voltage gated ion channels although the initial genomic analysis was primarily concerned with the evolution of voltage gated ion channels one of the results of the work was the discovery of the vsp protein in sea squirt termed ci vsp the homologues to ci vsp in mammals are called transmembrane phosphatases with tensin homology or tptes tpte now also called hvsp2 and the closely related tpip also called tpte2 or hvsp1 were identified before the discovery of ci vsp however no voltage dependent activity was described in the initial reports of these proteins subsequently computational methods were used to suggest that these proteins may be voltage sensitive however ci vsp is still widely regarded as the first identified vsp vsps are found across animals and choanoflagellates though lost from nematodes and insects humans contain two members tpte and tpte2 which result from a primate specific duplication most reports indicate that vsps are found primarily in reproductive tissue especially the testis other vsps discovered include dr vsp zebrafish danio rerio 2008 gg vsp

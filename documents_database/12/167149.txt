that is it naturally oscillates with greater amplitude at some frequencies called resonant frequencies than at other frequencies the oscillations in a resonator can be either electromagnetic or mechanical including acoustic resonators are used to either generate waves of specific frequencies or to select specific frequencies from a signal musical instruments use acoustic resonators that produce sound waves of specific tones another example is quartz crystals used in electronic devices such as radio transmitters and quartz watches to produce oscillations of very precise frequency a cavity resonator is one in which waves exist in a hollow space inside the device in electronics and radio microwave cavities consisting of hollow metal boxes are used in microwave transmitters receivers and test equipment to control frequency in place of the tuned circuits which are used at lower frequencies acoustic cavity resonators in which sound is produced by air vibrating in a cavity with one opening are known as helmholtz resonators a physical system can have as many resonant frequencies as it has degrees of freedom each degree of freedom can vibrate as a harmonic oscillator systems with one degree of freedom such as a mass on a spring pendulums balance wheels and lc

twenty eight years later masdeu and colleagues described the presence of a mlr in humans it is now widely acknowledged that along with other motor control centers of the brain the mlr plays an active role in initiating and modulating the spinal neural circuitry to control posture and gait anatomically as the name suggests the mlr is located in the mesencephalon or midbrain ventral to the inferior colliculus and near the cuneiform nucleus although identifying the exact anatomical substrates of the mlr has been subject to considerable debate the pedunculopontine nucleus ppn lateral cuneiform nucleus and midbrain extrapyramidal area are thought to form the neuroanatomical basis of the mlr nuclei within the mlr receive inputs from the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia and neural centers within the limbic system projections from the mlr descend via the medullary and pontine reticulospinal tracts to act on spinal motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors the ppn within the mlr is composed of a diverse population of neurons containing the neurotransmitters gamma amino butyric acid gaba glutamate and acetylcholine ach results from animal and clinical studies suggest that cholinergic neurons in the ppn play a crucial role in

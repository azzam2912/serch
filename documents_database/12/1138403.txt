each floor is designed to rotate a maximum of per minute or one full rotation in 180 minutes it was proposed as the world s first prefabricated skyscraper with 40 factory built modules for each floor fisher said that 90 of the tower could be built in a factory and shipped to the construction site this would allow the entire building to be built more quickly the core of the tower must be built at the construction site fisher said that the prefabricated portions would decrease the project s cost and the number of workers and that construction will take 30 less time than a normal skyscraper of the same size the majority of the workers would be in factories working under safer conditions kitchen and bathroom fixtures would be pre installed the core would serve each floor with a special patented connection for clean water based on technology used to refuel airplanes in mid flight the entire tower is proposed to be powered from wind turbines and solar panels enough surplus electricity should be produced to power five other similar sized buildings in the vicinity the turbines would be located between each of the rotating floors fisher said that

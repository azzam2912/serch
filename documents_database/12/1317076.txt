it is a technique that can specifically label the newly synthesized copies of the genetically tagged protein the timestamp technique for labelling newly synthesized proteins of interest and is based on drug dependent preservation of epitope tags a simple diagram showing the strategy for drug dependent epitope tagging of newly synthesized proteins can be found here in this technique a tag that is present on all the proteins that are synthesized after the one time administration of a small molecule drug to achieve this goal specific protease activity is incorporated to confer self removing behaviour onto an epitope tag then a corresponding protease inhibitor is used in order to block the removal of the tag as a result only those proteins synthesized after the application of inhibitor would be tagged as timestamp technique can achieve temporally controlled labelling of newly synthesized proteins of interest even in thick tissues or intact animals and provide a sensitive specific detection the distribution of newly synthesized protein in a living animal can be studied

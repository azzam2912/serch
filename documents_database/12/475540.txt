floer homology is a novel invariant that arises as an infinite dimensional analogue of finite dimensional morse homology andreas floer introduced the first version of floer homology now called hamiltonian floer homology in his proof of the arnold conjecture in symplectic geometry floer also developed a closely related theory for lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold a third construction also due to floer associates homology groups to closed three dimensional manifolds using the yang mills functional these constructions and their descendants play a fundamental role in current investigations into the topology of symplectic and contact manifolds as well as smooth three and four dimensional manifolds floer homology is typically defined by associating to the object of interest an infinite dimensional manifold and a real valued function on it in the symplectic version this is the free loop space of a symplectic manifold with the symplectic action functional for the instanton version for three manifolds it is the space of su 2 connections on a three dimensional manifold with the chern simons functional loosely speaking floer homology is the morse homology of the function on the infinite dimensional manifold a floer chain complex is formed from the abelian group spanned by

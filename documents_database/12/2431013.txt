three examples were completed each different to the others when the design of the s 25 began in 1942 it was seen as a version of the two seat s 21 but the problem of providing a good view from the rear cockpit which was under the wing in the s 21 whilst keeping it close to the c g resulted in a serious change in wing plan and with it a change of designation though switzerland remained neutral during world war ii associated supply restrictions delayed the completion of the s 25 and its first flight was not made until june 1946 like the s 21 the s 25 has a high mounted strut braced gull wing apart from the revised plan the two aircraft s wings are similar in construction span and area both are built around a single spar with ply covering ahead of it forming a torsion resistant d box and have internal angled drag struts from the inner spar to the wing mounting on the upper fuselage which act also as the rear of longer chord d boxes externally the wings are braced with a single strut on each side from spar to the fuselage

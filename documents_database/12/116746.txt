he developed the concepts of tetravalent carbon atoms linking together to form large molecules and that the bonding order of the atoms in a molecule can be determined from chemical evidence couper was the only surviving son of a wealthy textile mill owner near glasgow he studied at the universities of glasgow and edinburgh and intermittently in germany during the years 1851 54 he began the formal study of chemistry at the university of berlin in the fall of 1854 then in 1856 entered charles adolphe wurtz s private laboratory at the faculty of medicine in paris now the couper published his new chemical theory in french in a condensed form on 14 june 1858 then in detailed papers simultaneously in french and english in august 1858 couper s idea that carbon atoms can link to each other following valence regularities was independent of a paper by august kekul proposing the same concept kekul had already proposed the tetravalence of carbon in 1857 however through a misunderstanding with wurtz kekul s paper appeared in print first in may 1858 and so kekul captured the priority for the discovery of the self linking of carbon atoms when couper angrily confronted wurtz

the strain was unofficially titled under its own species name until it was renamed to be an ecovariation of mycobacterium ulcerans the strain of m liflandii that has been isolated from anuran sources at the university of california berkeley has been designated kt1 kt1 is characterized and differentiated from its closest relatives mycobacterium ulcerans and mycobacterium marinum by the following molecular and physical traits restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp assay kt1 has a three base pair difference from m ulcerans and m marinum in its internal transcribed spacer its that results in a lack of a fok 1 restriction enzyme site that is present in m ulcerans and m marinum amplification of its followed by fok 1 digestion results in an rflp with a major product of 213 base pairs for both m ulcerans and m marinum and a product band of 266 base pairs for m liflandii the following additional comparative differences were also used to identify m liflandii kt1 1 kt1 is identical to m ulcerans in the 5 signature region of rna polymerase subunit b rpo b and one base pair off from m ulcerans in the 3 region it is three base pairs different from m

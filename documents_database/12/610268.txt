their chemical structure is defined by a 16 membered lactone ring scaffold bafilomycins exhibit a wide range of biological activity including anti tumor anti parasitic immunosuppressant and anti fungal activity the most used bafilomycin is bafilomycin a1 a potent inhibitor of cellular autophagy bafilomycins have also been found to act as ionophores transporting potassium k across biological membranes and leading to mitochondrial damage and cell death bafilomycin a1 specifically targets the vacuolar type h atpase v atpase enzyme a membrane spanning proton pump that acidifies either the extracellular environment or intracellular organelles such as the lysosome at higher micromolar concentrations bafilomycin a1 also acts on p type atpases which have a phosphorylated transitional state bafilomycin a1 serves as an important tool compound in many in vitro research applications however its clinical use is limited by a substantial toxicity profile bafilomycin a1 b1 and c1 were first isolated from streptomyces griseus in 1983 during a screen seeking to identify microbial secondary metabolites whose activity mimicked that of two cardiac glycosides bafilomycin c1 was identified as an inhibitor of p atpase with a k of 11 m bafilomycin c1 was found to have activity against caenorhabditis elegans ticks and tapeworms in addition

it is named after the british scientist w r dean who was the first to provide a theoretical solution of the fluid motion through curved pipes for laminar flow by using a perturbation procedure from a poiseuille flow in a straight pipe to a flow in a pipe with very small curvature if a fluid is moving along a straight pipe that after some point becomes curved the centripetal forces at the bend will cause the fluid particles to change their main direction of motion there will be an adverse pressure gradient generated from the curvature with an increase in pressure therefore a decrease in velocity close to the convex wall and the contrary will occur towards the outer side of the pipe this gives rise to a secondary motion superposed on the primary flow with the fluid in the centre of the pipe being swept towards the outer side of the bend and the fluid near the pipe wall will return towards the inside of the bend this secondary motion is expected to appear as a pair of counter rotating cells which are called dean vortices the dean number is typically denoted by de or dn for a flow

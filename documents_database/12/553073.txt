it is more properly known as passive intermodulation and can result from a variety of different causes such as ferromagnetic conduction metals or nonlinear microwave absorbers and loads corroded materials on antennas waveguides or even structural elements can act as one or more diodes crystal sets early radio receivers used the semiconductor properties of natural galena to demodulate the radio signal and copper oxide was used in power rectifiers this gives rise to undesired interference including the generation of harmonics or intermodulation rusty objects that should not be in the signal path including antenna structures can also reradiate radio signals with harmonics and other unwanted signals as with all out of band noise these spurious emissions can interfere with receivers this effect can cause radiated signals out of the desired band even if the signal into a passive antenna is carefully band limited the transfer characteristic of an object can be represented as a power series or taking only the first few terms which are most relevant for an ideal perfect linear object k k k k etc are all zero a good connection approximates this ideal case with sufficiently small values for a rusty bolt or an intentionally designed

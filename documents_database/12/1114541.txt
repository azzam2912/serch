the preselector is a band pass filter that blocks troublesome out of tune frequencies from passing through from the antenna into the radio receiver or preamplifier that otherwise would be directly connected to the antenna a preselector improves the performance of nearly any receiver but is especially helpful to receivers with broadband front ends that are prone to overload such as scanners and ordinary consumer market shortwave and am broadcast receivers however a preselector is of no benefit for receivers or preamps if they are fed from a narrow band source such as a tuned small loop antenna a preselector typically is tuned to have a narrow bandwidth centered on the receiver s operating frequency the preselector passes through the signal on the frequency it is tuned to unchanged or only slightly diminished but it reduces or removes off frequency signals cutting down or eliminating unwanted interference however a preselector does not remove interference on the same frequency that it and the receiver are both tuned to extra filtering can be useful because the first input stage front end of receivers contains at least one rf amplifier which has power limits dynamic range most radios front ends amplify all radio

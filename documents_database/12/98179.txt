the resulting object is called an object copy or simply copy of the original object copying is basic but has subtleties and can have significant overhead there are several ways to copy an object most commonly by a copy constructor or cloning copying is done mostly so the copy can be modified or moved or the current value preserved if either of these is unneeded a reference to the original data is sufficient and more efficient as no copying occurs objects in general store composite data while in simple cases copying can be done by allocating a new uninitialized object and copying all fields attributes from the original object in more complex cases this does not result in desired behavior the design goal of most objects is to give the resemblance of being made out of one monolithic block even though most are not as objects are made up of several different parts copying becomes nontrivial several strategies exist to treat this problem consider an object a which contains fields x more concretely consider if a is a string and x is an array of its characters there are different strategies for making a copy of a referred to as

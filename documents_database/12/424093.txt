the language is a functional superset of the ansi standard mumps programming language since cach is at its core a mumps implementation it can run ansi mumps routines with no change to appeal as a commercial product cach implements support for object oriented programming a macro preprocessing language embedded sql for ansi standard sql access to m s built in database procedure and control blocks using c like brace syntax procedure scoped variables and relaxed whitespace syntax limitations the language has private and public variables and globals global has a different meaning in this language than in most such variables are global across routines processes and sessions thus editing a global variable is making permanent and immediate changes to a system universal database which survives reboots etc the scope of a private variable is the local function the scope of a public variable is the entire process variables private and public may be single elements or complete multi dimensional arrays the great majority of cach s feature set is inherited from the ansi mumps standard see that article for details on how data is represented and the different ways a programmer can think about the data during development

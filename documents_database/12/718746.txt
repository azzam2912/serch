it can be considered as the limit of an n sided polygon as n approaches infinity the interior of a linear apeirogon can be defined by a direction order of vertices and defining half the plane as the interior this article describes an apeirogon in its linear form as a tessellation or partition of a line a regular apeirogon has equal edge lengths just like any regular polygon p its schl fli symbol is and its coxeter dynkin diagram is it is the first in the dimensional family of regular hypercubic honeycombs this line may be considered as a circle of infinite radius by analogy with regular polygons with great number of edges which resemble a circle in two dimensions a regular apeirogon divides the plane into two half planes as a regular apeirogonal dihedron the interior of an apeirogon can be defined by its orientation filling one half plane dually the apeirogonal hosohedron has digon faces and an apeirogonal vertex figure 2 a truncated apeirogonal hosohedron becomes a apeirogonal prism with each vertex bounded by two squares and an apeirogon an alternated apeirogonal prism is a apeirogonal antiprism with each vertex bounded by three triangles and an apeirogon the

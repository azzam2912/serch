the mineral was named after professor hans e suess it was discovered in 1982 during the chemical analysis of the north haig olivine pigeonite achondrite ureilite it is a cream white color in reflected light and ranges in size from 1 m blebs to elongated grains that can reach up to 0 45 cm in length this mineral belongs in the isometric crystal class the isometric class has crystallographic axes that are all the same length and each of the three axes perpendicular to the other two it is isotropic has a structural type of do3 and a crystal lattice of bif suessite is an isotropic mineral isotropism is defined as an optical property of a mineral that stays the same from whatever direction it is observed in thin section microscopy an isotropic mineral has only one refractive index this means that light that passes through the mineral is not split into two different directions but it passes through unchanged suessite as determined from the previous definition only has one index of refraction when keil fuchs and berkley first discovered the mineral they described it as having a relatively low optical relief but there was no determination of the index

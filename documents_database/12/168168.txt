it is an algebraic surface in three dimensional projective space defined by a single quaternary cubic polynomial which is homogeneous of degree 3 hence cubic cubic surfaces are del pezzo surfaces if formula 1 has homogeneous coordinates formula 2 then the set of points where is a cubic surface called the fermat cubic surface the clebsch surface is the set of points where cayley s nodal cubic surface is the set of points where the cayley salmon theorem states that a smooth cubic surface over an algebraically closed field contains 27 straight lines these can be characterized independently of the embedding into projective space as the rational lines with self intersection number 1 or in other words the 1 curves on the surface an eckardt point is a point where 3 of the 27 lines meet a smooth cubic surface can also be described as a rational surface obtained by blowing up six points in the projective plane in general position in this case general position means no three points are aligned and no six are on a conic section the 27 lines are the exceptional divisors above the 6 blown up points the proper transforms of the 15 lines

they have one of the highest energy densities of all batteries but they are not widely used because of problems with high anode cost and byproduct removal when using traditional electrolytes this has restricted their use to mainly military applications however an electric vehicle with aluminium batteries has the potential for up to eight times the range of a lithium ion battery with a significantly lower total weight aluminium air batteries are primary cells i e non rechargeable once the aluminium anode is consumed by its reaction with atmospheric oxygen at a cathode immersed in a water based electrolyte to form hydrated aluminium oxide the battery will no longer produce electricity however it is possible to mechanically recharge the battery with new aluminium anodes made from recycling the hydrated aluminium oxide such recycling would be essential if aluminium air batteries are to be widely adopted aluminium powered vehicles have been under discussion for some decades hybridisation mitigates the costs and in 1989 road tests of a hybridised aluminium air lead acid battery in an electric vehicle were reported an aluminium powered plug in hybrid minivan was demonstrated in ontario in 1990 in march 2013 phinergy released a video demonstration of

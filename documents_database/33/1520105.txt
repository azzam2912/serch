the aim is to reduce the effort required to set up a data integration system by relying on existing matching and mapping generation techniques and to improve the system in pay as you go fashion as it is used labor intensive aspects of data integration are postponed until they are absolutely needed traditionally data integration and data exchange systems have aimed to offer many of the purported services of dataspace systems dataspaces can be viewed as a next step in the evolution of data integration architectures but are distinct from current data integration systems in the following way data integration systems require semantic integration before any services can be provided hence although there is not a single schema to which all the data conforms and the data resides in a multitude of host systems the data integration system knows the precise relationships between the terms used in each schema as a result significant up front effort is required in order to set up a data integration system dataspaces shift the emphasis to a data co existence approach providing base functionality over all data sources regardless of how integrated they are for example a dataspace support platform dssp can provide keyword

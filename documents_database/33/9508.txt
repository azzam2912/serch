the deposit is estimated to be more than 1 300 billion barrels 190 billion m of bitumen an amount approximately equivalent to the world s estimated proven oil reserves raw bitumen has an extremely high viscosity and specific gravity between 8 and 10 api gravity at ambient temperatures and is unsuitable for direct use in conventional power stations orimulsion is made by mixing the bitumen with about 30 fresh water and a small amount of surfactant the result behaves similarly to fuel oil an alcohol based surfactant recently replaced the original phenol based version improving the transport properties of the fuel and eliminating the health concerns associated with the phenol group of surfactants as a fuel for electricity generation orimulsion has a number of attractive characteristics if there is a spill while shipping over water the mixture de emulsifies and the bitumen drops out of suspension it is a non newtonian fluid and if it is allowed to cool below 30 c it will set pumping becomes impossible and there is no way of restarting operations or the flow through the pipeline again orimulsion is currently used as a commercial boiler fuel in power plants worldwide e g japan italy

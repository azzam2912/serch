sodium bicarbonate rockets are often used in science classes to demonstrate principles of chemistry and physics in the experiment a film canister is filled with water an effervescent tablet commonly alka seltzer is added and the canister tightly sealed after a short time the pressure of the carbon dioxide is great enough to cause the body of the canister to be launched into the air with a popping sound the canister may be embellished with paper fins to resemble more closely a real rocket various experiments and lessons can center around the use of a bicarbonate rocket for example students are sometimes asked to experiment with the amounts of water and alka seltzer to find the combination which propels the rocket the greatest distance alternatively they may derive equations to calculate the speed and velocity of the rocket from the distance it travels in rocketry a chemical reaction rapidly creates gas that is expelled in one direction from its container the rocket engine momentum forces the rocket in the opposite direction the alka seltzer rocket experiment demonstrates newton s third law the film canister rocket has a buildup of gas that wants to come out of the weakest spot making

this is achieved by using reuse distance as a metric for dynamically ranking accessed pages to make a replacement decision the algorithm was developed by song jiang and xiaodong zhang while all page replacement algorithms rely on existence of reference locality to function a major difference among different replacement algorithms is on how this locality is qualified lirs uses reuse distance of a page or the number of distinct pages accessed between two consecutive references of the page to quantify locality specifically lirs uses last and second to last references if any for this purpose if a page is accessed for the first time its reuse distance is infinite in contrast lru uses recency of a page which is the number of distinctive pages accessed after the reference of the page to quantify locality to take into account of up to date access history the implementation of lirs actually uses the larger of reuse distance and recency of a page as the metric to quantify its locality denoted as rd r assuming the cache has a capacity of c pages the lirs algorithm is to rank recently accessed pages according to their rd r values and retain the c most

those that provide distributed energy sources the term is generally used in processes where the waves carry relatively low energy which is necessary for synchronization or switching the active medium in 1980 the soviet scientists g r ivanitsky v i krinsky a n zaikin a m zhabotinsky b p belousov became winners of the highest state award of the ussr for the discovery of a new class of autowave processes and the study of them in disturbance of stability of the distributed excitable systems the first who studied actively the self oscillations was academician aa andronov and the term auto oscillations in russian terminology was introduced by aa andronov in 1928 his followers from lobachevsky university further contributed greatly to the development of autowave theory the simplest autowave equations describing combustion processes have been studied by a n kolmogorov i e petrovsky in 1937 as well as by ya b zel dovich d a frank kamenetsky in 1938 the classical axiomatic model with autowaves in myocardium was published in 1946 by norbert wiener and arturo rosenblueth during 1970 80 major efforts to study autowaves were concentrated in the institute of biological physics of the ussr academy of sciences located in

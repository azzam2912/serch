these columns are located in the primary visual cortex v1 and span multiple cortical layers the geometry of the orientation columns are arranged in slabs that are perpendicular to the surface of the primary visual cortex in 1958 david hubel and torsten wiesel discovered cells in the visual cortex that had orientation selectivity this was found through an experiment by giving a cat specific visual stimuli and measuring the corresponding excitation of the neurons in striate cortex v1 the experimental set up was of a slide projector a cat electrodes and an electrode monitor they discovered this orientation selectivity when changing slides on the projector the act of changing the slides produced a faint shadow line across the projector and excited the neuron they were measuring at the time of this experiment it was not conclusive that these orientation selective cells were in a columnar structure but the possibility of this structure was considered by research conducted by vernon mountcastle in 1956 about the topographic properties of the somatosensory system in 1974 hubel and wiesel wrote a paper about the geometry of orientation columns they recorded 1410 cells in 45 penetrations into the striate cortex through this 1 dimensional technique

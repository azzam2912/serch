this reactive intermediate is of some importance to scientific research pyridynes are the class of compounds sharing the pyridyne building motif two isomers exist the 2 3 pyridine 2 3 didehydropyridine and the 3 4 pyridyne 3 4 didehydropyridine the reaction of 3 bromo 4 chloropyridine with furan and lithium amalgam gives 1 4 epoxy dihydroquinoline through the 2 3 pyridyne intermediate the reaction of 4 bromopyridine with sodium in liquid ammonia gives both 3 aminopyridine and 4 aminopyridine through the 3 4 pyridyne intermediate and an e1cb elimination reaction pyridynes were first postulated by levine and leake in 1955 in 1969 zoltewicz and nisi trapped 3 4 pyridyne in a reaction of 3 bromopyridine with methylmercaptan and sodium amide in ammonia the methylthio and amino pyridines were found to be formed in the same ratio in 1972 kramer and berry inferred the formation of 3 4 pyridyne in gas phase photolysis of pyridine 3 diazonium 4 carboxylate via time of flight mass spectrometry the dimer compound diazabiphenylene was detected in 1988 nam and leroy reported the matrix isolation 13k ar of 3 4 pyridyne by photolysis of 3 4 pyridinedicarboxylic anhydride with the ir spectrum revealing an acetylenic bond

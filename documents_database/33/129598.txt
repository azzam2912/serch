potassium sodium tartrate and monopotassium phosphate were the first materials discovered to exhibit piezoelectricity this property led to its extensive use in crystal gramophone phono pick ups microphones and earpieces during the post world war ii consumer electronics boom of the mid 20th century such transducers had an exceptionally high output with typical pick up cartridge outputs as much as 2 volts or more rochelle salt is deliquescent so any transducers based on the material deteriorated if stored in damp conditions it has been used medicinally as a laxative it has also been used in the process of silvering mirrors it is an ingredient of fehling s solution reagent for reducing sugars it is used in electroplating in electronics and piezoelectricity and as a combustion accelerator in cigarette paper similar to an oxidizer in pyrotechnics in organic synthesis it is used in aqueous workups to break up emulsions particularly for reactions in which an aluminium based hydride reagent was used sodium potassium tartrate is also important in the food industry it is a common precipitant in protein crystallography and is also an ingredient in the biuret reagent which is used to measure protein concentration this ingredient maintains cupric ions in

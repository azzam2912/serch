the equant is used to explain the observed speed change in planetary orbit during different stages of the orbit this planetary concept allowed ptolemy to keep the theory of uniform circular motion alive by stating that the path of heavenly bodies was uniform around one point and circular around another point the equant point shown in the diagram by the large is placed so that it is directly opposite to earth from the deferent s center known as the eccentric represented by the a planet or the center of an epicycle a smaller circle carrying the planet was conceived to move at a constant angular speed with respect to the equant in other words to a hypothetical observer placed at the equant point the epicycle s center indicated by the small would appear to move at a steady angular speed however the epicycle s center will not move at a constant speed along its deferent the reason for the implementation of the equant was to maintain a semblance of constant circular motion of celestial bodies a long standing article of faith originated by aristotle for philosophical reasons while also allowing for the best match of the computations of the observed

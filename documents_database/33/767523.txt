dda is somewhat similar to the finite element method for solving stress displacement problems but accounts for the interaction of independent particles blocks along discontinuities in fractured and jointed rock masses dda is typically formulated as a work energy method and can be derived using the principle of minimum potential energy or by using hamilton s principle once the equations of motion are discretized a step wise linear time marching scheme in the newmark family is used for the solution of the equations of motion the relation between adjacent blocks is governed by equations of contact interpenetration and accounts for friction dda adopts a stepwise approach to solve for the large displacements that accompany discontinuous movements between blocks the blocks are said to be simply deformable since the method accounts for the inertial forces of the blocks mass it can be used to solve the full dynamic problem of block motion although dda and dem are similar in the sense that they both simulate the behavior of interacting discrete bodies they are quite different theoretically while dda is a displacement method dem is a force method while dda uses displacement as variables in an implicit formulation with opening closing iterations

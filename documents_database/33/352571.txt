for example formula 1 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in two variables the sum of the exponents in each term is always 5 the polynomial formula 2 is not homogeneous because the sum of exponents does not match from term to term a polynomial is homogeneous if and only if it defines a homogeneous function an algebraic form or simply form is a function defined by a homogeneous polynomial a binary form is a form in two variables a form is also a function defined on a vector space which may be expressed as a homogeneous function of the coordinates over any basis a polynomial of degree 0 is always homogeneous it is simply an element of the field or ring of the coefficients usually called a constant or a scalar a form of degree 1 is a linear form a form of degree 2 is a quadratic form in geometry the euclidean distance is the square root of a quadratic form homogeneous polynomials are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics they play a fundamental role in algebraic geometry as a projective algebraic variety is defined as the set of the common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials

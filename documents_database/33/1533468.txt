the side made its second appearance in the play offs the first ending with the infamous 1992 semi finals 4 0 loss to the st george dragons whilst making the finals the season ultimately ended up as a disappointment losing in the first week to the gold coast chargers many expected them to win this match easily as they had beaten their opponents comfortably 28 6 the week before the steelers lost many players before the start of this season including veterans neil piccinelli david riolo brendan o meara and darren fritz leaving a massive hole to fill by many inexperienced juniors they gained only halfback hooker will robinson from souths the beginning of the season looked promising for the steelers with 4 wins 1 draw and 1 loss from the first six games sitting third on the ladder they failed to win any of their next seven games which included 2 draws the middle of season didn t suggest a good outcome for the end of the season to their credit however they won the next four out of five games and the final two games of the season when they knew a finals berth was on the line

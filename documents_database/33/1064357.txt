6 in a major op 82 1940 is a sonata for solo piano the first of the three war sonatas the sonata was first performed on 8 april 1940 in moscow the first movement introduces the main motto where the melody is played in minor thirds and parallel major thirds this makes the movement tonally unstable since both a major and a minor are established also the motto is accompanied by a rising and falling augmented 4th between notes a and d creating sharp dissonances thus it already introduces the uncertainty of the work the greater part of it is dominated by grinding dissonances and frequent modulation further increasing the despair of the work throughout most of the piece there is a lack of key signature the second movement has been described as having a march like sound with staccato chords there is also a very bouncy and jaunty character to the outer sections of the piece as well the middle section is more melodic and a little more pensive the third movement is similar to a waltz slower and romantic the closing movement is a rondo containing material from the opening movement

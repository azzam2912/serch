in particular this physics can be studied with dedicated detector at higher statistics for this purpose the snd was constructed with many improvements relative to nd experimental program of the snd is presented in ref and consists of items as follow the snd and its upgraded version are described in refs and respectively the detector design is illustrated in the r view and 3 d plot of the nai tl calorimeter segmentation unique features of the snd and its sensitivity to the neutral particles are defined by the state of art nai tl calorimeter data collected in the snd experiment from 1995 to 2000 corresponds to the integrated luminosity 30 pb spread in the energy range 2e 0 4 1 4 gev review of results of this experiment is presented in refs and results are included in the pdg review complete list of publications from snd also covers recent results of the experiment in the energy range 2e 1 0 2 0 gev started in 2009

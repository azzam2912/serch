it is a noninvasive test performed on small amounts of tissue removed during the original surgery lumpectomy mastectomy or core biopsy directhit was developed by ccc diagnostics inc a biotechnology company established by former researchers from johns hopkins university directhit was launched on 14 january 2010 currently it is the only available test for predicting treatment outcomes for anticancer chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer directhit is based on quantitative immunofluorescence technology according to recent studies quantitative immunofluorescence qif can be applied to the standardization of protein analysis resulting in increased sensitivity and reproducibility it is important to be able to quantitate the expression of predictive factors in breast cancer because response to therapy is often dependent upon the concentration of particular proteins within the tissue directhit utilizes monoclonal antibodies mab corresponding to each biomarker to stain the tumor tissue samples slides are evaluated with a computerized fluorescence microscopy system digital images are acquired through a cccd camera an algorithm was developed to process and analyze the digital images allowing direct relation between the amount of a specific protein within the cancer cells of the tumor and response to the corresponding drug quantitative measurement of up to five signals in a

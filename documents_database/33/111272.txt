it is one of the few known ways of catalyzing nuclear fusion reactions muons are unstable subatomic particles they are similar to electrons but are about 207 times more massive if a muon replaces one of the electrons in a hydrogen molecule the nuclei are consequently drawn 196 times closer than in a normal molecule due to the reduced mass being 196 times the mass of an electron when the nuclei are this close together the probability of nuclear fusion is greatly increased to the point where a significant number of fusion events can happen at room temperature current techniques for creating large numbers of muons require far more energy than would be produced by the resulting catalyzed nuclear fusion reactions moreover each muon has about a 1 chance of sticking to the alpha particle produced by the nuclear fusion of a deuteron with a triton removing the stuck muon from the catalytic cycle meaning that each muon can only catalyze at most a few hundred deuterium tritium nuclear fusion reactions these two factors prevent muon catalyzed fusion from becoming a practical power source limiting it to a laboratory curiosity to create useful room temperature muon catalyzed fusion reactors would

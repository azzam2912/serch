angyal s biospheric model of personality was found to have greater generality beyond the domain of personality to a broader range of systems angyal coined the word biosphere the word refers to both the individual and the environment not as interacting parts not as constituents which have independent existence but as aspects of a single reality which can be separated only by abstraction the biosphere is seen as a system of interlocking systems so arranged that any given sub system of the biosphere is both the container of lesser systems and the contained of a greater system or systems the interplay of the interlocking systems creates a tension which gives rise to the energy which is available to the personality moreover the biosphere as a whole is characterized by a fundamental polarity which gives rise to its most fundamental energy this polarity arises from the fact that the environment pulls in one direction and the organism in the other to these fundamental yet opposed pulls of the biosphere angyal has given the names of autonomy and homonomy respectively autonomy is the relatively egoistic pole of the biosphere it represents the tendency to advance one s interests by mastering the environment

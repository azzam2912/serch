in this case n is called an elementary substructure of m if every first order formula a a with parameters a a from n is true in n if and only if it is true in m if n is an elementary substructure of m m is called an elementary extension of n an embedding h n m is called an elementary embedding of n into m if h n is an elementary substructure of m a substructure n of m is elementary if and only if it passes the tarski vaught test every first order formula x b b with parameters in n that has a solution in m also has a solution in n when evaluated in m one can prove that two structures are elementary equivalent with the ehrenfeucht fra ss games two structures m and n of the same signature are elementarily equivalent if every first order sentence formula without free variables over is true in m if and only if it is true in n i e if m and n have the same complete first order theory if m and n are elementarily equivalent one writes m n a first order theory is complete

a pair of b zout coefficients can be computed by the extended euclidean algorithm if both a and b are nonzero the extended euclidean algorithm produces one of the two pairs such that formula 1 and formula 2 equality may occur only if one of a and b is a multiple of the other many other theorems in elementary number theory such as euclid s lemma or chinese remainder theorem result from b zout s identity a b zout domain is an integral domain in which b zout s identity holds in particular b zout s identity holds in principal ideal domains every theorem that results from b zout s identity is thus true in all these domains when one pair of b zout coefficients has been computed e g using extended euclidean algorithm all pairs can be represented in the form where is an arbitrary integer and the fractions simplify to integers among these pairs of b zout coefficients exactly two of them satisfy and equality may occur only if one of and divides the other this relies on a property of euclidean division given two integers c and d if d does not divide c there is exactly

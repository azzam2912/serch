it has been responsible for many major earthquakes and is one of the most seismically active fault zones in this part of china the xianshuihe fault system lies within the complex zone of continental collision between the indian plate and the eurasian plate it forms one of a set of sinistral fault zones that help accommodate the eastward spreading of the tibetan plateau the fault zone defines the northern and eastern edges of the sichuan yunnan block the xianshuihe fault system comprises several distinct segments with an overall length of about 350 km the main segments are the ganzi or ganzi yushu the xianshuihe the anninghe zemuhe and the xiaojiang faults movements on this fault system have been responsible for many large historical earthquakes with more than 20 events of magnitude greater than 6 5 since 1700 some of these earthquakes have formed linked sequences with each event being triggered by the previous one due to stress changes like the san andreas fault in california the xianshuihe exhibits a behavior called aseismic creep the xianshuihe fault creeps at a rate of a few mm yr between earthquakes

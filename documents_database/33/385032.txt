while the first three are regular tables psycho broke new ground it is connected to the others by activating certain jumpers then launching the ball into one of the tents and the ball continues in the other table returning to drop from the tent in psycho when it drains it is also the only one with a spring ball launcher and no multiball presumably because of the potential for one of the balls to transition between tables wild west is an open table with few obstacles this makes it very difficult to make high scores unlike trick or treat which is a much more enclosed table but with more ramp multipliers the abyss is the only one with two levels of play and the multiball is usually reduced to 2 balls to activate the multiball the player has to trap a ball in one of the vents holes and then knock it out of its trajectory when it is being thrown from one hole to another it is possible although difficult to trap additional balls in the vents and eventually have more balls in the multiball one of the main features of the game are the minigames on each table

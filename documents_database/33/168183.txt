the retractability allows the centreboard to be raised to operate in shallow waters to move the centre of lateral resistance offsetting changes to the sailplan that move the centre of effort aft to reduce drag when the full area of the centreboard is not needed or when removing the boat from the water as when trailering a centreboard which consists of just a pivoting metal plate is called a centerplate a daggerboard is similar but slides vertically rather than pivoting the analog in a scow is a bilgeboard these are fitted in pairs and used one at a time lt john schank c 1740 6 february 1823 was an officer of the british royal navy and is credited with the invention of the centerboard schank however gave credit for the idea to british brigadier general earl percy a centreboard often called a lifting foil in a modern racing dinghy is used to provide lift to counter the lateral force from the sails this is required for sailboats to move in directions other than downwind since the force of the sail is never closer than 45 degrees to the apparent wind since most sailboats are symmetric along their axis of motion

an rg 6 u coaxial cable has a characteristic impedance of 75 ohms the term rg 6 is generic and is applied to a wide variety of cable designs which differ from one another in shielding characteristics center conductor composition dielectric type and jacket type rg was originally a unit indicator for bulk radio frequency rf cable in the u s military s joint electronics type designation system the suffix u means for general utility use the number was assigned sequentially the rg unit indicator is no longer part of the jetds system mil std 196e and cable sold today under the rg 6 label is unlikely to meet military specifications in practice the term rg 6 is generally used to refer to coaxial cables with an 18awg 1 024mm center conductor and 75ohm characteristic impedance a common type of 75 ohm coaxial cable is cable television catv distribution coax used to route cable television signals to and within homes catv distribution coax typically has a copper clad steel ccs center conductor and a combination aluminum foil aluminum braid shield typically with low coverage about 60 75 ohm cables are also used in professional video applications carrying either base band

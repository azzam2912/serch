the result of the hit or miss transform is the set of positions where the first structuring element fits in the foreground of the input image and the second structuring element misses it completely in binary morphology an image is viewed as a subset of a euclidean space formula 1 or the integer grid formula 2 for some dimension d let us denote this space or grid by e a structuring element is a simple pre defined shape represented as a binary image used to probe another binary image in morphological operations such as erosion dilation opening and closing let formula 3 and formula 4 be two structuring elements satisfying formula 5 the pair c d is sometimes called a composite structuring element the hit or miss transform of a given image a by b c d is given by where formula 7 is the set complement of a that is a point x in e belongs to the hit or miss transform output if c translated to x fits in a and d translated to x misses a fits the background of a let formula 8 and consider the eight composite structuring elements composed of and the three rotations

the distinguished point is just simply one particular point picked out from the space and given a name such as x that remains unchanged during subsequent discussion and is kept track of during all operations maps of pointed spaces based maps are continuous maps preserving basepoints i e a map f between a pointed space x with basepoint x and a pointed space y with basepoint y is a based map if it is continuous with respect to the topologies of x and y and if f x y this is usually denoted pointed spaces are important in algebraic topology particularly in homotopy theory where many constructions such as the fundamental group depend on a choice of basepoint the pointed set concept is less important it is anyway the case of a pointed discrete space pointed spaces are often taken as a special case of the relative topology where the subset is a single point thus much of homotopy theory is usually developed on pointed spaces and then moved to relative topologies in algebraic topology the class of all pointed spaces forms a category top with basepoint preserving continuous maps as morphisms another way to think about this category is

absorption is complete by 90 days and full tensile strength remains for at least 7 days this eventual disintegration makes it good for use in rapidly healing tissues and in internal structures that cannot be re accessed for suture removal catgut suture has high knot pull tensile strength and good knot security due to special excellent handling features it is used for all surgical procedures including general closure ophthalmic orthopedics obstetrics gynecology and gastrointestinal surgery it is absorbed faster in patients with cancer anemia and malnutrition it also absorbed faster when used in the mouth and the vagina due to the presence of microorganisms catgut has largely been replaced by synthetic absorbable polymers such as vicryl and polydioxanone it is not used at all for human surgery in some countries in europe and japan gut sutures have been banned due to concerns that they could transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease although the herds from which gut is harvested are certified bse free catgut suture is made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from the serosal or submucosal layer of the small intestine of healthy ruminants cattle sheep goats or from beef tendon the natural plain thread

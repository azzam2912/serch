the aggregation problem is the difficult problem of finding a valid way to treat an empirical or theoretical aggregate as if it reacted like a less aggregated measure say about behavior of an individual agent as described in general microeconomic theory examples of aggregates in micro and macroeconomics relative to less aggregated counterparts are standard theory uses simple assumptions to derive general and commonly accepted results such as the law of demand to explain market behavior an example is the abstraction of a composite good it considers the price of one good changing proportionately to the composite good that is all other goods if this assumption is violated and the agents are subject to aggregated utility functions restrictions on the latter are necessary to yield the law of demand the aggregation problem emphasizes franklin fisher notes that this has not dissuaded macroeconomists from continuing to use such concepts the aggregate consumer demand curve is the summation of the individual consumer demand curves the aggregation process preserves only two characteristics of individual consumer preference theory continuity and homogeneity aggregation introduces three additional non price determinants of demand thus if the population of consumers increases ceteris paribus the demand curve will shift

glucose is then exported from the cell via glucose transporter membrane proteins this catalysis completes the final step in gluconeogenesis and therefore plays a key role in the homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels glucose 6 phosphatase is a complex of multiple component proteins including transporters for g6p glucose and phosphate the main phosphatase function is performed by the glucose 6 phosphatase catalytic subunit in humans there are three isozymes of the catalytic subunit glucose 6 phosphatase encoded by g6pc igrp encoded by g6pc2 and glucose 6 phosphatase encoded by g6pc3 glucose 6 phosphatase and glucose 6 phosphatase are both functional phosphohydrolases and have similar active site structure topology mechanism of action and kinetic properties with respect to g6p hydrolysis in contrast igrp has almost no hydrolase activity and may play a different role in stimulating pancreatic insulin secretion although a clear consensus has not been reached a large number of scientists adhere to a substrate transport model to account for the catalytic properties of glucose 6 phosphatase in this model glucose 6 phosphatase has a low degree of selectivity the transfer of the glucose 6 phosphate is carried out by a transporter protein t1 and the endoplasmic reticulum er

the engines are similar to the rotax powerplant in being liquid cooled two cylinder in line engines with dual capacitor discharge ignition the 3502 was developed from the 3503 as a de rated version and produces in comparison to the 3503 s both engines have the same bore stroke and compression ratio as the three cylinder in line liquid cooled hirth 3701 and the bore stroke compression ratio and displacement of the twin cylinder hirth 2704 and hirth 2706 both the 3502 and 3503 are equipped with dual bing 34 mm slide carburetors or optionally electronic fuel injection the cylinder walls are electrochemically coated with nikasil and the crankshaft is forged from 4130 steel standard starting is recoil start with electric start as an option the reduction drive system available is the g 50 gearbox with reduction ratios of 2 16 1 2 29 1 2 59 1 3 16 1 or 3 65 1 the engines run on a 50 1 pre mix of unleaded 93 octane auto fuel and oil or optionally oil injection

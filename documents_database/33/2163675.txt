together with sara sara solimana and coropuna it forms one of the central andean volcanoes it is in the andes north of the pucuncho basin two domes form the firura volcano which has a low relief of lava flows and stratovolcanoes form a long field aside from the main summit firura there also are soncco orcco jahsaya and separating firura from solimana antapuna the complex has generated basaltic or basaltic andesite lava flows that reach down into inhabited areas as well as an ignimbrite resulting from the collapse of the ancient crater date of last volcanic activity is pleistocene to holocene but it doesn t appear to be a major hazard much of the southern side of the volcano above altitude is covered with perennial snow a small glacier is found on the southern summit of firura and reaches down to this glacier appears to be located above the local equilibrium line altitude firura has well preserved moraine systems a major moraine system with a relief of was left by the last glacial maximum although expansion of glaciers on the northern flank was constrained on a high plateau the prevalent aridity of the climate impedes the degradation of these moraines

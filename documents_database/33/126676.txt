most of these lie in or are closely adjacent to mount tehama s caldera bumpass hell is the most spectacular of these but others of importance are sulphur works little hot springs valley boiling springs lake and devil s kitchen in each thermal area the highest temperature of water generally is close to the boiling temperature at the altitude of the particular spring or fumarole at bumpass hell and on the northwest flanks of lassen peak nps lassen volcanic national park nature science volcanoes lava flows temperatures as high as have been recorded in the park spring activity varies with water supply abundant water results in clear springs during early summer but as the season progresses and the water supply decreases springs change successively to turbid warm pools spattering mudpots and finally steaming fumaroles there are no true geysers within lassen volcanic national park gases from hot springs are composed mostly of steam and carbon dioxide with minor amounts of other gases these react with the rocks around the springs to ultimately form opal if temperature and acidity are high or kaolin if they are low deposits of sulfur pyrite quartz and other substances are also found around the springs

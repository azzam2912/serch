the function and contents of maurer s clefts are not completely known however they appear to play a role in trafficking of plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 pfemp1 and other adhesins to the red blood cell surface maurer s clefts appear in the cytosol of red blood cells 2 to 4 hours after invasion by p falciparum they originally appear as small membrane bound vacuoles likely originating from the parasitophorous vacuole membrane however as the parasite ages maurer s clefts expand to form single flattened cisternae 500 nanometers wide in parasite strains lacking the protein rex1 maurer s clefts instead appear as stacks of cisternae similar to stacks of golgi bodies for the first half of the parasite life cycle maurer s clefts are highly mobile in the host cytoplasm however as parasites transition to the trophozoite stage maurer s clefts become fixed in place this fixation coincides with pfemp1 appearing on the host cell surface the structures tethering maurer s clefts to the host cell membrane are visible by transmission electron microscopy as cylindrical structures 200 300 nanometers long and 30 nanometers wide the structure of these tethers is poorly defined but they appear to contain the parasite

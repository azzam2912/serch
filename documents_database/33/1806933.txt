normal three dimensional crystals have a repeating pattern in space but remain unchanged as time passes time crystals repeat themselves in time as well leading the crystal to change from moment to moment a time crystal never reaches thermal equilibrium as it is a type of non equilibrium matter a form of matter proposed in 2012 and first observed in 2017 this state of matter cannot be isolated from its environment it is an open system in non equilibrium the idea of a time crystal was first described by nobel laureate frank wilczek in 2012 later work developed a more precise definition for time crystals it was proven that they cannot exist in equilibrium then in 2014 krzysztof sacha predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically driven many body system and in 2016 norman yao et al proposed a different way to create time crystals in spin systems from there christopher monroe and mikhail lukin independently confirmed this in their labs both experiments were published in nature in 2017 the idea of a space time crystal was first put forward by frank wilczek a professor at mit and nobel laureate in 2012 in 2013 xiang zhang a

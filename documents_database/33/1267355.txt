winmor will complement the pactor modes in the high frequency portion of the winlink system winmor debuted at the 2008 arrl tapr digital communications conference unlike pactor ii iii only a simple computer soundcard to radio interface is required as compared to pactor s relatively expensive external terminal node controller it has two modes either 500 or 1600 hertz in bandwidth and provides arq speeds ranging from 67 to at least 1300 bits per second similar to pactor s various modes it is fully documented and without restrictions or license issues preventing anyone from using the protocol in other software winmor supports both connected arq and fec broadcast modes operational peer to peer on air beta testing of winmor began on 17 september 2009 deployment of rms winmor servers for the winlink system began in january 2010 500 hz bandwidth uses 2 carriers 1600 hz bandwidth uses 8 carriers each carrier uses 46 875 baud 4fsk or 93 75 baud psk using trellis coded modulation with 4 8 or 16 phases

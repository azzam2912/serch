although it seemed an improbable project the finished aircraft proved to be capable of meeting its design objectives although orders were never forthcoming from the military a total of 12 prototypes were built between 1956 and 1959 and testing continued until 1972 when the project was finally cancelled the original concept of an all fabric inflatable aircraft was based on taylor mcdaniel s inflatable rubber glider experiments in 1931 designed and built in only 12 weeks the goodyear inflatoplane was built in 1956 with the idea that it could be used by the military as a rescue plane to be dropped in a hardened container behind enemy lines the 44 cubic ft 1 25 cubic meter container could also be transported by truck jeep trailer or aircraft the inflatable surface of this aircraft was actually a sandwich of two rubber type materials connected by a mesh of nylon threads forming an i beam when the nylon was exposed to air it absorbed and repelled water as it stiffened giving the aircraft its shape and rigidity structural integrity was retained in flight with forced air being continually circulated by the aircraft s motor this continuous pressure supply enabled the aircraft to

the two theories are not identical but they agree at low energies more precisely under a renormalization group flow they flow to the same ir fixed point and so are in the same universality class it was first presented in seiberg s 1994 article electric magnetic duality in supersymmetric non abelian gauge theories it is an extension to nonabelian gauge theories with n 1 supersymmetry of montonen olive duality in n 4 theories and electromagnetic duality in abelian theories seiberg duality is an equivalence of the ir fixed points in an n 1 theory with su n as the gauge group and n flavors of fundamental chiral multiplets and n flavors of antifundamental chiral multiplets in the chiral limit no bare masses and an n 1 chiral qcd with n n colors and n flavors where n and n are positive integers satisfying a stronger version of the duality relates not only the chiral limit but also the full deformation space of the theory in the special case in which the ir fixed point is a nontrivial interacting superconformal field theory for a superconformal field theory the anomalous scaling dimension of a chiral superfield formula 3 where r is the

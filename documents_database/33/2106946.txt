deliberate solar observation began thousands of years ago that initial era of direct observation gave way to telescopes in the 1600s followed by satellites in the twentieth century stratigraphic data suggest that solar cycles have occurred for hundreds of millions of years if not longer measuring varves in precambrian sedimentary rock has revealed repeating peaks in layer thickness corresponding to the cycle it is possible that the early atmosphere on earth was more sensitive to solar irradiation than today so that greater glacial melting and thicker sediment deposits could have occurred during years with greater sunspot activity this would presume annual layering however alternative explanations diurnal have also been proposed analysis of tree rings revealed a detailed picture of past solar cycles dendrochronologically dated radiocarbon concentrations have allowed for a reconstruction of sunspot activity covering 11 400 years solar activity and related events have been regularly recorded since the time of the babylonians in the 8th century bc they described solar eclipses and possibly predicted them from numerological rules the earliest extant report of sunspots dates back to the chinese book of changes the phrases used in the book translate to a dou is seen in the sun and a

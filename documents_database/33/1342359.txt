many have elaborate antennal structures and body parts flattened paussines are moderate sized 6 20 mm characterised by glandular hairs that produce secretions attractive to ants and by the odd antennal structures of many species their pygidial glands can produce explosive secretions giving them the other name of flanged bombardier beetles although they are not particularly close relatives of the typical bombardier beetles brachininae very little is known about the immature stages of ant nest beetles most appear to live in ant nests in their early stages of life although many are facultative or obligate myrmecophiles most do not appear like ants i e myrmecomorphic and unlike in the case of myrmecophilous larval lycaenidae there appears to be no benefit gained by the ants in this association many species follow the trails of worker ants of specific species glandular secretions on their antennae and body allow them to interact with ant workers it is believed that the beetles use an acoustic mechanism to successfully imitate the sounds of an ant queen thus permitting them access to the nest without alarming the ants the defensive bombardier behaviour is never used against ants males of some species are attracted to lights during

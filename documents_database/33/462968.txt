it is occasionally called a side about the right angle the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse in the context of the hypotenuse the catheti are sometimes referred to simply as the other two sides if the catheti of a right triangle have equal lengths the triangle is isosceles if they have different lengths a distinction can be made between the minor shorter and major longer cathetus the ratio of the lengths of the catheti defines the trigonometric functions tangent and cotangent of the acute angles in the triangle the ratio formula 1 is the tangent of the acute angle adjacent to formula 2 and is also the cotangent of the acute angle adjacent to formula 3 in a right triangle the length of a cathetus is the geometric mean of the length of the adjacent segment cut by the altitude to the hypotenuse and the length of the whole hypotenuse by the pythagorean theorem the sum of the squares of the lengths of the catheti is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse the term leg in addition to referring to a cathetus of a right triangle is also used to refer to either

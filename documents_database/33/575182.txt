it is a method for correlating changes in the oscillation frequency of a piezoelectric crystal with the mass deposited on it he simultaneously developed a method for measuring the characteristic frequency and its changes by using the crystal as the frequency determining component of an oscillator circuit his method continues to be used as the primary tool in quartz crystal microbalance qcm experiments for conversion of frequency to mass and is valid in nearly all applications the equation is derived by treating the deposited mass as though it were an extension of the thickness of the underlying quartz because of this the mass to frequency correlation as determined by sauerbrey s equation is largely independent of electrode geometry this has the benefit of allowing mass determination without calibration making the set up desirable from a cost and time investment standpoint the sauerbrey equation is defined as where the normalized frequency formula 3 is the nominal frequency shift of that mode divided by its mode number most software outputs normalized frequency shift by default because the film is treated as an extension of thickness sauerbrey s equation only applies to systems in which the following three conditions are met the deposited

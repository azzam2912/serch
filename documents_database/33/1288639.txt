electric current is passed through a targeted soil volume between subsurface electrode elements the resistance to electrical flow that exists in the soil causes the formation of heat resulting in an increase in temperature until the boiling point of water at depth is reached after reaching this temperature further energy input causes a phase change forming steam and removing volatile contaminants erh is typically more cost effective when used for treating contaminant source areas three phase heating see technology below was originally created to enhance oil recovery this design was patented in 1976 by bill pritchett of arco the patent has expired and is now available for public use six phase heating see technology below was created and patented for the us department of energy doe in the 1980s for use on doe sites as well as commercial applications electrical resistance heating is used by the environmental restoration industry for remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater erh consists of constructing electrodes in the ground applying alternating current ac electricity to the electrodes and heating the subsurface to temperatures that promote the evaporation of contaminants volatilized contaminants are captured by a subsurface vapor recovery system and conveyed to the surface along

corn syrup also known as glucose syrup to confectioners is used in foods to soften texture add volume prevent crystallization of sugar and enhance flavor corn syrup is distinct from high fructose corn syrup hfcs which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme d xylose isomerase thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose the more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup since glucose syrup in the united states is most commonly made from corn starch technically glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono di and higher saccharides and can be made from any source of starch wheat tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources historically corn syrup was produced by combining corn starch with dilute hydrochloric acid and then heating the mixture under pressure the process was invented by the german chemist gottlieb kirchhoff in 1812 currently corn syrup is obtained through a multi step bioprocess first the enzyme amylase is added to a mixture of corn starch and water amylase is secreted by various species of the bacterium genus bacillus and the enzyme is isolated

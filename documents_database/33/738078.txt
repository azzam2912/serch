it is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types including the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex and zona fasciculata as well as gonadal tissues this gene encodes a member of the cytochrome p450 superfamily of enzymes the cytochrome p450 proteins are generally regarded as monooxygenases that catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol steroids and other lipids including the remarkable carbon carbon bond scission catalyzed by this enzyme this protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum it has both 17 hydroxylase and 17 20 lyase activities and is a key enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway that produces progestins mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids androgens and estrogens more specifically cyp17a1 acts upon pregnenolone and progesterone to add a hydroxyl oh group at carbon 17 of the steroid d ring the hydroxylase activity or acts upon 17 hydroxyprogesterone and 17 hydroxypregnenolone to split the side chain off the steroid nucleus the lyase activity the cyp17a1 gene also contains one of 27 snps associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease the cyp17a1 gene resides on chromosome 10 at the band 10q24 3 and contains 8 exons the cdna of this gene spans a length of 1527 bp cyp17a1 is a

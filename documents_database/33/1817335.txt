it is developed at the computer science department of the university of l aquila dually enables the transformation of a model conforming to a specific architecture description language into corresponding models conforming to other architecture description languages as highlighted in the official iso iec ieee 42010 website the use of multiple views for design can get very complicated their consistency is a potential problem whenever multiple models and views are used sometimes consistency rules or procedures are defined as a part of viewpoints in other cases organizations have practices they use to check and enforce consistency the solution provided by the iso iec ieee 42010 standard consists in using correspondences and correspondence rules to define the various relationships that may exist within an architecture description under this perspective dually can be seen as an approach in which special kinds of correspondence rules can keep in a consistent state architecture models belonging to different views those special correspondence rules are defined between adls and have the additional feature of being proactive that is when an inconsistency is detected between different architectural models the dually interoperability engine actively transforms the models in order to restore consistency supporting adls interoperability and change propagation

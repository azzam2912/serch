it was devised in the 1930s but soon became obsolete the convention is of the type where one partner bids four notrump as an artificial inquiry and the other partner shows high cards aces and kings using an agreed set of codified responses the blackwood convention and its variants have since the 1930s been the best known example of this type in the blackwood convention family aces and in many variants the king of the agreed suit also are treated as equal the san francisco convention uses a different approach responder to four notrump allots three points to each ace held and one point to each king adds those values up and bids thus some of the responses are ambiguous for example 5 may show either zero or one or two kings and 5 may show either one ace or three kings other responses are precise for example 5 can only show one ace and two kings the ambiguity may often be more apparent than real but that and the imprecision of the responses as regards the location of high cards and the space consuming nature of the stronger responses may be among the reasons why san francisco was supplanted

it is designed for a class of complicated systems in which one observes evolution at a macroscopic coarse scale of interest while accurate models are only given at a finely detailed microscopic level of description the framework empowers one to perform macroscopic computational tasks over large space time scales using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and small length scales the methodology eliminates the derivation of explicit macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form hence the term equation free in a wide range of chemical physical and biological systems coherent macroscopic behavior emerges from interactions between microscopic entities themselves molecules cells grains animals in a population agents and with their environment sometimes remarkably a coarse scale differential equation model such as the navier stokes equations for fluid flow or a reaction diffusion system can accurately describe macroscopic behavior such macroscale modeling makes use of general principles of conservation atoms particles mass momentum energy and closed into a well posed system through phenomenological constitutive equations or equations of state however one increasingly encounters complex systems that only have known microscopic fine scale models in such cases although we observe the emergence

zero speed switches mainly use electromechanical electronic or magnetic proximity technologies electromechanical speed switches are direct coupled speed indicating devices which open or close a set of contacts mechanically as a function of the rotational speed of the switch shaft electronic zero speed switches are direct coupled speed indicating devices that open or close a set of contacts through a relay and electronic circuit user defined settings and the rotational input speed of the shaft determine the speed at which an electronic zero speed switch trips a small timing delay may be required for avoiding nuisance tripping during running as well as during starting of the machine this is taken care of in the electronics of the zss zero speed switches differ in terms of performance specifications mounting styles and features important specifications include operating range or the input shaft speed trip set point operating temperature range operating conditions field adjustability operating voltage and relay contact rating for various applications zero speed switch suppliers can provide zero speed switches that are explosion proof weather proof or dust proof there are two types of zss based on power supply provision one is the interrupted power type in which the power supply

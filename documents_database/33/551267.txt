for instance an osculating plane to a space curve is a plane that has second order contact with the curve this is as high an order as is possible in the general case in one dimension analytic curves are said to osculate at a point if they share the first three terms of their taylor expansion about that point this concept can be generalized to superosculation in which two curves share more than the first three terms of their taylor expansion

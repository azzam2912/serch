the types of cells found in the hypodermis are fibroblasts adipose cells and macrophages the hypodermis is derived from the mesoderm but unlike the dermis it is not derived from the dermatome region of the mesoderm in arthropods the hypodermis is an epidermal layer of cells that secretes the chitinous cuticle the term also refers to a layer of cells lying immediately below the epidermis of plants the hypodermis is beneath the dermis which is beneath the epidermis it is used mainly for fat storage a layer of tissue lies immediately below the dermis of vertebrate skin it is often referred to as subcutaneous tissue though this is a less precise and anatomically inaccurate term the hypodermis consists primarily of loose connective tissue and lobules of fat it contains larger blood vessels and nerves than those found in the dermis in some animals such as whales and hibernating mammals the hypodermis forms an important insulating layer and or food store in some plants the hypodermis is a layer of cells immediately below the epidermis of leaves it is often mechanically strengthened for example in pine leaves forming an extra protective layer or a water storage tissue subcutaneous fat is the

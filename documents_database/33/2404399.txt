testacea species are specialist fruit flies that breed on the fruiting bodies of mushrooms these flies will choose to breed on psychoactive mushrooms such as the fly agaric amanita muscaria drosophila neotestacea can be found in temperate regions of north america ranging from the north eastern united states to western canada drosophila neotestacea and other mushroom breeding drosophila have been studied extensively for their interactions with howardula nematode parasites particularly howardula aoronymphium unlike related species d neotestacea is sterilized by h aoronymphium infection the genetic basis of this susceptibility is unknown and is nematode dependent for instance a related howardula species from japan does not sterilize d neotestacea even though the european and north american howardula species do moreover the related drosophila orientacea is resistant to infection by the european howardula nematodes but susceptible to the japanese howardula nematodes accordingly nematode infection strongly suppresses genes involved in egg development comparisons between d neotestacea and nematode resistant members of the testacea species group can help tease apart interactions of fly immunity genetics and nematode parasitism genetics initially discovered in d neotestacea mushroom feeding flies are commonly infected with the trypanosomatid parasite jaenimonas drosophilae the major innate immunity pathways of drosophila are

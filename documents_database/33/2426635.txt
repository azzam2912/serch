year of the snake will undoubtedly challenge those familiar with turner grenadier and ballard s work in intrinsically accessible contexts the guardian s john fordham awarded the album 4 stars noting the new york trio fly is an exchange between equals not a sax led charge over a rhythm section though it falls into the territory sometimes dubbed chamber jazz year of the snake is up there with fly s best work with its rustling fast grooves and languid horn lines and pieces that open on almost impossibly pure high register long tones in jazztimes thomas conrad observed that fly plays cerebral rapt interactive chamber jazz deriving a wide range of textures and colors from three instruments mark turner often ascends to the tenor s piping keening altissimo register larry grenadier often plays arco bass in drones and murmurs and sighs the asymmetrical spare designs of drummer jeff ballard imply time rather than keep it the music of fly is sophisticated and sincere and enormously competent these are important virtues but likely to inspire more admiration than love all compositions by jeff ballard larry grenadier and mark turner except where noted

slag is usually a mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide however slags can contain metal sulfides and elemental metals while slags are generally used to remove waste in metal smelting they can also serve other purposes such as assisting in the temperature control of the smelting and minimizing any re oxidation of the final liquid metal product before the molten metal is removed from the furnace and used to make solid metal in some smelting processes such as ilmenite smelting to produce titanium dioxide the slag is the valuable product instead of the metal in nature iron copper lead nickel and other metals are found in impure states called ores often oxidized and mixed in with silicates of other metals during smelting when the ore is exposed to high temperatures these impurities are separated from the molten metal and can be removed slag is the collection of compounds that are removed in many smelting processes oxides are introduced to control the slag chemistry assisting in the removal of impurities and protecting the furnace refractory lining from excessive wear in this case the slag is termed synthetic a good example is steelmaking slag quicklime and magnesite are introduced for refractory

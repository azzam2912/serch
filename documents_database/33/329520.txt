more one has by the chain rule for all formula 14 in formula 15 for real analytic functions unlike for complex analytic that is holomorphic functions these statements fail to hold for example consider the function given by x x this function is clearly injective but its derivative is 0 at x 0 and its inverse is not analytic or even differentiable on the whole interval 1 1 consequently if we enlarge the domain to an open subset g of the complex plane it must fail to be injective and this is the case since for example f f where is a primitive cube root of unity and is a positive real number smaller than the radius of g as a neighbourhood of 0

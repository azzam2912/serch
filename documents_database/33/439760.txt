the main body of the song is a 50s progression with time signature in 6 8 commonly heard in doo wop songs such as stand by me progressing from c major to a minor then f major to g major played softly on piano and synthesiser the first half of the lyrics are sung by david gilmour in a gentle tone beginning with mama loves her baby and a refrain of ooh babe ooh baby blue a bass guitar creates a dissonant effect mid song when it plays an f against an a minor the major sixth of the chord and the augmented fourth of the key then roger waters takes over the lead vocal the piano becomes staccato as the lyric takes on a warning tone with waters singing if you should go skating on the thin ice of modern life as the lyrics end the diatonic sense of c major is abandoned as the melody heard earlier e d f e and a becomes stripped to a simple power chord riff played loud by distorted guitars with brief soloing the song ends on a sustained c major chord but through crossfading with the next song on the album

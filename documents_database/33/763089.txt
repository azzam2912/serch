informally this means that there is only one type of edge to the object given two edges there is a translation rotation and or reflection that will move one edge to the other while leaving the region occupied by the object unchanged the term isotoxal is derived from the greek meaning arc an isotoxal polygon is an equilateral polygon but not all equilateral polygons are isotoxal the duals of isotoxal polygons are isogonal polygons in general an isotoxal 2n gon will have d nn dihedral symmetry a rhombus is an isotoxal polygon with d 22 symmetry all regular polygons equilateral triangle square etc are isotoxal having double the minimum symmetry order a regular n gon has d nn dihedral symmetry a regular 2 n gon is an isotoxal polygon and can be marked with alternately colored vertices removing the line of reflection through the mid edges regular polyhedra are isohedral face transitive isogonal vertex transitive and isotoxal quasiregular polyhedra are isogonal and isotoxal but not isohedral their duals are isohedral and isotoxal but not isogonal not every polyhedron or 2 dimensional tessellation constructed from regular polygons is isotoxal for instance the truncated icosahedron the familiar soccerball has two types of

it operates on the principle of the sagnac effect which shifts the nulls of the internal standing wave pattern in response to angular rotation interference between the counter propagating beams observed externally results in motion of the standing wave pattern and thus indicates rotation the first experimental ring laser gyroscope was demonstrated in the us by macek and davis in 1963 various organizations worldwide subsequently developed ring laser technology further many tens of thousands of rlgs are operating in inertial navigation systems and have established high accuracy with better than 0 01 hour bias uncertainty and mean time between failures in excess of 60 000 hours ring laser gyroscopes can be used as the stable elements for one degree of freedom each in an inertial reference system the advantage of using an rlg is that there are no moving parts apart from the dither motor assembly see further description below and laser lock compared to the conventional spinning gyroscope this means there is no friction which in turn eliminates a significant source of drift additionally the entire unit is compact lightweight and highly durable making it suitable for use in aircraft and also satellites unlike a mechanical gyroscope the device

there are four fundamental interactions known to exist the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions which produce significant long range forces whose effects can be seen directly in everyday life and the strong and weak interactions which produce forces at minuscule subatomic distances and govern nuclear interactions some scientists hypothesize that a fifth force might exist but the hypotheses remain speculative each of the known fundamental interactions can be described mathematically as a field the gravitational force is attributed to the curvature of spacetime described by einstein s general theory of relativity the other three are discrete quantum fields and their interactions are mediated by elementary particles described by the standard model of particle physics within the standard model the strong interaction is carried by a particle called the gluon and is responsible for quarks binding together to form hadrons such as protons and neutrons as a residual effect it creates the nuclear force that binds the latter particles to form atomic nuclei the weak interaction is carried by particles called w and z bosons and also acts on the nucleus of atoms mediating radioactive decay the electromagnetic force carried by the photon creates electric and magnetic fields which are responsible for

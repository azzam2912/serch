one example of cellular respiration creating cellular waste products are aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration each pathway generates different waste products when in the presence of oxygen cells use aerobic respiration to obtain energy from glucose molecules simplified theoretical reaction cho 6o 6co 6ho 30atp cells undergoing aerobic respiration produce 6 molecules of carbon dioxide 6 molecules of water and up to 30 molecules of atp adenosine triphosphate which is directly used to produce energy from each molecule of glucose in the presence of surplus oxygen in aerobic respiration oxygen serves as the recipient of electrons from the electron transport chain aerobic respiration is thus very efficient because oxygen is a strong oxidant aerobic respiration proceeds in a series of steps which also increases efficiency since glucose is broken down gradually and atp is produced as needed less energy is wasted as heat this strategy results in the waste products ho and co being formed in different amounts at different phases of respiration co is formed in pyruvate decarboxylation ho is formed in oxidative phosphorylation and both are formed in the citric acid cycle the simple nature of the final products also indicates the efficiency of this method of respiration

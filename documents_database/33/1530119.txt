because of its weakly coordinating abilities lithium tetrakis pentafluorophenyl borate makes it commercially valuable in the salt form in the catalyst composition for olefin polymerization reactions and in electrochemistry it is a water soluble compound its anion is closely related to the non coordinating anion known as barf the tetrakis pentafluorophenyl borates have the advantage of operating on a one to one stoichiometric basis with group iv transition metal polyolefin catalysts unlike methylaluminoxane mao which may be used in large excess the anion is tetrahedral with b c bond lengths of approximately 1 65 angstroms the salt has only been obtained as the etherate and the crystallography confirms that four ether oet molecules are bound to the lithium cation with li o bond lengths of approximately 1 95 angstroms the li oet complex is tetrahedral the salt was first produced in studies on tris pentafluorophenyl boron a well known lewis acidic compound combining equimolar ether solutions of pentafluorophenyllithium and tris pentafluorophenyl boron gives the lithium salt of tetrakis pentafluorophenyl borate which precipitates as a white solid as the etherate since its discovery many revised syntheses have been described lithium tetrakis pentafluorophenyl borate is primarily used to prepare cationic transition metal

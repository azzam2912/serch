injection of insulin in pulses mimics the physiological secretions of insulin by the pancreas into the portal vein which then drains into the liver in healthy non diabetic individuals pancreatic secretions of insulin correspond to the intake of food the pancreas will secrete variable amounts of insulin based upon the amount of food consumed basically speaking the more food that is consumed the more insulin the pancreas will secrete among other factors continuous exposure to insulin and glucagon is known to decrease the hormones metabolic effectiveness on glucose production in humans due to the body developing an increased tolerance to the hormones down regulation at the cellular level may partially explain the decreased action of steady state levels of insulin while pulsatile hormone secretion may allow recovery of receptor affinity and numbers for insulin intermittent intravenous insulin administration with peaks of insulin concentrations may enhance suppression of gluconeogenesis and reduce hepatic glucose production dr thomas aoki former head of metabolism research at the joslin diabetes center in boston massachusetts and a former professor of medicine at the university of california davis led the field as a pioneer of using pulsatile insulin in the treatment of diabetes dr aoki s work

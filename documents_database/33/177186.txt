however the first locomotive to be built to the design was actually ds1173 in 1948 which served as a departmental shunter at hither green depot before being transferred to the capital stock list as d2341 in 1967 the class 04 locomotives were supplied by the drewry car co which at the time and for most of its existence had no manufacturing capability drewry sub contracted the construction work to two builders both of whom built other locomotives under the same arrangement early locomotives including ds1173 were built by vulcan foundry and later examples were built by robert stephenson and hawthorns a clear line of development can be seen in the class 04s from the 0 4 0dm locomotives built by andrew barclay and drewry vulcan foundry in the early 1940s the design continued to develop during the construction period but this was generally confined to the size of the cab windows and the diameter of the wheels similar locomotives had been built before the first class 04 and others were built for industrial use the first four of these locomotives 11100 3 later d2200 3 were fitted with side skirting and cowcatchers for use on the wisbech and upwell tramway

the two simplest of these are called series and parallel and occur frequently components connected in series are connected along a single conductive path so the same current flows through all of the components but voltage is dropped lost across each of the resistances in a series circuit the sum of the voltages consumed by each individual resistance is equal to the source voltage components connected in parallel are connected along multiple paths so that the current can split up the same voltage is applied to each component a circuit composed solely of components connected in series is known as a series circuit likewise one connected completely in parallel is known as a parallel circuit in a series circuit the current that flows through each of the components is the same and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the individual voltage drops across each component in a parallel circuit the voltage across each of the components is the same and the total current is the sum of the currents flowing through each component consider a very simple circuit consisting of four light bulbs and a 12 volt automotive battery if a wire joins the battery to one

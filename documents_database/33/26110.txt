some chemical compounds made from petroleum are also obtained from other fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas or renewable sources such as corn palm fruit or sugar cane the two most common petrochemical classes are olefins including ethylene and propylene and aromatics including benzene toluene and xylene isomers oil refineries produce olefins and aromatics by fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum fractions chemical plants produce olefins by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane aromatics are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha olefins and aromatics are the building blocks for a wide range of materials such as solvents detergents and adhesives olefins are the basis for polymers and oligomers used in plastics resins fibers elastomers lubricants and gels global ethylene and propylene production are about 115 million tonnes and 70 million tonnes per annum respectively aromatics production is approximately 70 million tonnes the largest petrochemical industries are located in the usa and western europe however major growth in new production capacity is in the middle east and asia there is substantial inter regional petrochemical trade primary petrochemicals are divided into three groups depending on their chemical structure in 2007 the amounts of ethylene and propylene produced

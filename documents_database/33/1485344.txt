intuitively this concept measures how close a digraph is to a directed acyclic graph dag in the sense that a dag has cycle rank zero while a complete digraph of order n with a self loop at each vertex has cycle rank n the cycle rank of a directed graph is closely related to the tree depth of an undirected graph and to the star height of a regular language it has also found use in sparse matrix computations see and logic the cycle rank r g of a digraph is inductively defined as follows the tree depth of an undirected graph has a very similar definition using undirected connectivity and connected components in place of strong connectivity and strongly connected components cycle rank was introduced by in the context of star height of regular languages it was rediscovered by as a generalization of undirected tree depth which had been developed beginning in the 1980s and applied to sparse matrix computations the cycle rank of a directed acyclic graph is 0 while a complete digraph of order n with a self loop at each vertex has cycle rank n apart from these the cycle rank of a few other digraphs

in the work written entirely in latin kepler discusses harmony and congruence in geometrical forms and physical phenomena the final section of the work relates his discovery of the so called third law of planetary motion it is estimated that kepler had begun working on harmonices mundi sometime near 1599 which was the year kepler sent a letter to michael maestlin detailing the mathematical data and proofs that he intended to use for his upcoming text which he originally planned to name de harmonia mundi kepler was aware that the content of harmonices mundi closely resembled that of the subject matter for ptolemy s harmonica but was not concerned because the new astronomy kepler would use most notably the adoption of elliptic orbits in the copernican system allowed him to explore new theorems another important development that allowed kepler to establish his celestial harmonic relationships was the abandonment of the pythagorean tuning as the basis for musical consonance and the adoption of geometrically supported musical ratios this would eventually be what allowed kepler to relate musical consonance and the angular velocities of the planets thus kepler could reason that his relationships gave evidence for god acting as a grand geometer

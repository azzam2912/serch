in that sense the software acts as a basic framework for research applications any university research group or individual in the world is authorized to take the source code modify it and release it under gplv3 for further use in the aeronautical community the idea behind this experimental way of working is that those who use the software for practical applications can directly benefit from what researchers are achieving so that their results can be directly put into practice one of the key features of open vogel is that it provides built in tools intended to facilitate the creation of geometrical models each component is defined in a parametric way and the software resolves the geometry to generate a suitable mesh optimized for the calculation core open vogel currently allows three types of models slender lifting surfaces closed fuselages and jet engine nacelles tubular cylinders slender surfaces are bounded lattices specifically intended to simulate wings the actual model can be viewed as a paper sheet but their behavior approaches very well to that of thin wings open vogel employs this kind of surfaces because they require less than a half of the number of panels required to generate a full

stone spaces are named after marshall harvey stone who introduced and studied them in the 1930s in the course of his investigation of boolean algebras which culminated in his representation theorem for boolean algebras the following conditions on the topological space x are equivalent important examples of stone spaces include finite discrete spaces the cantor set and the space z of p adic integers where p is any prime number generalizing these examples any product of finite discrete spaces is a stone space and the topological space underlying any profinite group is a stone space the stone ech compactification of the natural numbers with the discrete topology or indeed of any discrete space is a stone space to every boolean algebra b we can associate a stone space s b as follows the elements of s b are the ultrafilters on b and the topology on s b is generated by the sets of the form f s b b f where b is an element of b stone s representation theorem for boolean algebras states that every boolean algebra is isomorphic to the boolean algebra of clopen sets of the stone space s b and furthermore every stone space

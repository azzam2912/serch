it describes the influence each response value has on each fitted value the diagonal elements of the projection matrix are the leverages which describe the influence each response value has on the fitted value for that same observation if the vector of response values is denoted by formula 3 and the vector of fitted values by formula 4 as formula 4 is usually pronounced y hat the projection matrix is also named hat matrix as it puts a hat on formula 3 the formula for the vector of residuals formula 8 can also be expressed compactly using the projection matrix where formula 10 is the identity matrix the matrix formula 11 is sometimes referred to as the residual maker matrix moreover the element in the i th row and j th column of formula 1 is equal to the covariance between the j th response value and the i th fitted value divided by the variance of the former therefore the covariance matrix of the residuals formula 8 by error propagation equals where formula 16 is the covariance matrix of the error vector and by extension the response vector as well for the case of linear models with independent and

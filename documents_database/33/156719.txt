thyroglobulin protein accounts for approximately half of the protein content of the thyroid gland human tg htg is a homodimer of subunits each containing 2768 amino acids as synthesized a short signal peptide may be removed from the n terminus in the mature protein thyroglobulin is a precursor to thyroid hormones which are produced when thyroglobulin s tyrosine residues are combined with iodine and the protein is subsequently cleaved each thyroglobulin molecule contains approximately 100 120 tyrosine residues but only a small number 20 of these are subject to iodination by thyroperoxidase in the follicular colloid therefore each tg molecule forms approximately 10 thyroid hormone molecules thyroglobulin tg acts as a substrate for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine t4 and triiodothyronine t3 as well as the storage of the inactive forms of thyroid hormone and iodine within the follicular lumen of a thyroid follicle newly synthesized thyroid hormones t3 and t4 are attached to thyroglobulin and comprise the colloid within the follicle when stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone tsh the colloid is endocytosed from the follicular lumen into the surrounding thyroid follicular epithelial cells the colloid is subsequently cleaved by proteases to release thyroglobulin from its t3 and

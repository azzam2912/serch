if the pair formula 3 were to satisfy newton s second law the right hand side of the second equation would have to be which is typically not the same as if for example the potential formula 2 is cubic i e proportional to formula 7 then formula 8 is quadratic proportional to formula 9 this means in the case of newton s second law the right side would be in the form of formula 10 while in the ehrenfest theorem it is in the form of formula 11 the difference between these two quantities is the square of the uncertainty in formula 12 and is therefore nonzero an exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear that is when formula 13 is quadratic and formula 8 is linear in that special case formula 15 and formula 16 do agree thus for the case of a quantum harmonic oscillator the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories for general systems if the wave function is highly concentrated around a point formula 17 then formula 15 and formula 16 will be almost the same since both will be approximately equal to formula 20

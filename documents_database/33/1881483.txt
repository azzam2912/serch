the star is not particularly noteworthy with exception to its enormously high heavy element content hd 108063 is a somewhat bright star that lies in an area of the southern sky towards the middle of centaurus it has not been studied particularly extensively but was identified as modestly high proper motion star during the previous century with a hipparcos parallax of 18 5 mas it lies at a distance of 54 parsecs so the star is fairly nearby the relative brightness of the star at its distance means that it is substantially over luminous compared to a dwarf star and as of such it has been previously classified as a g5iii or g4iv star on the hertzsprung russell diagram left the star lies on the subgiant branch confirming that it is over luminous the star s b v colour indicates a spectral type of f9 5 while the spectroscopic effective temperature indicates a spectral type closer to f9 determination of the metallicity of hd 108063 has only been made more recently with the first value made photometrically in 2004 their fe h of 0 66 dex is slightly higher than the spectroscopic value of fe h 0 55 0 06

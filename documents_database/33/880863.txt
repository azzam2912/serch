it was designed in the 1940s without the use of a computer the fundamental details of the machine were published in von neumann s book theory of self reproducing automata completed in 1966 by arthur w burks after von neumann s death von neumann s goal was to specify an abstract machine which when run would replicate itself in his design the machine consists of three parts a blueprint for itself a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine sans blueprint specified by that blueprint and a copy machine that can make copies of any blueprint after the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint and this copy is placed into the new machine resulting in a working replication of the original machine some machines will do this backwards copying the blueprint and then building a machine to define his machine in more detail von neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton the one he used consists of a two dimensional grid of cells each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time

it was first reported due to its high proper motion in 2010 by j d kirkpatrick et al it was then independently discovered from its x ray radiation on june 10 2015 further investigation has shown the star to be a binary star with components of spectral type m6 5 and m8 they orbit each other in 1 400 1 800 years and reached their closest point in mid 1968 assuming a constant proper motion during their closest approach they were separated by less than 0 1 arcsecond compared to their current separation of 2 arcseconds despite the fact that a and b are magnitude 12 5 and 13 respectively their vicinity to the earth was not noticed until 2015 due to the fact that it is in front of a relatively dense star field less than 15 degrees away from the galactic center 2mass j1835a is likely a flare star due to its clear x ray radiation common of flare stars it has never been observed to flare directly however a 19th magnitude star at has been seen in the vicinity with a similar proper motion to 2mass j1835 but is probably not related as its proper motion is

although it played many roles in ibm s system 360 lineup it accounted for a small fraction of a percent of the 360 systems sold five model 75 computers housed at nasa s real time computer complex were used during the apollo program three models the h75 i75 and j75 were respectively configured with one two or four ibm 2365 model 3 processor storage units each of which provided 262 144 256k bytes of core memory so that the h75 had 262 144 256k bytes of core the i75 had 524 288 512k and the j75 1 048 576 1 mb the high performance of the model 75 was attributed to half a dozen advanced features including parallel arithmetic overlapped memory fetch and parallel addition for address calculation furthermore independent storage sections provided two way h75 or four way i75 j75 interleaving of memory access even with only two way interleaving an effective sequential access rate of 400 nanoseconds per double word eight bytes is possible the model 75 implements the complete system 360 universal instruction set architecture including floating point decimal and character operations as standard features

smith at oregon state university in 2009 it is the first inorganic blue pigment discovered in 200 years since cobalt blue was identified in 1802 the compound has a unique trigonal bipyramidal structure and further research has discovered it can be modified to create green purple and orange pigments in 2008 subramanian received a national science foundation grant to explore novel materials for electronics applications under this project he was particularly interested in synthesizing multiferroics based on manganese oxides he directed andrew e smith a graduate student in his lab to synthesize an oxide solid solution between a ferroelectric material and an antiferromagnetic material at the resulting compound was not an effective multiferroic it was instead a vibrant blue material because of subramanian s experience at dupont he recognized the compound s potential use as a blue pigment and filed a patent disclosure covering the invention after publishing their results shepherd color company successfully contacted subramanian for possible collaboration in commercialization efforts the pigment is noteworthy for its vibrant near perfect blue color and unusually high nir reflectance the color can be adjusted by varying the in mn ratio in the pigment s base formula of but the bluest pigment

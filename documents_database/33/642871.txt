this condition can occur for a number of reasons the simplest of which is when the system has a lower number of actuators than degrees of freedom in this case the system is said to be trivially underactuated the class of underactuated mechanical systems is very rich and includes such diverse members as automobiles airplanes and even animals to understand the mathematical conditions which lead to underactuation one must examine the dynamics that govern the systems in question newton s laws of motion dictate that the dynamics of mechanical systems are inherently second order in general these dynamics can be described by a second order differential equation formula 1 where formula 2 is the position state vector formula 3 is the vector of control inputs formula 4 is time furthermore in many cases the dynamics for these systems can be rewritten to be affine in the control inputs formula 5 when expressed in this form the system is said to be underactuated if formula 6 when this condition is met there are acceleration directions that can not be produced no matter what the control vector is note that formula 7 does not explicitly represent the number of actuators present in

antibubbles are formed when liquid drops or flows turbulently into the same or another liquid they can either skim across the surface of a liquid such as water in which case they are also called water globules or they can be completely submerged into the liquid to which they are directed antibubbles are a common but widely unrecognized phenomenon in part because of their resemblance to air bubbles and in part because of their typically transient or short lived nature with certain soapy solutions they can be made to last much longer antibubbles can be created by allowing a tap to drip into a container of water to which a drop or two of soap has been added being inherently unstable they are difficult to form the soap reduces the water s surface tension and allows the skin of air surrounding the droplet to remain in place for more than just a fraction of a second just as soap bubbles with air inside and air outside have negative buoyancy and tend to sink towards the ground so antibubbles with water inside and air outside have positive buoyancy and tend to rise towards the water surface but again just as soap

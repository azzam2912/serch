for example the implicit equation of the unit circle is formula 3 an implicit function is a function that is defined implicitly by an implicit equation by associating one of the variables the value with the others the arguments thus an implicit function for formula 4 in the context of the unit circle is defined implicitly by formula 5 this implicit equation defines formula 6 as a function of formula 7 only if formula 8 and one considers only non negative or non positive values for the values of the function the implicit function theorem provides conditions under which some kinds of relations define an implicit function namely relations defined as the indicator function of the zero set of some continuously differentiable multivariate function a common type of implicit function is an inverse function not all functions have a unique inverse function if g is a function of x that has a unique inverse then the inverse function of g called g is the unique function giving a solution of the equation for x in terms of y this solution can then be written as defining formula 11 as the inverse of formula 12 is an implicit definition for some

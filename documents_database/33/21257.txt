originally thought to occur only in the outer regions of the solar system where temperatures are low and water ice is common significant deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of the earth methane clathrates are common constituents of the shallow marine geosphere and they occur in deep sedimentary structures and form outcrops on the ocean floor methane hydrates are believed to form by the precipitation or crystallisation of methane migrating from deep along geological faults precipitation occurs when the methane comes in contact with water within the sea bed subject to temperature and pressure in 2008 research on antarctic vostok and epica dome c ice cores revealed that methane clathrates were also present in deep antarctic ice cores and record a history of atmospheric methane concentrations dating to 800 000 years ago the ice core methane clathrate record is a primary source of data for global warming research along with oxygen and carbon dioxide methane hydrates were discovered in russia in the 1960s and studies for extracting gas from it emerged at the beginning of the 21st century the nominal methane clathrate hydrate composition is ch ho or 1 mole of methane for

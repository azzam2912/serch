in particular it provided an argument for the uncertainty principle on the basis of the principles of classical optics recent theoretical and experimental developments have argued that heisenberg s intuitive explanation of his mathematical result is misleading while the act of measurement does lead to uncertainty the loss of precision is less than that predicted by heisenberg s argument when measured at the level of an individual state the formal mathematical result remains valid however and the original intuitive argument has also been vindicated mathematically when the notion of disturbance is expanded to be independent of any specific state heisenberg begins by supposing that an electron is like a classical particle moving in the formula 1 direction along a line below the microscope as in the illustration to the right let the cone of light rays leaving the microscope lens and focusing on the electron make an angle formula 2 with the electron let formula 3 be the wavelength of the light rays then according to the laws of classical optics the microscope can only resolve the position of the electron up to an accuracy of when an observer perceives an image of the particle it s because the light

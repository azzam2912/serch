such algorithms must be optimized to efficiently fetch and access data stored in slow bulk memory auxiliary memory such as hard drives or tape drives or when memory is on a computer network external memory algorithms are analyzed in the external memory model external memory algorithms are analyzed in an idealized model of computation called the external memory model or i o model or disk access model the external memory model is an abstract machine similar to the ram machine model but with a cache in addition to main memory the model captures the fact that read and write operations are much faster in a cache than in main memory and that reading long contiguous blocks is faster than reading randomly using a disk read and write head the running time of an algorithm in the external memory model is defined by the number of reads and writes to memory required the model was introduced by alok aggarwal and jeffrey vitter in 1988 the external memory model is related to the cache oblivious model but algorithms in the external memory model may know both the block size and the cache size for this reason the model is sometimes referred to

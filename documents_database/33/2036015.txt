an lcd surrounded by hand controls let a musician interact with sampler step sequencer mixer and effect features while stereo audio and midi signals are continuously output a compactflash card reader lets arbitrary digital sound recordings be loaded into ram for sample manipulation and step sequencing or the same functionality can be applied to live recordings made by the octatrack from the four input audio jacks up to eight tracks of these sequenced audio samples can be mixed to two pairs of stereo output jacks and can be monitored with a stereo headphone jack buttons spanning the lower part of the instrument usually represent musical time points with up to 64 points spread across four pages of the 16 buttons as each step is taken at the set tempo an led lights to show which button the sequence is at the musician programs the step sequencer to cause playback on one or more of the audio outputs by pressing these buttons to indicate where to start the sound eight more tracks for midi sequencing work in a similar way to send midi information across the midi out port thousands of these programmed sequences can be stored to the compactflash card

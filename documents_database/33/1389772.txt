it is a highly unusual hydrogen deficient carbon rich star v605 aquilae was first recorded as a nova in 1919 but it turned out to be a very unusual variable it was measured to be magnitude 10 4 at its peak investigation of prior photographs showed that it was magnitude 15 or fainter until 1918 when it brightened to 12th magnitude it stayed at 11th magnitude or brighter for over a year before fading from sight it then brightened to 12th magnitude in late 1921 and again in 1923 before disappearing the spectral type at the time of the outbursts was r0 a cool hydrogen deficient carbon star similar to some r coronae borealis rcb stars v605 aquilae was subsequently detected several times at magnitudes 18 20 but these are likely to have been detections only of a small knot of nebulosity surrounding the position of the star hubble images show that the star itself was fainter than magnitude 23 although the nebulosity was a bright irregular infrared object 2 5 across it was suspected that the star was still luminous but largely hidden by the dense nebulosity although the star could not be detected directly scattered light showed a

there are however three or four famous cases that are integrable the euler the lagrange and the kovalevskaya top in addition to the energy each of these tops involves three additional constants of motion that give rise to the integrability the euler top describes a free top without any particular symmetry moving in the absence of any external torque in which the fixed point is the center of gravity the lagrange top is a symmetric top in which two moments of inertia are the same and the center of gravity lies on the symmetry axis the kovalevskaya top is a special symmetric top with a unique ratio of the moments of inertia which satisfy the relation that is two moments of inertia are equal the third is half as large and the center of gravity is located in the plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis parallel to the plane of the two equal points the nonholonomic goryachev chaplygin top introduced by d goryachev in 1900 and integrated by sergey chaplygin in 1948 is also integrable formula 2 its center of gravity lies in the equatorial plane a classical top is defined by three principal axes defined by the three orthogonal

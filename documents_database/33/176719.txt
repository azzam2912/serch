this is particularly of use in order to crystallise them or to reconstitute them into lipid bilayers it has a critical micelle concentration of 9 mm it is an analog of the commonly used detergent octyl glucoside the presence of the thioether linkage making it resistant to degradation by beta glucosidase enzymes n alkyl thioglycosides of the n octyl thioglucopyranoside type are not naturally occurring however mustard oil glycosides are common natural s glycosides the synthesis of n octyl thioglucopyranoside starts from d glucose i which is prepared with acetic anhydride and concentrated sulfuric acid to give glucopyranose pentaacetate pentaacetylglucose ii pentaacetylglucose is reacted with hydrogen bromide to give 2 3 4 6 tetra o acetyl glucopyranosyl bromide acetobromo glucose iii which yields with thiourea in acetone almost quantitatively the isothiuronium salt 2 3 4 6 tetra o acetyl glucopyranosyl 1 isothiuronium bromide iv the nucleophilic thiolate anion formed after neutralization and reduction with sodium sulfite to the thiol in the alkaline reacts again almost quantitatively with 1 bromoctane to n octyl 2 3 4 6 tetra o acetyl 1 thio glucopyranoside peracetylated octylthioglucoside v from v the target product n octyl 1 thio glucopyranoside vi can be obtained in

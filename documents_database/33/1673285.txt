each have their own typical physical and chemical characteristics such as specific weight solids content maximum particle size as well as how they behave for example thixotropically abrasively or adhesively typical examples of high density solids are concrete sludges and slurries within industrial plants many substances with a high proportion of solids such as mechanically dewatered sewage sludges filter cakes bituminous coal sludges waste and process sludges have to be transported over relatively long distances to landfills or incineration plants in principle such long distances can be bridged with mechanical conveying equipment or high density solids pumps types of mechanical conveyors include belts screws worm and scrapers they are suitable for nearly all types of high density solids high density solids pumps move sludges and slurries within an enclosed pipeline however not every sludge or slurry is pumpable depending on depending on how the displacement principle is implemented a distinction can be drawn between rotary and reciprocating pumps the rotary circulation pumps includes eccentric screw pumps centrifugal pumps and squeezed tube peristaltic pumps reciprocating pumps include plunger diaphragm and piston pumps the high density solids pumps which can be used in the widest range of situations are piston or reciprocating

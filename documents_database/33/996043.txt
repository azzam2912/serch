she is believed to have been the wife of john young who bought a small parcel of land in windsor in 1641 sold it in 1649 and then disappeared from the town records she had a daughter alice young beamon who would be accused of witchcraft in nearby springfield massachusetts some 30 years later even though alice young was a woman without a son when the witchcraft accusation was lodged her husband was still alive during her accusation this makes it unlikely that she was accused simply for the possibility of inheriting her husband s estate in the future other reasons are more probable there is no further record of young s trial or the specifics of the charge only that alice young was a woman early historical records indicate that an influenza epidemic took hold of new england including the town of windsor connecticut colony in early 1647 the mortality rate that year increased dramatically and included many children it is possible that she was blamed for these deaths alice young was possibly hanged at the meeting house square in hartford connecticut on what is now the site of the old state house since a jail was also on

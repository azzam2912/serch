additionally its physiological function is thought to be similar to a protease inhibitor it has been concluded therefore that wap regulates the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells by preventing elastase type serine proteases from carrying out laminin degradation and by suppressing the map kinase signal pathway in the cell cycle whey acidic protein wap is the major milk protein in certain mammals there are exceptions in some mammalian species whereby wap has not been found to be synthesized in the mammary gland there have been several candidate markers for cancer most notably genes coding for elafin antileukoproteinase 1 previously called secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor slpi wap four disulphide core domain protein 1 previously called prostate stromal protein 20 kda ps20 and wap four disulphide core domain protein 2 previously called major human epididymis specific protein e4 he4 these genes can be useful biomarkers for detecting tumours whey acidic protein contains two to three four disulfide core domain also termed wap domain or wap motif each disulfide bond of the wap motif is made up of two cysteine molecule this motif is also found in other proteins of different functions which led to the suggestion that wap is associated with antiprotease

tendinous fibers extend to the greater tubercle with insertions into the bicipital groove the tendon of the muscle is separated from the neck of the scapula by a large bursa which communicates with the cavity of the shoulder joint through an aperture in the capsule the subscapularis is separated from the serratus anterior by the subscapularis supraserratus bursa the subscapularis is supplied by the upper and lower subscapular nerves branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus c5 c6 the subscapularis rotates the head of the humerus medially internal rotation and adducts it when the arm is raised it draws the humerus forward and downward it is a powerful defense to the front of the shoulder joint preventing displacement of the head of the humerus the gerber lift off test is the established clinical test for examination of the subscapularis the bear hug test internal rotation while palm is held on opposite shoulder and elbow is held in a position of maximal anterior translation for subscapularis muscle tears has high sensitivity positive bear hug and belly press tests indicate significant tearing of subscapularis there is no singularly imaging device or technique for a satisfying and complete subscapularis examination but

equivalent conditions are that k is generated over q by one root of an integer polynomial p all of the roots of p being real or that the tensor product algebra of k with the real field over q is isomorphic to a tensor power of r for example quadratic fields k of degree 2 over q are either real and then totally real or complex depending on whether the square root of a positive or negative number is adjoined to q in the case of cubic fields a cubic integer polynomial p irreducible over q will have at least one real root if it has one real and two complex roots the corresponding cubic extension of q defined by adjoining the real root will not be totally real although it is a field of real numbers the totally real number fields play a significant special role in algebraic number theory an abelian extension of q is either totally real or contains a totally real subfield over which it has degree two any number field that is galois over the rationals must be either totally real or totally imaginary

some forms of ntsc now use the yuv color space which is also used by other systems such as pal the y component represents the luma information and is the only component used by black and white television receivers i and q represent the chrominance information in yuv the u and v components can be thought of as x and y coordinates within the color space i and q can be thought of as a second pair of axes on the same graph rotated 33 therefore iq and uv represent different coordinate systems on the same plane the yiq system is intended to take advantage of human color response characteristics the eye is more sensitive to changes in the orange blue i range than in the purple green range q therefore less bandwidth is required for q than for i broadcast ntsc limits i to 1 3 mhz and q to 0 4 mhz i and q are frequency interleaved into the 4 mhz y signal which keeps the bandwidth of the overall signal down to 4 2 mhz in yuv systems since u and v both contain information in the orange blue range both components must be given the

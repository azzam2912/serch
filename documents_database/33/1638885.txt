the nuclear fission reactor core may be either a gas or plasma they may be capable of creating specific impulses of 3 000 5 000 s 30 to 50 kn s kg effective exhaust velocities 30 to 50 km s and thrust which is enough for relatively fast interplanetary travel heat transfer to the working fluid propellant is by thermal radiation mostly in the ultraviolet given off by the fission gas at a working temperature of around 25 000 c nuclear gas core reactor rockets can provide much higher specific impulse than solid core nuclear rockets because their temperature limitations are in the nozzle and core wall structural temperatures which are distanced from the hottest regions of the gas core consequently nuclear gas core reactors can provide much higher temperatures to the propellant solid core nuclear thermal rockets can develop higher specific impulse than conventional chemical rockets due to the low molecular weight of a hydrogen propellant but their operating temperatures are limited by the maximum temperature of the solid core because the reactor s temperatures cannot rise above its components lowest melting temperature due to the much higher temperatures achievable by the gaseous core design it can deliver higher

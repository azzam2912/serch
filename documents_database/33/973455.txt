located about northeast of kingcome this sketchily known complex resides at franklin glacier near mount waddington it is over in elevation and because of its considerable overall altitude a large proportion of the complex is covered by glacial ice magmatic activity of the franklin glacier complex spanded roughly four million years from the late miocene to the early pleistocene with the most recently identified volcanic eruption having taken place around 2 2 million years ago the existence of thermal springs near the complex implies that magmatic heat is still present it has therefore been of interest to geothermal exploration the area lies in one of british columbia s many territorial divisions called the range 2 coast land district local relief exceeds with the long valley filling franklin glacier originating from an icefield below the west face of mount waddington it is part of the waddington range a subrange of the pacific ranges which in turn are a subdivision of the coast mountains the franklin glacier complex was covered by the cordilleran ice sheet until its retreat about 13 000 years ago franklin glacier has since undergone glacial retreat and expansion throughout the holocene it appears to have retreated significantly during

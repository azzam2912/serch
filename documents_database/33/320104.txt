both free and open source software foss and open source hardware are created by this open source culture movement and apply a like concept to a variety of components it is sometimes thus referred to as fosh free and open source hardware the term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it coupling it closely to the maker movement hardware design i e mechanical drawings schematics bills of material pcb layout data hdl source code and integrated circuit layout data in addition to the software that drives the hardware are all released under free libre terms the original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the fosh community there is now significant evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for the scientific community since the rise of reconfigurable programmable logic devices sharing of logic designs has been a form of open source hardware instead of the schematics hardware description language hdl code is shared hdl descriptions are commonly used to set up system on a chip systems either in field programmable gate arrays fpga or directly in application specific integrated circuit asic designs hdl modules

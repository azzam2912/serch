the elaiosome is rich in lipids and proteins and may be variously shaped many plants have elaiosomes that attract ants which take the seed to their nest and feed the elaiosome to their larvae after the larvae have consumed the elaiosome the ants take the seed to their waste disposal area which is rich in nutrients from the ant frass and dead bodies where the seeds germinate this type of seed dispersal is termed myrmecochory from the greek ant myrmex and circular dance khore this type of symbiotic relationship appears to be mutualistic more specifically dispersive mutualism according to ricklefs r e 2001 as the plant benefits because its seeds are dispersed to favorable germination sites and also because it is planted carried underground by the ants elaiosomes develop in various ways either from seed tissues chalaza funiculus hilum raphe antiraphe or from fruit tissues exocarp receptacle flower tube perigonium style or spicule the various origins and developmental pathways apparently all serve the same main function i e attracting ants because elaiosomes are present in at least 11 000 but possibly up to 23 000 species of plants elaiosomes are a dramatic example of convergent evolution in flowering plants the

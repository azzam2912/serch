the esco starts by performing an analysis of the property designs an energy efficient solution installs the required elements and maintains the system to ensure energy savings during the payback period the savings in energy costs are often used to pay back the capital investment of the project over a five to twenty year period or reinvested into the building to allow for capital upgrades that may otherwise be unfeasible if the project does not provide returns on the investment the esco is often responsible to pay the difference the start of the energy services business can be attributed to the energy crisis of the late 1970s as entrepreneurs developed ways to combat the rise in energy costs one of the earliest examples was a company in texas time energy which introduced a device to automate the switching of lights and other equipment to regulate energy use the primary reason that the product did not initially sell was because potential users doubted that the savings would actually materialize to combat this doubt the company decided to install the device upfront and ask for a percentage of the savings that was accumulated the result was the basis for the esco model

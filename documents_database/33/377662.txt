it was the first to offer a pressurized cabin allowing it to cruise at an altitude of 20 000 ft 6 000 m well above many weather disturbances the pressure differential was 2 5 psi 17 kpa so at 14 700 ft 4 480 m the cabin air pressure was equivalent to an altitude of 8 000 ft 2 440 m the model 307 had capacity for a crew of six and 33 passengers the cabin was nearly 12 ft 3 6 m across it was the first land based aircraft to include a flight engineer as a crew member several flying boats had included a flight engineer position earlier in addition to its civilian service it was also flown as the boeing c 75 stratoliner by the united states army air forces who used it as a long range cargolift aircraft in 1935 boeing designed a four engine airliner based on its b 17 heavy bomber boeing model 299 then in development calling it the model 307 it combined the wings tail rudder landing gear and engines from their production b 17c with a new circular cross section fuselage of diameter designed to allow pressurization the first order for

the progress of deliming in pelts is monitored by the checking of ph values of process liquors and in the cutting of a pelt cross section phenolphthalein is used to monitor deliming pelt cross sectional progress the deliming process can be done with acids that can be rapid in their ph adjustment buffering salts like ammonium salts predominated the 20th century ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride can be used as deliming agents and they follow the following chemistry the ammonium ion is then free to penetrate the pelt cross section and further ionise to act as an acid the protons can then serve two functions namely to protonate basic groups of the collagen and neutralize solution alkali chemicals other weak acids can be used such as boric acid acetic formic lactic acid phosphoric acid and carbonic acid carbonic acid is used in a deliming process called carbon dioxide deliming strong acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid can also be used but their use is limited

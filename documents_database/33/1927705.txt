petersburg genome assembler is a genome assembly algorithm which was designed for single cell and multi cells bacterial data sets therefore it might not be suitable for large genomes projects spades works with ion torrent pacbio oxford nanopore and illumina paired end mate pairs and single reads spades has been integrated into galaxy pipelines by guy lionel and philip mabon studying the genome of single cells will help to track changes that occur in dna over time or associated with exposure to different conditions additionally many projects such as human microbiome project and antibiotics discovery would greatly benefit from single cell sequencing scs scs has an advantage over sequencing dna extracted from large number of cells the problem of averaging out the significant variations between cells can be overcome by using scs experimental and computational technologies are being optimized to allow researchers to sequence single cells for instance amplification of dna extracted from a single cell is one of the experimental challenges to maximize the accuracy and quality of scs a uniform dna amplification is needed it was demonstrated that using multiple annealing and looping based amplification cycles malbac for dna amplification generates less biasness compared to polymerase chain reaction

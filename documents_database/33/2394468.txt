such systems never reach local thermal equilibrium and retain local memory of their initial conditions for infinite times one can still define a notion of phase structure in these out of equilibrium systems strikingly mbl can even enable new kinds of exotic orders that are disallowed in thermal equilibrium a phenomenon that goes by the name of localization protected quantum order lpqo or eigenstate order the study of phases of matter and the transitions between them has been a central enterprise in physics for well over a century one of the earliest paradigms for elucidating phase structure associated most with landau classifies phases according to the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries present in a physical system more recently we have also made great strides in understanding topological phases of matter which lie outside landau s framework the order in topological phases cannot be characterized by local patterns of symmetry breaking and is instead encoded in global patterns of quantum entanglement all of this remarkable progress rests on the foundation of equilibrium statistical mechanics phases and phase transitions are only sharply defined for macroscopic systems in the thermodynamic limit and statistical mechanics allows us to make useful predictions about such macroscopic

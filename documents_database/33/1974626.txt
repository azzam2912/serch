the algorithms of this framework are efficient robust and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions wb the distributed whiteboard tool designed and implemented by mccanne and jacobson is the first application based on the scalable reliable multicast framework scalable reliable multicast is heavily based on the group delivery model that is the centerpiece of the ip multicast protocol it attempts to follow the core design principles of transmission control protocol internet protocol tcp ip it requires only the basic ip delivery model with possible duplication and reordering of packets and builds reliability on an end to end basis the algorithms in scalable reliable multicast dynamically adjust their control parameters based on the observed performance within a session like transmission control protocol adaptively setting timers or congestion control windows it has three major components multicast reliability and scalability it provides an efficient means to transmit data to multiple parties a single copy of the packet travels down any given network link and is duplicated at network branch points it is based on loss detection and re transmission policy since sender oriented reliability may lead to ack implosion it uses receiver based reliability it does not focus

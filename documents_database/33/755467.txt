a mixer settler consists of a first stage that mixes the phases together followed by a quiescent settling stage that allows the phases to separate by gravity a mixing chamber where a mechanical agitator brings in intimate contact the feed solution and the solvent to carry out the transfer of solute s the mechanical agitator is equipped with a motor which drives a mixing and pumping turbine this turbine draws the two phases from the settlers of the adjacent stages mixes them and transfers this emulsion to the associated settler the mixer may consists of one or multiple stages of mixing tanks common laboratory mixers consist of a single mixing stage whereas industrial scale copper mixers may consist of up to three mixer stages where each stage performs a combined pumping and mixing action use of multiple stages allows a longer reaction time and also minimizes the short circuiting of unreacted material through the mixers a settling chamber where the two phases separate by static decantation coalescence plates facilitate the separation of the emulsion into two phases heavy and light the two phases then pass to continuous stages by overflowing the light phase and heavy phase weirs the height of

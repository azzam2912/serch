micrornas function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by several mechanisms mir 210 has been strongly linked with the hypoxia pathway and is upregulated in response to hypoxia inducible factors it is also overexpressed in cells affected by cardiac disease and tumours mirna 210 in particular has been studied for its effects in rescuing cardiac function after myocardial infarcts via the up regulation of angiogenesis and inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis myocardial infarction is cardiac tissue necrosis that results from occlusion of blood supply via coronary arteries thereby starving cells of oxygen and nutrients termed ischemia prolong ischemia will eventually kill the cells and the destruction of cardiac cells leads to tissue death which can lead to heart failure delivery of mirna 210 to an ischemic heart improves heart function possibly by promoting the release of angiogenic factors like interleukin 1 il 1 tumor necrosis factor tnf and leptin as seen in hl 1 cardiomyocytes injected with mirna 210 however mirna 210 also targets the efna3 and ptp1b genes which are genes which endogenously regulate angiogenesis and apoptosis respectively ephrin a3 efna3 is a gene that is involved in the inhibition of angiogenesis although it is known that efna3

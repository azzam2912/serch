the term originates in a 1928 article by astrophysicist edward arthur milne where it was used to describe the effects that the astronomical metals in a star s outer regions had on that star s spectrum the name arose because the absorption lines act as a blanket causing the continuum temperature of the spectrum to rise over what it would have been if these lines were not present astronomical metals which produce most of a star s spectral absorption lines absorb a fraction of the star s radiant energy a phenomenon known as the blocking effect and then re emit it at a lower frequency as part of the backwarming effect the combination of both these effects results in the position of stars in a color color diagram to shift towards redder areas as the proportion of metals in them increases the blanketing effect is thus highly dependent on the metallicity index of a star which indicates the fraction of elements other than hydrogen and helium that compose it

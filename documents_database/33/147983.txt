tracing garbage collection is the most common type of garbage collection so much so that garbage collection often refers to tracing garbage collection rather than other methods such as reference counting and there are a large number of algorithms used in implementation informally an object is reachable if it is referenced by at least one variable in the program either directly or through references from other reachable objects more precisely objects can be reachable in only two ways the reachability definition of garbage is not optimal insofar as the last time a program uses an object could be long before that object falls out of the environment scope a distinction is sometimes drawn between syntactic garbage those objects the program cannot possibly reach and semantic garbage those objects the program will in fact never again use for example the problem of precisely identifying semantic garbage can easily be shown to be partially decidable a program that allocates an object x runs an arbitrary input program p and uses x if and only if p finishes would require a semantic garbage collector to solve the halting problem although conservative heuristic methods for semantic garbage detection remain an active research area essentially

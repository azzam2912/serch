it orbits with a brown dwarf companion with a period of 9 2 hours with an eclipse duration of approximately 20 minutes when it was discovered it was the first such pulsar known the prevailing theoretical explanation for the system implied that the companion is being destroyed by the gravitational environment roche lobe overflow caused by the neutron star and so the sobriquet black widow was applied to the object subsequent to this other objects with similar features have been discovered and the name has been applied to the class of millisecond pulsars with an ablating companion later observations of the object showed a bow shock in h alpha and a smaller in extent shock seen in x rays as observed by the chandra space telescope indicating a forward velocity of approximately a million kilometers per hour in 2010 it was estimated that the neutron star s mass was at least formula 1 and possibly as high as formula 2 the latter of which if true would surpass psr j1614 2230 for the title of most massive neutron star yet detected and place it within range of the tolman oppenheimer volkoff limit artist impressions of the black widow pulsar and

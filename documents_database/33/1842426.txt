through simple mechanical means it performs continual integration of the value of an input typical uses were the measurement of area or volume of material in industrial settings range keeping systems on ships and tachometric bombsights the addition of the torque amplifier by vannevar bush led to the differential analysers of the 1930s and 1940s the basic mechanism consists of two inputs and one output the first input is a spinning disk generally electrically driven and using some sort of governor to ensure that it turns at a fixed rate the second input is a movable carriage that holds a bearing against the input disk along its radius the bearing transfers motion from the disk to an output shaft the axis of the output shaft is oriented parallel to the rails of the carriage as the carriage slides the bearing remains in contact with both the disk the output allowing one to drive the other the spin rate of the output shaft is governed by the displacement of the carriage this is the integration when the bearing is positioned at the center of the disk no net motion is imparted the output shaft remains stationary as the carriage moves the

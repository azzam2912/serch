it is a member of a codice 1 which is an array without a given dimension it must be the last member of such a codice 1 and it must be accompanied by at least one other member as in the following example typically such structures serve as the header in a larger variable memory allocation the codice 3 operator on such a codice 1 gives the size of the structure as if the flexible array member was empty this may include padding added to accommodate the flexible member the compiler is also free to re use such padding as part of the array itself it is common to allocate codice 5 bytes this is not wrong however it may allocate a few more bytes than necessary the compiler may be re purposing some of the padding that is included in codice 6 should this be a concern macros are available to compute the minimum size while ensuring that the compiler s padding is not disrupted as the array may start in the padding before the end of the structure its content should always be accessed via indexing codice 7 or codice 8 not codice 3 in previous standards of

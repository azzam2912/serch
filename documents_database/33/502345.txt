it defines q calculus and h calculus where h ostensibly stands for planck s constant while q stands for quantum the two parameters are related by the formula where formula 2 is the reduced planck constant in the q calculus and h calculus differentials of functions are defined as and respectively derivatives of functions are then defined as fractions by the q derivative and by in the limit as h goes to 0 or equivalently as q goes to 1 these expressions take on the form of the derivative of classical calculus a function f x is a q antiderivative of f x if d f x f x the q antiderivative or q integral is denoted by formula 7 and an expression for f x can be found from the formula formula 8 which is called the jackson integral of f x for the series converges to a function f x on an interval 0 a if f x x is bounded on the interval 0 a for some the q integral is a riemann stieltjes integral with respect to a step function having infinitely many points of increase at the points q with the jump at the point

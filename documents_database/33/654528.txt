it was designed by yrj v is l professor v is l originally designed an astronomical camera similar to bernhard schmidt s schmidt camera but the design was unpublished v is l did mention it in a lecture notes in 1924 with a footnote problematic spherical focal plane once v is l saw schmidt s publication he promptly went ahead and solved the field flattening problem in schmidt s design by placing a doubly convex lens slightly in front of the film holder this resulting system is known as a schmidt v is l camera or sometimes as v is l camera this field flattening solution is not perfect as images suffer from chromatic aberration with different colors ending up at slightly different places however the approach is interesting thinking of modern electronic camera sensors which definitely cannot be forced into spherical surface shape nor even manufactured as such learning that he lost the inventor status motivated v is l to publish his less than perfect designs professor v is l not only designed the new optics but also built several implementations of the design after schmidt s publication his two first efforts were experiments to learn how to make

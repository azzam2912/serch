the orbicella species complex comprises three sister species namely orbicella faveolata orbicella annularis and orbicella franksi all of which are shallow water zooxanthellate species and are native to the tropical western atlantic ocean the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico these corals are ubiquitous in the caribbean their similar colony morphologies misled scientists to historically lump them into a single species montastraea annularis which included three morphotypes bumpy columnar and massive these growth forms were believed to arise as a response to abiotic factors e g depth light availability this taxonomic classification was challenged by further ecological reproductive genetic and morphologic evidence which led to the re description of three separate species montastraea faveolata massive m annularis columnar and m franksi bumpy a taxonomic revision published in 2012 established that the montastraea annularis species complex formed a separate clade now in the genus orbicella with three species names o faveolata o annularis o franksi o annularis and o faveolata are commonly called the boulder star coral and the mountainous star coral respectively the colonies of these corals are massive and form dome shaped mounds with uneven surfaces and bulging projections the corallites are small and closely packed these corals

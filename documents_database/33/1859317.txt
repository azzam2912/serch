it is represented by schl fli symbol of 3 8 having eight regular triangles around each vertex the half symmetry 1 8 3 4 3 3 can be shown with alternating two colors of triangles from 4 4 4 symmetry there are 15 small index subgroups 7 unique by mirror removal and alternation operators mirrors can be removed if its branch orders are all even and cuts neighboring branch orders in half removing two mirrors leaves a half order gyration point where the removed mirrors met in these images fundamental domains are alternately colored black and white and mirrors exist on the boundaries between colors adding 3 bisecting mirrors across each fundamental domains creates 832 symmetry the subgroup index 8 group 1 4 1 4 1 4 222222 is the commutator subgroup of 4 4 4 a larger subgroup is constructed 4 4 4 index 8 as 2 2222 with gyration points removed becomes 22222222 the symmetry can be doubled to 842 symmetry by adding a bisecting mirror across the fundamental domains the symmetry can be extended by 6 as 832 symmetry by 3 bisecting mirrors per domain from a wythoff construction there are ten hyperbolic uniform tilings that can

therefore the direction of the vibration of the electric field or polarization direction of the scattered light might be expected to be the same as that of the incident light in reality however some fraction of the raman scattered light has a polarization direction that is perpendicular to that of the incident light this component is called the perpendicular component naturally the component of the raman scattered light whose polarization direction is parallel to that of the incident light is called the parallel component and the raman scattered light consists of the parallel component and the perpendicular component the ratio of the peak intensity of the parallel and perpendicular component is known as the depolarization ratio defined in equation 1 for example a spectral band with a peak of intensity 10 units when the polarizers are parallel and intensity 1 unit when the polarizers are perpendicular would have a depolarization ratio of 1 10 0 1 which corresponds to a highly polarized band the value of the depolarization ratio of a raman band depends on the symmetry of the molecule and the normal vibrational mode in other words the point group of the molecule and its irreducible representation to which

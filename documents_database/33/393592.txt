as grown mgsi usually forms black crystals they are semiconductors with n type conductivity and have potential applications in thermoelectric generators mgsi crystallizes in the antifluorite structure in the face centered cubic lattice si centers occupy the corners and face centered positions of the unit cell and mg centers occupy eight tetrahedral sites in the interior of the unit cell the coordination numbers of si and mg are eight and four respectively it can be produced by heating silicon dioxide sio found in sand with excess magnesium the process first forms silicon metal and magnesium oxide and if an excess of sio is used then elemental silicon is formed if an excess of mg is present mgsi is formed from the reaction of the remaining magnesium with the silicon these reactions proceed exothermically magnesium silicide can be viewed as consisting of si ions as such it is reactive toward acids thus when magnesium silicide is treated with hydrochloric acid silane sih and magnesium chloride are produced sulfuric acid can be used as well these protonolysis reactions are typical of a group 2 and group 1 silicides magnesium silicide is used to create aluminium alloys of the 6000 series containing up

this species was discovered in 1939 by james r slater and john w slipp on the south shore of lake coeur d alene in northern idaho it was once considered to be a subspecies of van dyke s salamander as p vandykei idahoensis but appears to be a distinct and separate species as originally suggested by slater and slipp 1940 p idahoensis specimens are slender salamanders long the adult has a nasolabial groove parotoid glands and parasphenoid teeth coloration and markings key to characterizing this species include a dark ground color with a yellow gold dorsal stripe that extends the length of the organism as well as ventral yellow patches on the throat the toes of the coeur d alene salamander are shorter than those of the long toed salamander which aids in distinguishing the two species the eggs of the coeur d alene salamander have a unique appearance as well they are not pigmented and occur in grape like clusters attached by a single thread while the majority of this species is localized in northern idaho some instances of capture sighting in western montana and southeastern british columbia have occurred about 95 of observed populations in idaho and montana

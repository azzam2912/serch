one side of its head is like a sledgehammer and the other side is like an axe the maul is most commonly struck onto a flush cut section of log usually standing on end atop a splitting stump or other suitable base most cut sections can be split in a single downward chop of the maul splitting the wood apart along its grain mauls regularly become stuck in the log for several reasons such as the wood not being struck with adequate force the wood containing hidden knots or the length of wood being too long unlike an axe mauls are effective longer after the edge dulls as the primary mechanism is that of a wedge pushed through along the wood grain and not a cross grain chop of an axe in some cases longer logs may be split while they rest length wise on the base or ground mauls often become stuck in logs mid split requiring a full lift chop to be used this involves the chopper reswinging the maul but this time lifting the half split log while still attached to the embedded maul often requiring one or two additional full lift chops another technique for splitting

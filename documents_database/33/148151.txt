as it is a single point interface this interface becomes over complicated to implement the temporal coupling of these units is a major problem every interaction in the user interface must happen before the pushbutton is pressed business logic can only be applied after the button was pressed cohesion of each unit also tends to be poor features are bundled together whether they warrant this or not simply because there is no other structured place in which to put them to a user a magic pushbutton system appears clumsy and frustrating to use business logic is unavailable before the button press so the user interface appears as a bland form filling exercise there is no opportunity for assistance in filling out fields or for offering drop down lists of acceptable values in particular it is impossible to provide assistance with later fields based on entries already placed in earlier fields for instance a choice from a very large list of insurance claim codes might be filtered to a much smaller list if the user has already selected home car pet insurance or if they have already entered their own identification and so the system can determine the set of risks

the membranes can be ruptured using a specialized tool such as an amnihook or amnicot or they may be ruptured by the proceduralist s finger the different techniques for artificial rupture of membranes have not been extensively compared in the literature in one study comparing amnihook versus amnicot for artificial rupture of membranes use of an amnicot was associated with fewer neonatal scalp lacerations with the amnihook method a sterile plastic hook is inserted into the vagina and used to puncture the membranes containing the amniotic fluid with the membranes punctured amniotic fluid is able to escape from the uterus and exit the vagina the absence of a fluid buffer between the fetus and uterus stimulates uterine contractions which are also promoted by the rush of prostaglandins from the amniotic fluid there are four main reasons for performing an amniotomy 1 to induce labor or augment uterine activity despite evidence showing lack of effectiveness a 2013 cochrane review concluded that the evidence showed no shortening of the length of first stage of labour and a possible increase in caesarean section routine amniotomy is not recommended as part of standard labour management and care another cochrane review could not draw any

pellet boilers are used in central heating systems for heat requirements heating load from 3 9 kw kilowatt to 1 mw megawatt or more pellet central heating systems are used in single family homes and in larger residential commercial or institutional applications pellet boiler systems run most efficiently at full load and can usually be regulated down to 30 of full load since the warm up phase of pellet boilers usually takes longer than for oil or gas firing systems short burning phases have negative effects on the fuel efficiency in order to improve energy efficiency and reduce harmful emissions pellet boilers are usually combined with buffer systems such as insulated water tanks similar to wood chip heating systems pellet fuel is delivered periodically and automatically from the pellet storage for central heating systems or the day tank for a pellet stove according to need in the combustion chamber with the heat generated from the burning pellets circuit water is heated in the boiler of the pellet the heat distribution is the same as in other systems which use water for heat distribution unlike oil or gas heating systems pellet heating systems require the integration of a hot water tank

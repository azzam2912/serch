lone pairs are found in the outermost electron shell of atoms they can be identified by using a lewis structure electron pairs are therefore considered lone pairs if two electrons are paired but are not used in chemical bonding thus the number of lone pair electrons plus the number of bonding electrons equals the total number of valence electrons around an atom lone pair is a concept used in valence shell electron pair repulsion theory vsepr theory which explains the shapes of molecules they are also referred to in the chemistry of lewis acids and bases however not all non bonding pairs of electrons are considered by chemists to be lone pairs examples are the transition metals where the non bonding pairs do not influence molecular geometry and are said to be stereochemically inactive in molecular orbital theory fully delocalized canonical orbitals or localized in some form the concept of a lone pair is less distinct as the correspondence between an orbital and components of a lewis structure is often not straightforward nevertheless occupied non bonding orbitals or orbitals of mostly nonbonding character are frequently identified as lone pairs a single lone pair can be found with atoms in the

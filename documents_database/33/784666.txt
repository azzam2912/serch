it is known only from a fossil leaf and several fossil leaf fragments found in early to middle pleistocene sediment at regatta point in western tasmania these are long and very narrow with entire margins superficially resembling leaves of the extant b spinulosa hairpin banksia the fossils clearly belong to genus banksia section oncostylis series spicigerae the only difficulty being that all oncostylis taxa have a visible network of veins on the upper leaf surface whereas the fossil leaves appear not to they are most similar to the leaves of b spinulosa differing only in the absence of surface venation a longer petiole and the combination of narrow leaves with hairless undersides all forms of b spinulosa with leaves as narrow as those of b strahanensis have hairy undersides because of these differences the fossils are considered a separate species the species is believed to represent an extinct lineage it is unlikely to be an ancestor of any extant banksia species as the absence of leaf surface venation is thought to be an adaptation rather than a primitive state extinction was probably caused by the climatic and physical disruption of the early pleistocene glaciations the fossils of b strahanensis were

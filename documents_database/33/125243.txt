the two primes in the product may equal each other so the semiprimes include the squares of prime numbers because there are infinitely many prime numbers there are also infinitely many semiprimes semiprimes are also called biprimes the semiprimes less than 100 are semiprimes that are not square numbers are called discrete distinct or squarefree semiprimes the semiprimes are the case formula 1 of the formula 2 almost primes numbers with exactly formula 2 prime factors however some sources use semiprime to refer to a larger set of numbers the numbers with at most two prime factors including unit 1 primes and semiprimes these are semiprime numbers have no composite numbers as factors other than themselves for example the number 26 is semiprime and its only factors are 1 2 13 and 26 of which only 26 is composite for a squarefree semiprime formula 4 with formula 5 the value of euler s totient function formula 6 the number of positive integers less than or equal to formula 7 that are relatively prime to formula 7 takes the simple form this calculation is an important part of the application of semiprimes in the rsa cryptosystem for a square semiprime formula

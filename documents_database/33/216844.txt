it calculates the marginal distribution for each unobserved node or variable conditional on any observed nodes or variables belief propagation is commonly used in artificial intelligence and information theory and has demonstrated empirical success in numerous applications including low density parity check codes turbo codes free energy approximation and satisfiability the algorithm was first proposed by judea pearl in 1982 who formulated it as an exact inference algorithm on trees which was later extended to polytrees while it is not exact on general graphs it has been shown to be a useful approximate algorithm if x x is a set of discrete random variables with a joint mass function p the marginal distribution of a single x is simply the summation of p over all other variables however this quickly becomes computationally prohibitive if there are 100 binary variables then one needs to sum over 2 6 338 10 possible values by exploiting the polytree structure belief propagation allows the marginals to be computed much more efficiently variants of the belief propagation algorithm exist for several types of graphical models bayesian networks and markov random fields in particular we describe here the variant that operates on a factor graph a

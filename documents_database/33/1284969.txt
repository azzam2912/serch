the problem of finding a maximum cut in a graph is known as the max cut problem the problem can be stated simply as follows one wants a subset s of the vertex set such that the number of edges between s and the complementary subset is as large as possible there is a more general version of the problem called weighted max cut in this version each edge has a real number its weight and the objective is to maximize not the number of edges but the total weight of the edges between s and its complement the weighted max cut problem is often but not always restricted to non negative weights because negative weights can change the nature of the problem the following decision problem related to maximum cuts has been studied widely in theoretical computer science this problem is known to be np complete it is easy to see that the problem is in np a yes answer is easy to prove by presenting a large enough cut the np completeness of the problem can be shown for example by a reduction from maximum 2 satisfiability a restriction of the maximum satisfiability problem the weighted version of

it is linked to harmonic thinking the idea that vertical aggregates of notes can form a single unit a chord it is in this sense that one speaks of a c chord or a chord on c a chord built from c and of which the note or pitch c is the root when a chord is referred to in classical music or popular music without a reference to what type of chord it is either major or minor in most cases it is assumed a major triad which for c contains the notes c e and g the root need not be the bass note the lowest note of the chord the concept of root is linked to that of the inversion of chords which is derived from the notion of invertible counterpoint in this concept chords can be inverted while still retaining their root in tertian harmonic theory that is in a theory where chords can be considered stacks of third intervals e g in common practice tonality the root of a chord is the note on which the subsequent thirds are stacked for instance the root of a triad such as c major is c independently of

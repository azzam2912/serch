it is essentially a solution of as much as 80 the simple sugars sucrose glucose and fructose which are easily ingested and digested representing a rich and efficient source of nutrition this solution is often diluted either by the plant that produces it or by rain falling on a flower and many nectarivores possess adaptations to effectively rid themselves of any excess water ingested this way however nectar is an incomplete source of nutrition while it does contain proteins and amino acids these are found in low quantities and it is severely deficient in minerals and vitamins very few organisms consume nectar exclusively over their whole life cycle either supplementing it with other sources particularly insects thus overlapping with insectivores or only consuming it exclusively for a set period many species are nectar robbers or nectar thieves performing no pollination services to a plant while still consuming nectar nectar is produced by flowering plants to attract pollinators to visit the flowers and transport pollen between them flowers often have specialized structures that make the nectar accessible only for animals possessing appropriate morphological structures and there are numerous examples of coevolution between nectarivores and the flowers they pollinate for example hummingbirds

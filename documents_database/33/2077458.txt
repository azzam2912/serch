in fact the former is a special case of the latter as a banach space they are the continuous dual of the banach spaces formula 4 of absolutely summable sequences and formula 5 of absolutely integrable measurable functions if the measure space fulfills the conditions of being semifinite and localizable point wise multiplication gives them the structure of a banach algebra in fact they are the standard examples of abelian von neumann algebras the vector space formula 1 is a sequence space whose elements are the bounded sequences the vector space operations addition and scalar multiplication are applied coordinate by coordinate with respect to the norm formula 7 formula 8 is a standard example of a banach space in fact formula 1 can be considered as the formula 10 space with the largest formula 11 moreover every formula 12 defines a continuous functional on the space formula 13 of absolutely summable sequences by point wise multiplication and summing by evaluating on formula 15 we see that every continuous linear functional on formula 13 arises in this way i e not every continuous linear functional on formula 1 arises from an absolutely summable series however formula 13 and hence formula 20

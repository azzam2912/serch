the space obtained is called a quotient space and is denoted v n read v mod n or v by n formally the construction is as follows let v be a vector space over a field k and let n be a subspace of v we define an equivalence relation on v by stating that x y if x y n that is x is related to y if one can be obtained from the other by adding an element of n from this definition one can deduce that any element of n is related to the zero vector more precisely all the vectors in n get mapped into the equivalence class of the zero vector the equivalence class or in this case the coset of x is often denoted since it is given by the quotient space v n is then defined as v the set of all equivalence classes over v by scalar multiplication and addition are defined on the equivalence classes by it is not hard to check that these operations are well defined i e do not depend on the choice of representative these operations turn the quotient space v n into a vector space over

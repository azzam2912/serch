the virtual dedicated server vds has also a similar meaning a vps runs its own copy of an operating system os and customers may have superuser level access to that operating system instance so they can install almost any software that runs on that os for many purposes they are functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server and being software defined are able to be much more easily created and configured they are priced much lower than an equivalent physical server however as they share the underlying physical hardware with other vpses performance may be lower depending on the workload of any other executing virtual machines the force driving server virtualization is similar to that which led to the development of time sharing and multiprogramming in the past although the resources are still shared as under the time sharing model virtualization provides a higher level of security dependent on the type of virtualization used as the individual virtual servers are mostly isolated from each other and may run their own full fledged operating system which can be independently rebooted as a virtual instance partitioning a single server to appear as multiple servers has been increasingly common on microcomputers since the

this glass is formed naturally by the rapid cooling of molten basalt it is a type of mafic igneous rock that is decomposable by acids and readily fusible the color is a black or dark brown and it has a greasy looking resinous luster it is very brittle and occurs in dikes veins and intrusive masses the word originates from the ancient greek takhus meaning swift tachylites have the appearance of pitch and are often more or less vesicular and sometimes spherulitic they are very brittle and break down readily under a hammer small crystals of feldspar or olivine are sometimes visible in them with the unaided eye all tachylites weather rather easily and by oxidation of their iron become dark brown or red three modes of occurrence characterize this rock in all cases they are found under conditions which imply rapid cooling but they are much less common than acid volcanic glasses or obsidians the reason being apparently that the basic rocks have a stronger tendency to crystallize partly because they are more liquid and the molecules have more freedom to arrange themselves in crystalline order the fine scoria ashes or cinders thrown out by basaltic volcanoes are often

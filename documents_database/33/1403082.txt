they are found in many parts of north and south america most larvae are predators on soft bodied insects though a few species have been shown to feed on pollen adults feed on the pollen of a wide range of flowers the majority of species are 6 9 mm in length however the largest toxomerus insignis found throughout the northeastern part of north america is 13 mm long a common trait of species within the genus is their mimicry of stinging hymenoptera to avoid predators what distinguishes toxomerus from other hoverflies is the posterior indentation of their eyes and unique abdominal patterns the abdominal patterns are diagnostic at the species level within the genus eyes are large taking up approximately 2 3 of head and range from red to black in color males and females can be distinguished by the dorsal spacing of their eyes with males having a narrow gap and females having more space showing their ocelli both molecular and morphological analysis have been used to establish toxomerus monophyly not all of toxomerus species have been described though over 130 neotropical species and 6 endemic nearctic species are known some species have been discovered in the old world

these minimize the total of two costs in terms of time and energy arithmetic and communication communication in this context refers to moving data either between levels of memory or between multiple processors over a network it is much more expensive than arithmetic consider the following running time model total running time no of flops no of words from the fact that as measured in time and energy communication cost dominates computation cost technological trends indicate that the relative cost of communication is increasing on a variety of platforms from cloud computing to supercomputers to mobile devices the report also predicts that gap between dram access time and flops will increase 100x over coming decade to balance power usage between processors and dram energy consumption increases by orders of magnitude as we go higher in the memory hierarchy united states president barack obama cited communication avoiding algorithms in the fy 2012 department of energy budget request to congress new algorithm improves performance and accuracy on extreme scale computing systems on modern computer architectures communication between processors takes longer than the performance of a floating point arithmetic operation by a given processor ascr researchers have developed a new method derived from

in this article several approaches are discussed although the equations are in terms of electric and magnetic fields potentials and charges with currents generally speaking the most common description of the electromagnetic field uses two three dimensional vector fields called the electric field and the magnetic field these vector fields each have a value defined at every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the space and time coordinates as such they are often written as electric field and magnetic field if only the electric field e is non zero and is constant in time the field is said to be an electrostatic field similarly if only the magnetic field b is non zero and is constant in time the field is said to be a magnetostatic field however if either the electric or magnetic field has a time dependence then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field using maxwell s equations the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields whether in cases of electrostatics magnetostatics or electrodynamics electromagnetic fields is governed by maxwell s equations where is the charge density which can and often does depend on time and position

batteries which use nanotechnology are more capable than regular batteries because of the vastly improved surface area which allows for greater electrical performance such as fast charging and discharging in 2009 researchers from mit were able to charge a simple lithium iron phosphate nanoball battery in 10 seconds using this technology in theory this would allow for rapid charging of small electronic devices while larger batteries would still be limited by mains electricity before the carbon nanoballs can be made a carbon rod must be formed the carbon rod is prepared in the presence of acetylene with coke powder type of fuel source with few impurities and a high carbon content and formed using arc discharge technique arc discharge technique uses two high purity graphite electrodes as an anode and a cathode which are vaporized by the passage of a dc direct current current after arc discharging for a period of time a carbon rod is built up at the cathode the carbon rod is then put in a dc arc discharge reactor the carbon rod acts as the anode while a high purity graphite rod acts as the cathode a current adjusted to 70 90 amps was passed through

in digital electronics a stream of binary values is represented by a voltage or current waveform however digital signals are fundamentally analog in nature and all signals are subject to effects such as noise distortion and loss over short distances and at low bit rates a simple conductor can transmit this with sufficient fidelity at high bit rates and over longer distances or through various mediums various effects can degrade the electrical signal to the point where errors occur and the system or device fails signal integrity engineering is the task of analyzing and mitigating these effects it is an important activity at all levels of electronics packaging and assembly from internal connections of an integrated circuit ic through the package the printed circuit board pcb the backplane and inter system connections while there are some common themes at these various levels there are also practical considerations in particular the interconnect flight time versus the bit period that cause substantial differences in the approach to signal integrity for on chip connections versus chip to chip connections some of the main issues of concern for signal integrity are ringing crosstalk ground bounce distortion signal loss and power supply noise signal integrity

absent delocalization carbanions assume a trigonal pyramidal bent or linear geometry when the carbanionic carbon is bound to three e g methyl anion two e g phenyl anion or one e g acetylide anion substituents respectively formally a carbanion is the conjugate base of a carbon acid where b stands for the base carbanions have a concentration of electron density at the negatively charged carbon which in most cases reacts efficiently with a variety of electrophiles of varying strengths including carbonyl groups halogenating reagents e g n bromosuccinimide and diiodine and proton donors a carbanion is one of several reactive intermediates in organic chemistry in organic synthesis organolithium reagents and grignard reagents are commonly regarded as carbanions this is a convenient approximation although these species are almost always multinuclear clusters containing polar covalent bonds rather than true carbanions carbanions are typically nucleophilic and basic the basicity and nucleophilicity of carbanions are determined by the substituents on carbon these include geometry also affects the orbital hybridization of the charge bearing carbanion the greater the s character of the charge bearing atom the more stable the anion organometallic reagents like butyllithium hexameric cluster buli or methylmagnesium bromide ether complex memgbr oet are

the concept of elliptic curves over finite fields is widely used in elliptic curve cryptography applications of edwards curves to cryptography were developed by daniel j bernstein and tanja lange they pointed out several advantages of the edwards form in comparison to the more well known weierstrass form the equation of an edwards curve over a field k which does not have characteristic 2 is for some scalar formula 2 also the following form with parameters c and d is called an edwards curve where c d k with cd 1 c d 0 every edwards curve is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve in weierstrass form and thus admits an algebraic group law once one chooses a point to serve as a neutral element if k is finite then a sizeable fraction of all elliptic curves over k can be written as edwards curves often elliptic curves in edwards form are defined having c 1 without loss of generality in the following sections it is assumed that c 1 the points on an elliptic curve form an abelian group one can add points and take integer multiples of a single point when an elliptic curve is described by a

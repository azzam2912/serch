at the atomic level main group atoms having less than 8 electrons or transition metal atoms having less than 18 electrons are described as electron deficient at the molecular level molecules which have an incompletely filled set of bonding molecular orbitals are considered to be electron deficient thus ch and bh are electron deficient while methane ch and diborane bh are not not surprisingly electron deficient molecules are typically strongly electron attracting electrophilic as the most extreme form of electron deficiency one can consider the metallic bond for many years electron deficiency was often used as a general descriptor for boron hydrides and other molecules featuring multicenter bonding in which a pair of bonding electrons extends over more than two atoms as in three center two electron bonds as a way of distinguishing such molecules from conventionally bonded compounds such as hydrocarbons however this usage was incorrect as many indeed most of the molecules formerly labeled electron deficient such as boranes are actually electron precise an example is the extremely stable icosahedral bh dianion whose 26 cluster valence electrons exactly fill the 13 bonding molecular orbitals and is in no actual sense deficient in electrons indeed it is thermodynamically far

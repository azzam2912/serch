a large proportion of all proteins are part of this category for instance at least 1000 human proteins out of 20 000 contain zinc binding protein domains although there may be up to 3000 human zinc metalloproteins it is estimated that approximately half of all proteins contain a metal in another estimate about one quarter to one third of all proteins are proposed to require metals to carry out their functions thus metalloproteins have many different functions in cells such as storage and transport of proteins enzymes and signal transduction proteins or infectious diseases the abundance of metal binding proteins may be inherent to the amino acids that proteins use as even artificial proteins without evolutionary history will readily bind metals most metals in the human body are bound to proteins for instance the relatively high concentration of iron in the human body is mostly due to the iron in hemoglobin in metalloproteins metal ions are usually coordinated by nitrogen oxygen or sulfur centers belonging to amino acid residues of the protein these donor groups are often provided by side chains on the amino acid residues especially important are the imidazole substituent in histidine residues thiolate substituents in cysteine residues

load path analysis can be used to minimize the material needed in the load bearing member to support the design load load path analysis may be performed using the concept of a load transfer index u in a structure the main portion of the load is transferred through the stiffest route the u index represents the internal stiffness of every point within the structure consequently the line connecting the highest u values is the main load path in other words the main load path is the ridge line of the u distribution contour this method of analysis has been verified in physical experimentation in a structure the main portion of the load is transferred through the stiffest route the u index represents the internal stiffness of every point within the structure consequently the line connecting the highest u values is the main load path in other words the main load path is the ridge line of the u distribution contour the u index theory has been validated through two different physical experiments since the u index predicts the load paths based on the structural stiffness it is not affected by the stress concentration problems the load transfer analysis using the

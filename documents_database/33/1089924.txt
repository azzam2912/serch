carrot harvesters are either top lifters or share lifters and may be tractor mounted trailed behind a tractor or self propelled the machine typically harvests between one and six rows of carrots at once the two types of harvesters differ in how they get the carrots from the ground top lifters use rubber belts to grab the green tops of the carrot plant and pull them from the soil a share pushes under the carrot root and loosens the plant the belt takes the carrots with tops in to the machine where the tops are cut off and sent along a waste path and dropped back on to the field a share lifter uses a share to get the carrots out of the ground from underneath the machine must be preceded by a topper to cut the green tops off the carrot plants the carrots travel along a longer web to separate out the soil the carrot roots travel along one or more webs to remove most of the soil attached to the carrot the carrots are collected either in a storage tank on the machine or in a trailer pulled alongside the machine by another tractor

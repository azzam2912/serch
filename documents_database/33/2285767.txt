it straddles the border between the mount baker snoqualmie national forest and the wenatchee national forest and is also part of the glacier peak wilderness the glacier peak wilderness of the north cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the cascade range with craggy peaks ridges and deep glacial valleys geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the cascade range leading to the various climate differences the history of the formation of the cascade mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late eocene epoch with the north american plate overriding the pacific plate episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted in addition small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the north cascades about 50 million years ago during the pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris the u shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the north cascades area

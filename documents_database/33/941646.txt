brushed motors were the first commercially important application of electric power to driving mechanical energy and dc distribution systems were used for more than 100 years to operate motors in commercial and industrial buildings brushed dc motors can be varied in speed by changing the operating voltage or the strength of the magnetic field depending on the connections of the field to the power supply the speed and torque characteristics of a brushed motor can be altered to provide steady speed or speed inversely proportional to the mechanical load brushed motors continue to be used for electrical propulsion cranes paper machines and steel rolling mills since the brushes wear down and require replacement brushless dc motors using power electronic devices have displaced brushed motors from many applications the following graphics illustrate a simple two pole brushed dc motor when a current passes through the coil wound around a soft iron core the side of the positive pole is acted upon by an upwards force while the other side is acted upon by a downward force according to fleming s left hand rule the forces cause a turning effect on the coil making it rotate to make the motor rotate in

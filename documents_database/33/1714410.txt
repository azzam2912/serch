conventional airplanes accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff and reverse the process to land some airplanes can take off at low speed this being a short takeoff some aircraft such as helicopters and harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically rockets also usually take off vertically but some designs can land horizontally takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aircraft goes through a transition from moving along the ground taxiing to flying in the air usually starting on a runway for balloons helicopters and some specialized fixed wing aircraft vtol aircraft such as the harrier no runway is needed takeoff is the opposite of landing landing is the last part of a flight where a flying aircraft or spacecraft or animals returns to the ground when the flying object returns to water the process is called alighting although it is commonly called landing and touchdown as well a normal aircraft flight would include several parts of flight including taxi takeoff climb cruise descent and landing stol is an acronym for short take off and landing aircraft with very short runway requirements catobar catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery is a system

the depression which is located at the center of the prati del sirente a mountainous highland north of the sirente massif in the apennines is from the village of secinaro its formation has prompted a number of theories in recent years although in the absence of shock metamorphic and or geochemical evidence it is not yet possible to confirm the meteoritic impact theory no other theories for the origin of this geological structure have been proven yet interest in the sirente crater began in the late 1990s after swedish geologist jens orm an impact crater specialist noticed ridges near the site that indicated a bolide collision a research team named the sirente crater group along with two scientists from the international research school of planetary science of pescara irsps began a detailed examination of the area the team concluded the meteorite struck the earth with the force of a small nuclear bomb approximately one kiloton in yield the blast would have created a mushroom cloud and shockwaves similar to a nuclear explosion the sirente crater group proposed a meteoric origin for this structure in the late 1990s and results were updated in the following decade a calibrated age of 412

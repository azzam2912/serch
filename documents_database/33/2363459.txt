the aperture and the siphonal canal have about the same length as the spire the spire is acute made up of a rather small embryonic portion succeeded by numerous gradually increasing convex and more or less strongly costated whorls the apical angle is about twenty five to thirty degrees the protoconch is rather small consisting of about 1 smooth convex whorls the spire consistis of seven or eight regularly convex whorls with their greatest convexity about the middle of each whorl and with a well impressed suture the aperture is oval the outer lip is rather thin and smooth internally with a well defined broad but comparatively shallow sinus just below the suture from the sinus the lip projects slightly forward with a regular convex arch then curving downwards to join the anterior canal the sinusis about one to one and a half millimetre broad but usually only about half this measurement in depth at the anterior end the aperture opens into a long straight slender and open siphonal canal which is much longer than the aperture the inner lip shows a thin enamel coating the columella is simple and smooth straight slender and gently tapering to the anterior end

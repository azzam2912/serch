it is known only from three isolated populations in fiordland the distribution of s homerensis is not known to overlap with that of any other grasshopper species and it is known only from the earl mountains s homerensis is one of three known alpine grasshoppers found in fiordland the other species being alpinacris tumidicauda and sigaus takahe known sites of s homerensis are regularly swept clear of tall plants by avalanches making these areas more sparsely vegetated than the surrounding similar terrain and vegetation is found outside the known distribution however s homerensis are not found in these areas a possible explanation of this could be associated with avalanches vegetation height and sunshine hours this region receives high rainfall about 8000 mm year coupled with the lowest sunshine hours in new zealand 1400 to 1600 h year it appears that these small cleared areas are better for s homerensis than avalanche free areas with their taller vegetation new zealand acrididae are diurnal sun baskers and require basking surface to become active for the day s homerensis prefer altitudes between however it can be found as low as and as high as the wings on s homerensis are micropterous small wings

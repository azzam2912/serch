the gene is also called torpedo and ellipse the gene is located at 3 26 of the drosophila melanogaster genome it is named faint little ball because when the gene is mutated the embryo forms a ball of dorsal hypoderm flb is necessary for several processes to occur during embryonic development specifically in central nervous system development it is expressed as quickly as 4 hours after fertilization of the egg the peak of expression of the flb gene is between 4 8 hours into development in all processes that are facilitated by flb the same signal transduction pathway is used drosophila egf receptor is involved in the development of embryos as well as larvae pupae s wings eyes legs and ovaries whether looking at development in embryos or larvae pupae der relies on several ligands to carry out its function these are called spitz argos and gurken the efficiency of der corresponds with the sum of these three ligands as of yet the exact purpose of these ligands in the pathway of der is unknown but when expression of these ligands is altered from normal aberrant phenotypes of the embryos can be observed when der is over utilized in the

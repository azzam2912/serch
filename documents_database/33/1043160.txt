the minimum maximum of an inner node is equal to the minimum maximum of its children s minima maxima min max k d trees may be constructed recursively starting with the root node the splitting plane orientation and position is evaluated then the children s splitting planes and min max values are evaluated recursively the min max value of the current node is simply the minimum maximum of its children s minima maxima the min max k dtree has besides the properties of an k d tree the special property that an inner node s min max values coincide each with a min max value of either one child this allows to discard the storage of min max values at the leaf nodes by storing two bits at inner nodes assigning min max values to the children each inner node s min max values will be known in advance where the root node s min max values are stored separately each inner node has besides two min max values also two bits given defining to which child those min max values are assigned 0 to the left child 1 to the right child the non assigned min max values of

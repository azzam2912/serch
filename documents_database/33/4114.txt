the material to be internalized is surrounded by an area of cell membrane which then buds off inside the cell to form a vesicle containing the ingested material endocytosis includes pinocytosis cell drinking and phagocytosis cell eating it is a form of active transport the term was proposed by de duve in 1963 phagocytosis was discovered by lie metchnikoff in 1882 endocytosis pathways can be subdivided into four categories namely receptor mediated endocytosis also known as clathrin mediated endocytosis caveolae pinocytosis and phagocytosis more recent experiments have suggested that these morphological descriptions of endocytic events may be inadequate and a more appropriate method of classification may be based upon the clathrin dependence of particular pathways with multiple subtypes of clathrin dependent and clathrin independent endocytosis mechanistic insight into non phagocytic clathrin independent endocytosis has been lacking but a recent study has shown how graf1 regulates a highly prevalent clathrin independent endocytic pathway known as the clic geec pathway the endocytic pathway of mammalian cells consists of distinct membrane compartments which internalize molecules from the plasma membrane and recycle them back to the surface as in early endosomes and recycling endosomes or sort them to degradation as in late endosomes and

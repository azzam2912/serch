it is at the lower limit of visibility to the naked eye having a combined apparent visual magnitude of 6 08 the annual parallax shift of 16 90 mas provides a distance estimate of about 193 light years 57 persei is moving closer to the sun with a radial velocity of about 23 km s and will make perihelion in around 2 6 million years at a distance of roughly the primary member designated component a is a magnitude 6 18 yellow white hued f type main sequence star with a stellar classification of f0 v indicating it is generating energy by fusing its core hydrogen it is an estimated 1 6 billion years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 90 km s the star has 1 3 times the mass of the sun and is radiating 10 7 times the sun s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of around 6 615 k an unseen companion has been identified via slight changes to the proper motion of the primary the third member component b is a magnitude 6 87 f type star at an angular separation of 120 13 arc seconds this star

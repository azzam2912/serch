the process of repeatedly applying the same function is called iteration in this process starting from some initial number the result of applying a given function is fed again in the function as input and this process is repeated iterated functions are objects of study in computer science fractals dynamical systems mathematics and renormalization group physics the formal definition of an iterated function on a set x follows let be a set and be a function define as the n th iterate of where n is a non negative integer by and where is the identity function on and denotes function composition that is always associative because the notation may refer to both iteration composition of the function or exponentiation of the function the latter is commonly used in trigonometry some mathematicians choose to write for the n th iterate of the function in general the following identity holds for all non negative integers and this is structurally identical to the property of exponentiation that i e the special case in general for arbitrary general negative non integer etc indices and this relation is called the translation functional equation cf schr der s equation and abel equation on a logarithmic

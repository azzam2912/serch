several grades are known but most are gray solids some are pyrophoric most are used as air stable slurries raney nickel is used as a reagent and as a catalyst in organic chemistry it was developed in 1926 by american engineer murray raney for the hydrogenation of vegetable oils since raney is a registered trademark of w r grace and company only those products produced by its grace division are properly called raney nickel the more generic terms skeletal catalyst or sponge metal catalyst may be used to refer to catalysts with physical and chemical properties similar to those of raney nickel however since the grace company itself does not use any generic names for the catalysts it supplies raney may become generic under us trademark law the ni al alloy is prepared by dissolving nickel in molten aluminium followed by cooling quenching depending on the ni al ratio quenching produces a number of different phases during the quenching procedure small amounts of a third metal such as zinc or chromium are added to enhance the activity of the resulting catalyst this third metal is called a promoter the promoter changes the mixture from a binary alloy to a ternary

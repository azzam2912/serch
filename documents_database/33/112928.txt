many percussion instruments such as cymbals tam tams and chimes create complex and inharmonic sounds however in stringed instruments such as the piano violin and guitar or in some indian drums such as tabla the overtones are close to or in some cases quite exactly whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency any departure from this ideal harmonic series is known as inharmonicity the less elastic the strings are that is the shorter thicker smaller tension or stiffer they are the more inharmonicity they exhibit music harmony and intonation depends strongly on the harmonicity of tones an ideal homogeneous infinitesimally thin or infinitely flexible string or column of air has exactly harmonic modes of vibration in any real musical instrument the resonant body that produces the music tone typically a string wire or column of air deviates from this ideal and has some small or large amount of inharmonicity for instance a very thick string behaves less as an ideal string and more like a cylinder a tube of mass which has natural resonances that are not whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency when a string is bowed or tone in a wind instrument initiated by vibrating reed or

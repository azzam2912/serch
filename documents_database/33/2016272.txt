obasi the film which has a zero budget stars gabriel afolayan omowunmi dada and kelechi udegbe it premiered at the 4th africa international film festival where it won the award for best nigerian movie c j obasi had been visiting a friend in a slum location he observed unique features of the area which included for example the area has a single point of entry and exit the area also had only one source of water which everyone fetched from obasi then decided to develop a story based on this premise since it was feasible to create a story based on the consequences of pollution to the common nigerian in an interview obasi stated that he chose the name ojuju because he didn t want to use the word zombies in any manner or form as he believed that if such an outbreak occurred in the slums of lagos the zombie word would hardly be used to describe it obasi also felt it would be more realistic to eliminate any supernatural elements to the plot and localize the zombie genre for the nigerian environment rather than trying to do a hollywood version of what a zombie film ought to be

because of the low wing loading imposed by the ultralight rules it was not intended to be a competitive sailplane but to be used for recreational soaring it was first flown on 2 february 2002 the aircraft is made from composites and features an unusual tail configuration the fuselage joins the t tail halfway up the vertical stabilizer the folding three bladed propeller is mounted at the rear of the fuselage and so the lower half of the fin protects the propeller from contacting the ground the twin cylinder rdm 200 engine is mounted inside the fuselage just behind the pilot using trap doors for cooling and exhaust the engine drives the tail mounted propeller through an extension shaft the propeller folds automatically when the engine is shut down due to aerodynamic drag and also deploys automatically on engine start by centrifugal effect as it starts to spin a fuselage mounted fuel tank holds the graal has a semi tapered wing with a span that features top and bottom dive brakes full span flaperons and employs an eppler e668 airfoil landing gear is a retractable monowheel gear and the aircraft has a ballistic parachute the graal disassembles and is transported

the data are fitted by a method of successive approximations in nonlinear regression a statistical model of the form relates a vector of independent variables x and its associated observed dependent variables y the function f is nonlinear in the components of the vector of parameters but otherwise arbitrary for example the michaelis menten model for enzyme kinetics has two parameters and one independent variable related by f by this function is nonlinear because it cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the two formula 3 s systematic error may be present in the independent variables but its treatment is outside the scope of regression analysis if the independent variables are not error free this is an errors in variables model also outside this scope other examples of nonlinear functions include exponential functions logarithmic functions trigonometric functions power functions gaussian function and lorenz curves some functions such as the exponential or logarithmic functions can be transformed so that they are linear when so transformed standard linear regression can be performed but must be applied with caution see linearization transformation below for more details in general there is no closed form expression for the best fitting parameters as there is

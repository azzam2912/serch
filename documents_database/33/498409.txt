the observations could be taken with an existing space telescope possibly the james webb space telescope when it launches or a dedicated visible light optical telescope optimally designed for the task of finding exoplanets a preliminary research project was funded from 2005 through 2008 by nasa institute for advanced concepts niac and headed by webster cash of the university of colorado at boulder in conjunction with ball aerospace technologies corp northrop grumman southwest research institute and others since 2010 the project has been looking for additional financing from nasa and other sources in the amount of roughly us 3 billion including its own four meter telescope or 750 million for one starshade to be used with the james webb space telescope if financed and launched it would operate for five years currently the direct detection of extrasolar planets or exoplanets is extremely difficult this is primarily due to the difficulty of observing such a dim planet so close to a bright star is the obstacle that has prevented astronomers from directly photographing exoplanets to date only a handful of exoplanets have been photographed the first exoplanet to be photographed 2m1207b is in orbit around a star called 2m1207 astronomers were

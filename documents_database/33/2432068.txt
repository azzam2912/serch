main goal is to establish dose response relationships of a wide range of phenotypic traits for a large set of a biotic environmental factors a popular way to study the effect of the environment on plants is to set up experiments where subgroups of individuals of a species of interest are exposed to different levels of one environmental factor e g light co while all other factors are similar these studies have yielded a lot of insight into the way plants respond to the environment but may be challenging to integrate by means of a classical meta analysis one of the reasons for that is that phenotypic traits often respond to the environment in a non linear way rather than evaluating the difference between low co and high co grown plants it would be better to derive dose response curves which take into account at which co2 levels experiments were carried out metaphenomics uses a method to calculate dose response curves from a variety of experiments and is applicable to any phenotypic trait and many environmental variables core of the method used in metaphenomics is to scale all phenotypic data for a given species or genotype across all the levels

it is a one shot analogue of quantum relative entropy and shares many properties of the latter quantity in the study of quantum information theory we typically assume that information processing tasks are repeated multiple times independently the corresponding information theoretic notions are therefore defined in the asymptotic limit the quintessential entropy measure von neumann entropy is one such notion in contrast the study of one shot quantum information theory is concerned with information processing when a task is conducted only once new entropic measures emerge in this scenario as traditional notions cease to give a precise characterization of resource requirements formula 1 relative entropy is one such particularly interesting measure in the asymptotic scenario relative entropy acts as a parent quantity for other measures besides being an important measure itself similarly formula 1 relative entropy functions as a parent quantity for other measures in the one shot scenario to motivate the definition of the formula 1 relative entropy formula 5 consider the information processing task of hypothesis testing in hypothesis testing we wish to devise a strategy to distinguish between two density operators formula 6 and formula 7 a strategy is a povm with elements formula 8 and formula

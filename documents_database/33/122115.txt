these are groups g with the following properties the typical example of a 3 transposition group is a symmetric group where the fischer transpositions are genuinely transpositions the symmetric group s can be generated by transpositions 12 23 fischer was able to classify 3 transposition groups that satisfy certain extra technical conditions the groups he found fell mostly into several infinite classes besides symmetric groups certain classes of symplectic unitary and orthogonal groups but he also found 3 very large new groups these groups are usually referred to as fi fi and fi the first two of these are simple groups and the third contains the simple group fi of index 2 a starting point for the fischer groups is the unitary group psu 2 which could be thought of as a group fi in the series of fischer groups of order actually it is the double cover 2 psu 2 that becomes a subgroup of the new group this is the stabilizer of one vertex in a graph of 3510 2 3 5 13 these vertices are identified as conjugate 3 transpositions in the symmetry group fi of the graph the fischer groups are named by analogy with the

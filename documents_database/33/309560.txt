they inhabited both marine and freshwater habitats in the northern hemisphere and include genera such as hesperornis parahesperornis baptornis enaliornis and potamornis all strong swimming predatory divers many of the species most specialized for swimming were completely flightless the largest known hesperornithean canadaga arctica may have reached a maximum adult length of over hesperornitheans were the only mesozoic avialans to colonize the oceans they were wiped out in the cretaceous paleogene extinction event along with enantiornitheans and all other non avian dinosaurs as well as many other diverse plant and animal groups most of what is known about this group rests on analyses of single species as few provide sufficiently complete fossils for analysis although some of the smaller and more primitive species like those belonging to the subgroups enaliornithidae and brodavidae might have been able to fly the larger hesperornithids like hesperornis and baptornis had only vestigial wings as in the case of modern foot propelled diving birds the femur and metatarsus of these animals were short whereas the tibia was long the legs were also set far back on the body as in loons grebes or penguins hesperornithids must have been powerful swimmers and divers but extremely ungainly

polymorphism is a general concept in biology where more than one version of a trait is present in a population in some cases of differing counts the difference in chromosome counts is the result of a single chromosome undergoing fission where it splits into two smaller chromosomes or two undergoing fusion where two chromosomes join to form one this condition has been detected in many species trichomycterus davisi for example is an extreme case where the polymorphism was present within a single chimeric individual it has also been studied in alfalfa shrews brazilian rodents and an enormous variety of other animals and plants in one instance it has been found in a human another process resulting in differing chromosomal counts is polyploidy this results in cells which contain multiple copies of complete chromosome sets possessing chromosomes of varying shapes is generally the result of a chromosomal translocation or chromosomal inversion in a translocation genetic material is transferred from one chromosome to another either symmetrically or asymmetrically a robertsonian translocation in an inversion a segment of a chromosome is flipped end for end all forms of chromosomal polymorphism can be viewed as a step towards speciation polymorphisms will generally result in

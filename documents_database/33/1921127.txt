however no such notion exists in special relativity inside the 3 spaces of the inertial frames of minkowski spacetime in any rigidly rotating frame including the special case of a galilean inertial frame with coordinates formula 1 the newton center of mass of n particles of mass formula 2 and 3 positions formula 3 is the 3 vector both for free and interacting particles in a special relativistic inertial frame in minkowski spacetime with four vector coordinates formula 5 a collective variable with all the properties of the newton center of mass does not exist the primary properties of the non relativistic center of mass are it is interesting that the following three proposals for a relativistic center of mass appearing in the literature of the last century take on individually these three properties these three collective variables have all the same constant 3 velocity and all of them collapse into the newton center of mass in the non relativistic limit in the 1970s there was a big debate on this problem without any final conclusion in non relativistic mechanics the phase space expression of the ten generators of the galilei group of an isolated system of n particles with

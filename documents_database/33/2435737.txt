she works on microelectronics and is a member of the 6g flagship jantunen studied at the university of oulu after graduating she studied a range of graduate degrees and eventually spent ten years in industry in 2001 she returned to the university of oulu for her doctoral studies studying ceramic materials for use in telecommunications she used low temperature co firing ceramics to create radio frequency and microwave components she was appointed to the faculty at the university of oulu in 2004 jantunen was made head of the department of electrical engineering at the university of oulu in 2008 jantunen was supported by a european research council grant to investigate low temperature ceramics she is interested in materials that can be printed on paper to use in novel electronic devices she demonstrated that it is possible to make electroceramics that can operate at low temperatures making it possible to use 3d printing and low cost fabrication techniques before the work of jantunen the temperature required to produce electroceramics has been too high to process with semiconductor and polymers jantunen has reduced the ceramic production temperature below 500 c making it possible to integrate with heat sensitive materials and reducing energy

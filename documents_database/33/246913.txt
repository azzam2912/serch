however no violation of the cp symmetry has ever been seen in any experiment involving only the strong interaction as there is no known reason in qcd for it to necessarily be conserved this is a fine tuning problem known as the strong cp problem the strong cp problem is sometimes regarded as an unsolved problem in physics cp symmetry states that the laws of physics should be the same if a particle were interchanged with its antiparticle c symmetry as charges of antiparticles are the negative of the corresponding particle and then left and right were swapped p symmetry experiments do not indicate any cp violation in the qcd sector for example a generic cp violation in the strongly interacting sector would create an electric dipole moment of the neutron which would be comparable to 10 e m while the current experimental upper bound is roughly one billionth that size qcd does not violate the cp symmetry as easily as the electroweak theory unlike the electroweak theory in which the gauge fields couple to parity violating chiral currents the gluons of qcd couple to vector currents the absence of any observed violation of cp symmetry is a problem because

just as tubulins and actins the other major cytoskeletal proteins have prokaryotic homologs in respectively the ftsz and mreb proteins intermediate filaments are linked to the crescentin protein some of its homologs are also known as chromosome segregation protein para this protein family is found in caulobacter and methylobacterium crescentin was recently discovered by christine jacobs wagner in the prokaryote caulobacter crescentus now vibrioides an aquatic bacterium which uses its crescent shaped cells for enhanced motility the crescentin protein is located on the concave face of these cells and appears to be necessary for their shape as mutants lacking the protein form rod shaped cells to influence the shape of the caulobacter cells the helices of crescentin filaments associate with the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane on one lateral side of the cell this induces a curved cell shape in younger cells which are shorter than the helical pitch of crescentin but induces a spiral shape in older longer cells like eukaryotic intermediate filaments crescentin organizes into filaments and is present in a helical structure in the cell crescentin is necessary for both shapes of the caulobacter prokaryote vibroid crescent shape and helical shape which it may adopt after

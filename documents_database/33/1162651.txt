he was the founder of the physical theory of hamiltonian chaos and made pioneering contributions to the theory of quantum chaos in 1959 he invented the chirikov criterion which gives an analytical estimate for the overlap of resonances and provides the conditions for transition from integrability to global chaos in hamiltonian dynamical systems boris chirikov was born in the city oryol russia ussr graduated from the moscow institute of physics and technology in 1952 he worked with budker at the kurchatov institute and moved with him to siberia in september 1959 to work at the institute founded by budker in akademgorodok novosibirsk now budker institute of nuclear physics he became a corresponding member of the russian academy of sciences in 1983 and a full member in 1992 he worked at the institute in akademgorodok till his last days he left after him wife olga bashina and daughter galya chirikova the name of boris chirikov is associated with an impressive list of fundamental results in the field of dynamical chaos and foundations of statistical mechanics as early as 1959 in a seminal article chirikov proposed a criterion for the emergence of classical chaos in hamiltonian systems now known as the chirikov

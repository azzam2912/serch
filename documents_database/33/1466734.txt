the intention is to reduce heat losses into the wall by reflecting radiant heat away from the wall it is a form of radiant barrier and is intended to reduce energy losses and hence decrease fuel expenditure studies based both on modelling and experiments have demonstrated modest improvements in energy losses through the walls of houses through this method harris shows that plain aluminium foil was only marginally less effective than a propriety shaped foil that claimed to avoid temperature stratification he reports that reductions in the overall energy consumption of the test room of up to 6 were recorded by installing pain foil behind a radiator while the heat loss through the area of wall immediately behind the radiator fell to less than 30 of the original value in his 3m cubed test room with a 1 x 0 5 m radiator and walls of average u value 0 44 w mk he found that for a radiator temperature of 43 c the heat flux through the wall behind the radiator reduced from 7 1 to 3 1 w m note that the average heat loss in the room was not reduced by such a large percentage as only

although the designs were never finished and no models ever went into production the project spawned a number of organizational techniques and architectural innovations that have since become incorporated into nearly all high performance computers in existence today many of the ideas resulting from the project directly influenced the development of the ibm rs 6000 and more recently have contributed to the explicitly parallel instruction computing epic computing paradigm used by intel and hp in high performance processors the acs project began in 1961 as project y with a goal of building a machine that was one hundred times faster than stretch initial work began at the ibm watson research center a number of significant computer pioneers contributed to the project including john cocke herb schorr frances allen gene amdahl and lynn conway a decision by ibm in may 1968 to modify the project to support s 360 compatibility resulted in the name change from acs 1 to acs 360 for the computer being designed at its peak the acs 360 project involved over 200 engineers and staff the acs 360 project was canceled in may 1969 however many of the innovations resulting from the project would eventually find direct

the roman catholic church uses the term transubstantiation to describe the change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of christ eastern orthodox to have authoritatively used the same term to describe the change as in the longer catechism of the orthodox catholic eastern church and in the decrees of the 1672 synod of jerusalem the lutheran churches follow the teaching of martin luther in defining the presence of christ in the eucharistic elements as sacramental union often misconstrued as consubstantiation meaning that the fundamental substance of the body and blood of christ are literally present alongside the substance of the bread and wine which remain present lutherans too believe in and teach the real presence most protestant churches reject the idea of the real presence they observe eucharistic rites as simply memorials in the early church the faithful received the eucharist in the form of consecrated bread and wine saint maximus explains that in the old law the flesh of the sacrificial victim was shared with the people but the blood of the sacrifice was merely poured out on the altar under the new law however jesus blood was the drink shared by all of christ

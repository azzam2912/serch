this results in the tendency for a large void to be created behind the roof supports in the goaf or gob which collapses when the overlying cantilevered strata can no longer support its own weight when the collapse occurs the air or gas occupying the void is displaced by rock resulting in a pressure wave and windblast that propagates along the roadways tunnels of the mine this may be followed by a suck back as the air pressure is equalised with the low pressure created higher up in the goaf windblast can also occur in metalliferous kimberlite or even evaporite mines particularly in block caving mines as happened at the northparkes mine in nsw australia on 25 november 1999 killing 4 the effects of a windblast are not limited to the physical effects of the overpressure wave the effects of a windblast include broken bones and fatalities are not uncommon outcomes from serious windblast events windblast prevention is centred on not allowing the void to form in the first place this can be somewhat achieved through careful mine planning windblast prevention also relies on monitoring to ensure the void does not form and stopping production if one does begin to

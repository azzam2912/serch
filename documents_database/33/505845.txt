given functions f and g in k c i e rational functions on c then where the notation has this meaning h is the divisor of the function h or in other words the formal sum of its zeroes and poles counted with multiplicity and a function applied to a formal sum means the product with multiplicities poles counting as a negative multiplicity of the values of the function at the points of the divisor with this definition there must be the side condition that the divisors of f and g have disjoint support which can be removed in the case of the projective line this can be proved by manipulations with the resultant of polynomials to remove the condition of disjoint support for each point p on c a local symbol is defined in such a way that the statement given is equivalent to saying that the product over all p of the local symbols is 1 when f and g both take the values 0 or at p the definition is essentially in limiting or removable singularity terms by considering up to sign with a and b such that the function has neither a zero nor a pole

briefly the standard part function rounds off a finite hyperreal to the nearest real it associates to every such hyperreal formula 1 the unique real formula 2 infinitely close to it i e formula 3 is infinitesimal as such it is a mathematical implementation of the historical concept of adequality introduced by pierre de fermat as well as leibniz s transcendental law of homogeneity the standard part function was first defined by abraham robinson who used the notation formula 4 for the standard part of a hyperreal formula 1 see robinson 1974 this concept plays a key role in defining the concepts of the calculus such as continuity the derivative and the integral in non standard analysis the latter theory is a rigorous formalisation of calculations with infinitesimals the standard part of x is sometimes referred to as its shadow nonstandard analysis deals primarily with the pair formula 6 where the hyperreals formula 7 are an ordered field extension of the reals formula 8 and contain infinitesimals in addition to the reals in the hyperreal line every real number has a collection of numbers called a monad or halo of hyperreals infinitely close to it the standard part function associates

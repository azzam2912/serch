the data source is usually called a file or stream in the c standard library the character reading functions such as getchar return a value equal to the symbolic value macro codice 1 to indicate that an end of file condition has occurred the actual value of codice 1 is implementation dependent but is commonly 1 such as in glibc and is distinct from all valid character codes block reading functions return the number of bytes read and if this is fewer than asked for then the end of file was reached or an error occurred checking of codice 3 or dedicated function such as codice 4 is often required to determine which input from a terminal never really ends unless the device is disconnected but it is useful to enter more than one file into a terminal so a key sequence is reserved to indicate end of input in unix the translation of the keystroke to eof is performed by the terminal driver so a program does not need to distinguish terminals from other input files by default the driver converts a control d character at the start of a line into an end of file indicator to insert

it operates on the principle of solid state diffusion wherein the atoms of two solid metallic surfaces intersperse themselves over time this is typically accomplished at an elevated temperature approximately 50 70 of the absolute melting temperature of the materials diffusion bonding is usually implemented by applying high pressure in conjunction with necessarily high temperature to the materials to be welded the technique is most commonly used to weld sandwiches of alternating layers of thin metal foil and metal wires or filaments currently the diffusion bonding method is widely used in the joining of high strength and refractory metals within the aerospace and nuclear industries the act of diffusion welding is centuries old this can be found in the form of filled gold a technique used to bond gold and copper for use in jewelry and other applications in order to create filled gold smiths would begin by hammering out an amount of solid gold into a thin sheet of gold foil this film was then placed on top of a copper substrate and weighted down finally using a process known as hot pressure welding or hpw the weight copper gold film assembly was placed inside an oven and heated

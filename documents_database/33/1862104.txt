land was donated by william jordon and the first of several businesses were established thereon in 1920 one of the first concrete highways in southern illinois was started and the survey of the road currently named u s route 45 running between louisville illinois and effingham illinois was initiated keeping with the axiom that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line in this case between louisville and effingham the road survey took the planned route 29 miles to the west of where jordon was located unfortunately for jordon this was just enough distance to make their little village too much out of the way to attract traffic on the new highway which the local merchants hope to capitalize on to increase their business sales small towns in illinois at the turn of the 20th century were places for farmers to buy and sell grain do some banking buy goods at the general store get blacksmith work done and of course attend church the merchants in jordon reasoned that if the new route 45 would not come to them then they would go to route 45 records are conflicting on whether it was john hord or george hord

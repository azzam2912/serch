it is a silicide of uranium there has been recent interest in using uranium disilicide as an alternative to uranium dioxide for fuel in nuclear reactors advantages are higher percentage of uranium and higher thermal conductivity a direct replacement of uo with usi should enable a reactor to generate more energy from a set of fuel rods and also provide more coping time in the case of a loca loss of cooling accident the development of uranium disilicide uranium nitride or other high thermal conductivity uranium compound may be critical for the performance of accident tolerant fuel a development effort mandated by the us department of energy this is due to zircalloy having a higher thermal conductivity than all replacement materials being developed in particular sic sic cmc link which has several superior material properties to zircalloy for this application has about five times lower thermal conductivity varies due to the manufacturing methods used for the fiber and for the matrix than zircalloy refs on sic sic and zircalloy the lower thermal conductivity means that a reactor using fuel rods with sic sic cmc cladding and conventional uo fuel will have to either 1 run at a lower power output

this colorless water miscible high boiling liquid is commonly used as a polar solvent in organic synthesis dma is miscible with most other solvents although it is poorly soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons the separation and purification of the product is carried out by multistage distillation in rectification columns dma is obtained with 99 yield referred to methyl acetate dma is prepared commercially by the reaction of dimethylamine with acetic anhydride or acetic acid dehydration of the salt of dimethylamine and acetic acid also furnishes this compound dimethylacetamide can also be produced by the reaction of dimethylamine with methyl acetate the chemical reactions of dimethylacetamide are typical of n n disubstituted amides hydrolysis of the acyl n bond occurs in the presence of acids it is however resistant to bases for this reason dma is useful solvent for reactions involving strong bases such as sodium hydroxide dimethylacetamide is commonly used as a solvent for fibers e g polyacrylonitrile spandex or in the adhesive industry it is also employed in the production of pharmaceuticals and plasticizers as a reaction medium dimethylacetamide is also used as an excipient in drugs e g in vumon teniposide busulfex busulfan or amsidine amsacrine dma is an

the standard method establishes a first order ordinary differential equation and solves it by separation of variables both steps may be difficult or even impossible in such cases one has to apply numerical methods orthogonal trajectories are used in mathematics for example as curved coordinate systems i e elliptic coordinates or appear in physics as electric fields and their equipotential curves if the trajectory intersects the given curves by an arbitrary but fixed angle one gets an isogonal trajectory generally one assumes that the pencil of curves is implicitly given by an equation where formula 4 is the parameter of the pencil if the pencil is given explicitly by an equation formula 5 one can change the representation into an implicit one formula 6 for the consideration below it is supposed that all necessary derivatives do exist differentiating implicitly for formula 7 yields now it is assumed that equation 0 can be solved for parameter formula 4 which can thus be eliminated from equation 1 one gets the differential equation of first order which is fulfilled by the given pencil of curves because the slope of the orthogonal trajectory at a point formula 15 is the negative multiplicative inverse of

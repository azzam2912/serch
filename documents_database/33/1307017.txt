just like in an electrostatic interaction where a region of negative charge interacts with a positive charge the electron rich system can interact with a metal cationic or neutral an anion another molecule and even another system non covalent interactions involving systems are pivotal to biological events such as protein ligand recognition the most common types of interactions involve metal interactions play a major role in organometallics linear and cyclic systems bond to metals allowing organic complexes to bond to metals ethylene in the most simple linear systems bonding to metals takes place by two interactions electron density is donated directly to the metal like a sigma bond would be formed also the metal can donate electron density back to the linear system ethylene from the metal s d orbital to the empty orbital of ethylene allyl allyl groups can bond to metals as trihapto or monohapto ligands monohapto ligands bind mostly sigma orbitals and trihapto ligands bind using delocalized orbitals in essence the monohapto ligand binds the metal as an allyl group and the trihapto ligand binds over all three carbons where the lowest energy orbital donates electron density and the highest energy orbital accepts electron density the allyl

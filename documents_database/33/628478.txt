it is implicated in alzheimer s disease and cardiovascular disease apoe belongs to a family of fat binding proteins called apolipoproteins apoe interacts significantly with low density lipoprotein receptor ldlr which is essential for the normal processing catabolism of triglyceride rich lipoproteins in peripheral tissues apoe is primarily produced by the liver and macrophages and mediates cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous system apoe is mainly produced by astrocytes and transports cholesterol to neurons via apoe receptors which are members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family apoe is the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain apoe qualifies as a checkpoint inhibitor of the classical complement pathway by complex formation with activated c1q the gene apoe is mapped to chromosome 19 in a cluster with apolipoprotein c1 apoc1 and the apolipoprotein c2 apoc2 the apoe gene consists of four exons and three introns totaling 3597 base pairs apoe is transcriptionally activated by the liver x receptor an important regulator of cholesterol fatty acid and glucose homeostasis and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor nuclear receptors that form heterodimers with retinoid x receptors in melanocytic cells apoe gene expression may be regulated by mitf apoe is 299 amino acids long and contains

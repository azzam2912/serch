organotitanium chemistry is the science of organotitanium compounds describing their physical properties synthesis and reactions they are reagents in organic chemistry and are involved in major industrial processes although the first attempt to create an organotitanium compound dates back to 1861 it took until 1953 for the first synthesis of such a compound in that year titanium phenyltriisopropoxide was prepared from titanium isopropoxide phenyllithium and titanium tetrachloride titanocene dichloride was discovered in 1954 and the first methyltitanium compounds were produced in 1959 ziegler natta catalysts utilizing titanium based catalysts soon followed as a major commercial application for which the 1963 nobel prize in chemistry was awarded the titanium electron configuration ar 3d4s resembles that of carbon and like carbon the 4 oxidation state dominates and like carbon compounds those of titanium have a tetrahedral molecular geometry thus the boiling points of ticl and ccl are very similar titanium is however a much larger element than carbon reflected by the ti c bond lengths being about 30 longer e g 210 pm in tetrabenzyltitanium vs a typical c c bond of 155 pm simple tetraalkyltitanium compounds however are not typically stable owing to the large size of titanium and the electron

the radii and center of these circles are called inradius and circumradius and incenter and circumcenter respectively from the definition it follows that bicentric quadrilaterals have all the properties of both tangential quadrilaterals and cyclic quadrilaterals other names for these quadrilaterals are chord tangent quadrilateral and inscribed and circumscribed quadrilateral it has also rarely been called a double circle quadrilateral and double scribed quadrilateral if two circles one within the other are the incircle and the circumcircle of a bicentric quadrilateral then every point on the circumcircle is the vertex of a bicentric quadrilateral having the same incircle and circumcircle this is a corollary of poncelet s porism which was proved by the french mathematician jean victor poncelet 1788 1867 examples of bicentric quadrilaterals are squares right kites and isosceles tangential trapezoids a convex quadrilateral abcd with sides a b c d is bicentric if and only if opposite sides satisfy pitot s theorem for tangential quadrilaterals and the cyclic quadrilateral property that opposite angles are supplementary that is three other characterizations concern the points where the incircle in a tangential quadrilateral is tangent to the sides if the incircle is tangent to the sides ab bc cd da at

in a classical scattering system there will be one or more impact parameters b in which a particle is sent into the scatterer this gives rise to one or more exit parameters y as the particle exits towards infinity while the particle is traversing the system there may also be a delay time t the time it takes for the particle to exit the system in addition to the distance travelled s which in certain systems i e billiard like systems in which the particle undergoes lossless collisions with hard fixed objects the two will be equivalent see below in a chaotic scattering system a minute change in the impact parameter may give rise to a very large change in the exit parameters an excellent example system is the gaspard rice gr scattering system also known simply as the three disc system which embodies many of the important concepts in chaotic scattering while being simple and easy to understand and simulate the concept is very simple we have three hard discs arranged in some triangular formation a point particle is sent in and undergoes perfect elastic collisions until it exits towards infinity in this discussion we will only consider gr

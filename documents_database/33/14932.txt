in its original strong form fermat s principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traversed in the least time in order to be true in all cases this statement must be weakened by replacing the least time with a time that is stationary with respect to variations of the path so that a deviation in the path causes at most a second order change in the traversal time to put it loosely a ray path is surrounded by close paths that can be traversed in very close times it can be shown that this technical definition corresponds to more intuitive notions of a ray such as a line of sight or the path of a narrow beam first proposed by the french mathematician pierre de fermat in 1662 as a means of explaining the ordinary law of refraction of light fig 1 fermat s principle was initially controversial because it seemed to ascribe knowledge and intent to nature not until the 19th century was it understood that nature s ability to test alternative paths is merely a fundamental property of waves if points a and b are given

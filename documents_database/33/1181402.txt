its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 04 and an inclination of 14 with respect to the ecliptic the asteroid was first identified as at heidelberg observatory in 1926 extending the body s observation arc by 62 years prior to its official discovery observation at kitami fukushima has been characterized as a reddish p type asteroid by the neowise mission of nasa s wide field infrared survey explorer it is also an assumed c type asteroid several high quality rotational lightcurves were obtained from photometric observations since 2003 an observation by brian warner at the u s palmer divide observatory in colorado rendered a rotation period of hours with a high brightness variation of 0 67 in magnitude indicating that the body has a non spherical shape this observation concurs with another measurement taken at the oakley observatory that rendered a period of and an amplitude of 0 50 mag superseding a less accurate lightcurve produced by the pds of 8 40 hours in 2011 an observation by ren roy gave another concurring period of hours and an amplitude of 0 79 mag on 16 december 2012 the asteroid occulted the star hip 4315 over parts of europe and north

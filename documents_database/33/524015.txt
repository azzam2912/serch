in diophantine geometry height functions quantify the size of solutions to diophantine equations and are typically functions from a set of points on algebraic varieties or a set of algebraic varieties to the real numbers for instance the classical or naive height over the rational numbers is typically defined to be the maximum of the numerators and denominators of the coordinates e g 3 for the coordinates but in a logarithmic scale height functions allow mathematicians to count objects such as rational points that are otherwise infinite in quantity for instance the set of rational numbers of naive height the maximum of the numerator and denominator when expressed in lowest terms below any given constant is finite despite the set of rational numbers being infinite in this sense height functions can be used to prove asymptotic results such as baker s theorem in transcendental number theory which was proved by in other cases height functions can distinguish some objects based on their complexity for instance the subspace theorem proved by demonstrates that points of small height i e small complexity in projective space lie in a finite number of hyperplanes and generalizes siegel s theorem on integral points and solution

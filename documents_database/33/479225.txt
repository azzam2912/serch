these smaller dfts are then combined via size r butterflies which themselves are dfts of size r performed m times on corresponding outputs of the sub transforms pre multiplied by roots of unity known as twiddle factors this is the decimation in time case one can also perform the steps in reverse known as decimation in frequency where the butterflies come first and are post multiplied by twiddle factors see also the cooley tukey fft article in the case of the radix 2 cooley tukey algorithm the butterfly is simply a dft of size 2 that takes two inputs x x corresponding outputs of the two sub transforms and gives two outputs y y by the formula not including twiddle factors if one draws the data flow diagram for this pair of operations the x x to y y lines cross and resemble the wings of a butterfly hence the name see also the illustration at right more specifically a radix 2 decimation in time fft algorithm on n 2 inputs with respect to a primitive n th root of unity formula 3 relies on o n log n butterflies of the form where k is an integer depending on

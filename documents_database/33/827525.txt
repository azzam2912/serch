it is named after heinrich jung who first studied this inequality in 1901 consider a compact set and let be the diameter of k that is the largest euclidean distance between any two of its points jung s theorem states that there exists a closed ball with radius that contains k the boundary case of equality is attained by the regular n simplex most common is the case of jung s theorem in the plane that is n 2 in this case the theorem states that there exists a circle enclosing all points whose radius satisfies no tighter bound on r can be shown when k is an equilateral triangle or its three vertices then for any bounded set s in any metric space d 2 r d the first inequality is implied by the triangle inequality for the center of the ball and the two diametral points and the second inequality follows since a ball of radius d centered at any point of s will contain all of s in a uniform metric space that is a space in which all distances are equal r d at the other end of the spectrum in an injective metric space such

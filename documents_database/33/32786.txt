there are parallels with the shoaling behavior of fish the swarming behavior of insects and herd behavior of land animals computer simulations and mathematical models which have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviors of birds can also generally be applied to the flocking behavior of other species as a result the term flocking is sometimes applied in computer science to species other than birds this article is about the modelling of flocking behavior from the perspective of the mathematical modeller flocking is the collective motion by a group of self propelled entities and is a collective animal behavior exhibited by many living beings such as birds fish bacteria and insects it is considered an emergent behavior arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination flocking behavior was simulated on a computer in 1987 by craig reynolds with his simulation program boids this program simulates simple agents boids that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules the result is akin to a flock of birds a school of fish or a swarm of insects basic models of flocking behavior are controlled by three simple rules with these three

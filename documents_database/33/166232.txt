the symbol for microgravity g was used on the insignias of space shuttle flights sts 87 and sts 107 because these flights were devoted to microgravity research in low earth orbit a stationary micro g environment would require travelling far enough into deep space so as to reduce the effect of gravity by attenuation to almost zero this is the simplest in conception but requires travelling an enormous distance rendering it highly impractical for example to reduce the gravity of the earth by a factor of one million one needs to be at a distance of 6 million kilometres from the earth but to reduce the gravity of the sun to this amount one has to be at a distance of 3 7 billion kilometres on earth the gravity due to the rest of the milky way is already attenuated by a factor greater than one million so we do not need to move away further from its center thus it is not impossible but it has only been achieved so far by four interstellar probes voyager 1 and 2 of the voyager program and pioneer 10 and 11 of the pioneer program and they did not return to earth

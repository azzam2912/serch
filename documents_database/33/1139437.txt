enac is assembled as a heterotrimer composed of three homologous subunits and or and the other enac subunits are encoded by scnn1a scnn1b and scnn1g enac is expressed in epithelial cells and is different from the voltage gated sodium channel that is involved in the generation of action potentials in neurons the abbreviation for the genes encoding for voltage gated sodium channel starts with three letters scn in contrast to these sodium channels enac is constitutively active and is not voltage dependent the second n in the abbreviation scnn1d represents that these are non voltage gated channels in most vertebrates sodium ions are the major determinant of the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid enac allows transfer of sodium ions across the epithelial cell membrane in so called tight epithelia that have low permeability the flow of sodium ions across epithelia affects osmolarity of the extracellular fluid thus enac plays a central role in the regulation of body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and consequently affects blood pressure as enac is strongly inhibited by amiloride it is also referred to as an amiloride sensitive sodium channel the first cdna encoding the delta subunit of enac was cloned and sequenced by waldmann et

its 21 chapters cover a variety of topics related to cardiac arrhythmia and electrophysiology primarily reviewing known molecular targets for drugs subjects covered in the book include both traditional approaches to looking at arrhythmia such as ion channel effects and more general issues such as the genetics behind differential response to existing drug therapies drug safety and side effects are also cover the book examines avenues by which new treatments might be developed with four chapters 10 13 16 17 specifically focused on novel targets novel ideas offered included studying sodium calcium exchanger and ryanodine receptor effects one chapter 5 is dedicated to examining the targets on which existing drugs operate and another 8 examines drugs in clinical trial at the time of publication the chemical structure of existing drugs is not covered overall the book advocates for segregating drug targets by disease type and state rather than the conventional approach of segregating by likelihood to harm in addition to pharmacological therapies the book examines potential alternate treatments to arrhythmia including the effect of endurance training on susceptibility it also investigates omega 3 fatty acids which have a proven effect on cardiac electrophysiology but have failed to prove protective when

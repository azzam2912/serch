a hydrastor storage system can be composed of multiple nodes starting from one up to 100 nodes each node contains standard hardware including disk drives cpu memory and network interfaces and is integrated with the hydrastor software into a single storage pool hydrastor software incorporates multiple features of distributed storage systems content addressable storage global data deduplication variable block size rabin fingerprinting erasure codes data encryption and load balancing hydrastor project was started in 2002 by cezary dubnicki and cristian ungureanu in nec research in princeton nj prototype version was implemented and evaluated in 2004 after another 3 years of development first version of hydrastor was brought to the market in us and japan subsequent version with improved software and hardware were released in following years with latest version hs8 5000 providing 72tb raw storage per node up to 11 88pb of raw capacity in its maximum configuration hydrastor can be scaled from single node to 165 nodes in a multi rack grid appliance capacity and bandwidth can be scaled independently by using different types of nodes hydrastor supports online expansion with automatic data migration and with no downtime in standard configuration hydrastor provides resiliency to up to 3 concurrent

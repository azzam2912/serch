her investigation focused on computational astrophysics stellar astrophysics and exoplanets and brown dwarfs and the physical dynamics of interacting binary stars systems however her pioneering research in the tomography of interacting binary star systems and cataclysmic variable stars to predict magnetic activity and simulate gas flow is her most known work in 1977 she graduated with the degree of bsc in physics from the university of the west indies she then moved to toronto where two years later in 1979 she received the ms in space science at york university toronto and in 1986 she earned her phd in astronomy and astrophysics from the university of toronto she worked as president of commission 42 of the international astronomical union iau which deals with close binary stars was a member of the board of advisers of the caribbean institute of astronomy and a councilor of the american astronomical society she also cooperated with some projects to encourage people s engagement with science one of them was the summer experience in the eberly college of science in 2006 a six week summer programme that was designed to engage low income high school students in science research she was born in kingston jamaica

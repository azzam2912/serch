it is closely related to b pseudomallei and by multilocus sequence typing it is a subspecies of b pseudomallei b mallei evolved from b pseudomallei by selective reduction and deletions from the b pseudomallei genome unlike b pseudomallei and other genus members b mallei is nonmotile its shape is coccobacillary measuring some 1 5 3 0 m in length and 0 5 1 0 m in diameter with rounded ends wilhelm sch tz and friedrich l ffler first isolated b mallei in 1882 it was isolated from an infected liver and spleen of a horse this bacterium is also one of the first to be identified containing a type vi secretion system which is important for its pathogenicity in 1885 the german botanist and bacteriologist wilhelm zopf 1846 1909 gave the pathogen its binomial name after analyzing samples of the bacterium he further refined his observations with the pathogen in 1886 most organisms within the burkholderiaceae live in soil however b mallei does not because b mallei is an obligate mammalian pathogen it must infect a host mammal to live and to be transmitted from one host to another b mallei is very closely related to b pseudomallei being 99

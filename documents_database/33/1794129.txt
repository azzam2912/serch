they lived during the late lower cambrian and species occurred on all paleocontinents palmer and repina assigned gabriellus and callavia to the olenelloidea but the ocular lobes in these two genera circumscribe the entire lateral border of the frontal lobe of the glabella and thus do not belong to this superfamily but to the judomioidea geyer assigned cambropallas to the olenelloidea but it lacks the diagnostic features and appears to be closely related to andalusiana and is now considered to be an advanced member of the nevadioidea in western laurentia fallotaspididae and archaeaspididae proceed the first olenelloidea the holmiidae occur at the late atdabanian and are contemporary with the nevadioidea they are followed by biceratopsidae and olenellidae as with most early trilobites the olenelloidea have an almost flat exoskeleton that is only thinly calcified and has crescent shaped eye ridges as part of the olenellina suborder the olenelloidea lack dorsal sutures the superfamily can be distinguished from all other olenellina by features of the cephalon and in particular the glabella the backward portion of the third lateral lobe of the glabella counted from the back l3 bulges laterally relative to the first lateral lobe l1 the front end of the

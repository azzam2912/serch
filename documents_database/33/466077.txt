life may be generated directly on a planet or satellite endogenously or be transferred to it from another body a hypothetical process known as panspermia environments do not need to contain life to be considered habitable nor are accepted habitable zones the only areas in which life might arise as the existence of life beyond earth is unknown planetary habitability is largely an extrapolation of conditions on earth and the characteristics of the sun and solar system which appear favorable to life s flourishing of particular interest are those factors that have sustained complex multicellular organisms on earth and not just simpler unicellular creatures research and theory in this regard is a component of a number of natural sciences such as astronomy planetary science and the emerging discipline of astrobiology an absolute requirement for life is an energy source and the notion of planetary habitability implies that many other geophysical geochemical and astrophysical criteria must be met before an astronomical body can support life in its astrobiology roadmap nasa has defined the principal habitability criteria as extended regions of liquid water conditions favorable for the assembly of complex organic molecules and energy sources to sustain metabolism in august 2018 researchers

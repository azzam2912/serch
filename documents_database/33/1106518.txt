in addition to the n terminus kinase domain there are two conserved polo box regions of 30 amino acids at the c terminus kinase activity is regulated at least in part by the polo boxes that are functionally important for both auto inhibition and subcellular localization during interphase plk1 localizes to centrosomes in early mitosis it associates with mitotic spindle poles a recombinant gfp plk1 protein localizes to centromere kinetochore region suggesting a possible role for chromosome separation plk1 is an early trigger for g2 m transition plk1 supports the functional maturation of the centrosome in late g2 early prophase and establishment of the bipolar spindle plk1 phosphorylates and activates cdc25c a phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates the cyclinb cdc2 complex plk phosphorylates and activates components of the anaphase promoting complex apc the apc which is activated by fizzy cdc20 family proteins is a cell cycle ubiquitin protein ligase e3 that degrades mitotic cyclins chromosomal proteins that maintain cohesion of sister chromatids and anaphase inhibitors abnormal spindle asp a polo kinase substrate is a microtubule associated protein essential for correct behavior of spindle poles and m phase microtubules plk1 localizes to the central region of the spindle in late mitosis

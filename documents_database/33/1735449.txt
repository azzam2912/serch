when this plume comes into contact with the neighboring ocean water its extremely cold temperature causes ice to instantly form around the flow this creates a hollow stalactite or icicle referred to as a brinicle the formation of ice from salt water produces marked changes in the composition of the nearby unfrozen water when water freezes most impurities are excluded from the water crystals even ice from seawater is relatively fresh compared with the seawater from which it is formed as a result of forcing the impurities out such as salt and other ions sea ice is very porous and spongelike quite different from the solid ice produced when fresh water freezes as the seawater freezes and salt is forced out of the pure ice crystal lattice the surrounding water becomes more saline as concentrated brine leaks out this lowers its freezing temperature and increases its density lowering the freezing temperature allows this surrounding brine rich water to remain liquid and not freeze immediately the increase in density causes this layer to sink tiny tunnels called brine channels are created all through the ice as this supersaline supercooled water sinks away from the frozen pure water the stage is now

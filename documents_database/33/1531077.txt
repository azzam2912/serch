the group is sometimes referred to as the tree flutes honeycombed lichens or hole punch lichens the most obvious morphological feature of the genus is the distinctive perforations spread across the upper side of the thallus this makes the group easy to recognise even for those not particularly familiar with lichen identification the genus has a sub cosmopolitan distribution excluding antarctica but is concentrated in australasia melanesia and southern south america most species grow exclusively on trees but some grow on rocks moss and or soil menegazzia was described by the veronese lichenologist abramo massalongo in 1854 he named it after his friend luigi menegazzi who was a distinguished naturalist in his own right placement of menegazzia within the parmeliaceae has now been confirmed by several molecular studies however the exact position of the genus within the parmeliaceae remains uncertain it is unplaced within the parmeliaceae previously the morphologically similar genus hypogymnia was thought to be the sister genus to menegazzia with some authors even separating these two genera into a family of their own the hypogymniaceae however no molecular phylogenies to date have supported this grouping there are three accepted subgenera within menegazzia dispora octospora and megamenegazzia however the

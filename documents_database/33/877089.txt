these properties combined with its high strength and low density make it ideal for special applications like coating blades in gas turbines and jet engines in 2005 the most abrasion resistant material was reportedly created by embedding diamonds in a matrix of nickel aluminide an alloy of nial known as ic 221m is made up of nickel aluminide combined with several other metals including chromium molybdenum zirconium and boron adding boron increases the ductility of the alloy by positively altering the grain boundary chemistry and promoting grain refinement the hall petch parameters for this material were 163 mpa and k 8 2 mpa cm boron increases the hardness of bulk nial by a similar mechanism this alloy is extremely strong for its weight five times stronger than common sae 304 stainless steel unlike most alloys ic 221m increases in strength from room temperature up to 800 c the alloy is very resistant to heat and corrosion and finds use in heat treating furnaces and other applications where its longer lifespan and reduced corrosion give it an advantage over stainless steel

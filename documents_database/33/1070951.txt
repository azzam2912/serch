it was a semi finalist at the mars scout program along with four other missions in december 2002 the scim mission would be designed to skim through the mars atmosphere without landing or entering orbit it would collect samples in an aerogel and take them back to earth on a free return trajectory the success of fellow discovery program mission stardust was noted as supporting future sample return missions and in particular supporting the scim concept this stardust mission was similar in that it returned extraterrestrial material to earth with an unmanned robotic spacecraft scim would collect air and dust samples by flying through the atmosphere of mars without landing or orbiting the design utilizes heritage from the successful stardust and genesis sample return missions a pass through the atmosphere about above mars surface at a speed of 6 km s would result in millions of particles being encountered the particles would be collected in an aerogel and returned to earth inside a small sealed capsule analysis of the dust could confirm the origin of the suspected meteorites on earth from mars scim was studied in 2002 for the 2007 mars scout program mission as a relatively low cost low

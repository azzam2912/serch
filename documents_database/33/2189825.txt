the diperiodatonickelates with nickel in the 4 oxidation state are powerful oxidising agents that are capable of oxidising bromate to perbromate sodium nickel periodate naniio 0 5ho and potassium nickel periodate kniio 0 5ho were discovered in 1949 by p ray and b sarma these double salts are coloured dark purple the salts were made by oxidising nickel sulfate mixed with potassium periodate or sodium periodate with the alkali persulfate salt in boiling water similar solids exist for other alkalis such as rbniio 0 5ho csniio 0 5ho and nhniio 0 5ho the crystalline salts are insoluble in water acids or bases ozone can also be used as the oxidiser the colour is due to absorbance of visible light shorter than 800 nm with a peak at 540 nm the crystal structure of all the solids has space group p 312 it contains layers of hexagon arrangements of oxygen in every second layer the alkali atoms fill one third of the holes and in the alternative layers iodine and nickel fill two thirds of the holes analogous mixed periodates also exist for some other tetravalent metals including manganese germanium tin and lead the diperiodatonickelates also known as dihydroxydiperiodatonickelates contain nickel

b bifarius inhabits mountainous regions of western north america its common name refers to the two dominant color polymorphisms the nominate and nearcticus polymorphisms present in the species b bifarius has been identified as one of the two species of bumblebee observed to use pheromones in kin recognition the other is the frigid bumblebee bombus frigidus bombus bifarius was first described by ezra townsend cresson in the 1878 proceedings of the academy of natural sciences of philadelphia it is a member of the order hymenoptera and the family apidae which also includes orchid bees honey bees and bumblebees b bifarius expresses many major color patterns with the two most observed being the nominate and nearcticus color patterns nominate b bifarius are found from colorado all the way north to british columbia while the nearcticus color pattern are primarily found in western canada alaska california oregon idaho montana and washington because of these color polymorphisms and differences in genetic structuring between populations of b bifarius in various geographic locations there has been debate as to the future of the taxonomy of these two major color pattern polymorphisms while currently these two polymorphisms are considered patterns of the same species genetic evidence

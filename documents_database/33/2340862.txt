her research combines bioinformatics computational biology and systems biology specifically in the fields of gene regulation in bacteria and eukaryotes margalit earned her b sc degree in mathematics and biology 1974 and msc degree in genetics with distinction 1977 from the hebrew university of jerusalem in 1985 she completed her phd in computational molecular biology under the supervision of norman grover the hebrew university of jerusalem margalit completed postdoctoral research at the national institutes of health nih in the laboratory of mathematical biology under the supervision of charles delisi where she developed the first computational algorithm to predict antigenic peptides recognized by immune cells in 1989 she returned to israel and established her independent research group at the faculty of medicine the hebrew university of jerusalem her early research included development of computational algorithms for predicting binding of antigenic peptides to mhc molecules computational models of protein dna binding preferences also in collaboration with nir friedman identification of domain pairs as the building blocks of protein protein interaction networks analysis of the integrated network of protein protein and protein dna interactions in collaboration with uri alon as well as computational models for predicting small regulatory rna molecules in bacteria which

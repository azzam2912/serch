it is the first described disorder of creatine metabolism and results from deficient activity of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase an enzyme involved in the synthesis of creatine clinically affected individuals often present with hypotonia seizures and developmental delay diagnosis can be suspected on clinical findings and confirmed by specific biochemical tests brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy or genetic testing biallelic pathogenic variants in gamt are the underlying cause of the disorder after gamt deficiency is diagnosed it can be treated by dietary adjustments including supplementation with creatine treatment is highly effective if started early in life if treatment is started late it cannot reverse brain damage which has already taken place individuals with gamt deficiency appear normal at birth shortly after birth infants may start to show signs as the consequences of decreased creatine levels in their body become more apparent these clinical findings are relatively non specific and do not immediately suggest a disorder of creatine metabolism common clinical findings as with other cerebral creatine deficiencies include developmental delay both intellectual and motor seizures and hypotonia speech delay autism and self injurious behaviour have also been described biallelic pathogenic variants in gamt are associated with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency this gene codes for

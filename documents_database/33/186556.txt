the mathematical existence of such sets is construed to provide information about the notions of length area and volume in formal set theory the notion of a non measurable set has been a source of great controversy since its introduction historically this led borel and kolmogorov to formulate probability theory on sets which are constrained to be measurable the measurable sets on the line are iterated countable unions and intersections of intervals called borel sets plus minus null sets these sets are rich enough to include every conceivable definition of a set that arises in standard mathematics but they require a lot of formalism to prove that sets are measurable in 1970 solovay constructed solovay s model which shows that it is consistent with standard set theory excluding uncountable choice that all subsets of the reals are measurable the first indication that there might be a problem in defining length for an arbitrary set came from vitali s theorem when you form the union of two disjoint sets one would expect the measure of the result to be the sum of the measure of the two sets a measure with this natural property is called finitely additive while a finitely

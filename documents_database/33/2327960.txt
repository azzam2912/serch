dirichlet s basic idea was to reduce euler equations to a system of ordinary differential equations such that the position of a fluid particle in a homogeneous ellipsoid at any time is a linear and homogeneous function of initial position of the fluid particle using lagrangian framework instead of the eulerian framework in the winter of 1856 57 dirichlet found some solutions of euler equations and he presented those in his lectures on partial differential equations in july 1857 and published the results in the same month his work was left unfinished at his sudden death in 1859 but his notes were collated and published by richard dedekind posthumously in 1860 bernhard riemann said in his posthumous paper edited for publication by dedekind dirichlet has opened up in a most remarkable way an entirely new avenue for investigations on the motion of a self gravitating homogeneous ellipsoid the further development of his beautiful discovery has a particular interest to the mathematician even apart from its relevance to the forms of heavenly bodies which initially instigated these investigations dirichlet s problem is generalized by bernhard riemann in 1860 and by norman r lebovitz in modern form in 1965 let formula 1

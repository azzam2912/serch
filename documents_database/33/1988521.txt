it grows on dung or compost rotten organics it is notable for being a eukaryote with a high temperature tolerance 60 c its optimal growth temperature is 50 55 c chaetomium thermophilum is a focus of research at the biochemistry department at heidelberg university germany since fungi are eukaryotic and not distant from animals they are good models for comparative and easy to manipulate research and in the case of c thermophilum it is of special significance first given the fact it is thermophilic proteins derived from this fungus are heat stable and thus easier to work with proteins from c thermophilum are thermophilic and thus better for studies structural and biochemical than comparable mesophilic fungi studying nuclear pore complex proteins it was found that protein isolation was more abundant and more soluble than in yeast yeast proteins precipitate at a lower temperature the genome of c thermophilum has been completely sequenced it spans 28 3 mb and encodes 7227 predicted protein coding genes saccharomyces cerevisiae a model yeast has 73 protein homology to this fungus the proteome of c thermophilum has been studied and 27 distinct protein communities including 108 interconnected complexes have been identified the first observation of

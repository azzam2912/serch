the massive ordnance penetrator and the improved version of the gbu 28 bomb known as egbu 28 it was developed by the us air force at the eglin air force munitions directorate it uses only materials domestic to the usa in particular it requires no tungsten the development of this steel was directed to find a low cost replacement for strong and tough but expensive superalloy steels such as af 1410 aermet 100 hy 180 and hp9 4 20 30 a high performance casing material is required so the weapon survives the high impact speeds required for deep penetration the material has a wide range of other applications from missile parts and tank bodies to machine parts an earlier material eglin steel es 1 resolved these issues but the tungsten used in it was expensive difficult to melt and the resulting tungsten carbide particles made the material difficult to process in thick sections however the tungsten also gave es 1 excellent high temperature strength these materials can be less expensive because they can be ladle refined they do not require vacuum processing unlike some other high performance alloys they can be welded easily broadening the range of applications also these

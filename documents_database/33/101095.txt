it derives its mass from its coupling to the higgs boson this coupling formula 1 is very close to unity and is the largest strongest coupling in the standard model at the scale of the weak interactions and above the top quark was discovered in 1995 by the cdf and d experiments at fermilab like all other quarks the top quark is a fermion with spin and participates in all four fundamental interactions gravitation electromagnetism weak interactions and strong interactions it has an electric charge of e it has a mass of 173 0 0 4 which is about the same mass as an atom of rhenium the antiparticle of the top quark is the top antiquark symbol sometimes called antitop quark or simply antitop which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign the top quark interacts with gluons of the strong interaction and is typically produced in hadron colliders via this interaction however once produced the top or antitop can decay only through the weak force it decays to a w boson and either a bottom quark most frequently a strange quark or on the rarest of occasions a down

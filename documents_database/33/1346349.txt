his research and teaching area is closed loop flow control for transport systems focus is placed on machine learning control and model based nonlinear control using reduced order modelling and nonlinear attractor closures currently investigated configurations include wakes mixing layers jets combustor mixing and aerodynamic flows around cars and airplanes another main area is thermodynamic formalisms for turbulence modeling he received his degree as diplom physicist from the georg august university g ttingen in 1989 he stayed on to receive his physics doctorate in 1992 under helmut eckelmann in the sequel he had positions at the max planck institut f r str mungsforschung g ttingen the german aerospace center g ttingen the g ttingen university and the united technologies research center east hartford ct usa before he joined the berlin institute of technology there professor noack has headed the group reduced order modelling for flow control at the school v transport and machine systems currently he is director of research cnrs at laboratoire d informatique pour la m canique et les sciences de l ing nieur limsi paris saclay france and professor at the technische universit t braunschweig germany honorary professor at the berlin university of technology and visiting professor

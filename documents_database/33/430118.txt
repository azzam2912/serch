there are two main types of security parameter computational and statistical often denoted by formula 1 and formula 2 respectively roughly speaking the computational security parameter is a measure for the input size of the computational problem on which the cryptographic scheme is based which determines its computational complexity whereas the statistical security parameter is a measure of the probability with which an adversary can break the scheme whatever that means for the protocol security parameters are usually expressed in unary representation i e formula 1 is expressed as a string of formula 1 formula 5s formula 6 conventionally written as formula 7 so that the time complexity of the cryptographic algorithm is polynomial in the size of the input the security of cryptographic primitives relies on the hardness of some hard problem one sets the computational security parameter formula 1 such that formula 9 computation is considered intractable security in cryptography often relies on the fact that statistical distance between is small we formalise this using the statistical security parameter by saying that the distributions are statistically close if the statistical distance between distributions can be expressed as a negligible function in the security parameter one sets the computational

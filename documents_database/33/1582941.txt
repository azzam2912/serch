the field is one of many new informatics sub specialities that uses the science of information the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems to advance a biophysical science or engineering field agricultural productivity increases are eagerly sought by governments and industry spurred by the realisation that world food production must double in the 21st century to feed growing populations and that as irrigation makes up 36 of global food production but that new land for irrigation growth is very limited irrigation efficiency must increase since irrigation science is a mature and stable field irrigation researchers are looking to cross disciplinary science to bring about production gains and informatics is one such science along with others such as social science much of the driver for work in the area of irrigation informatics is the perceived success of other informatics fields such as health informatics irrigation informatics is very much a part of the wider research into irrigation wherever information technology or data systems are used however the term informatics is not always used to describe research involving computer systems and data management so that information science or information technology may alternatively be used this leads to a

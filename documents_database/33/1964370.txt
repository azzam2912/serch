the text was in french and said to be a french translation of a sanskrit original voltaire was enthusiastic about the work had it copied and brought it to the attention of others it was first published in 1778 voltaire died that same year the genuineness of the ezourvedam was first questioned in 1782 these doubts were confirmed in 1822 rather than an original sanskrit work the ezourvedam turned out to be a french text written by french jesuits and meant to be translated into sanskrit the name ezourvedam was sometimes taken to be a corruption of yajurveda but the ezourvedam has nothing in common with the yajurveda the ezourvedam itself refers to the yajurveda as zozu vedam ezour is the sandhi form of ezous that is jezus based on the latin pronunciation used by the jesuits the name ezourvedam means something like gospel of jesus ezourvedam is a french text in the form of a dialogue between two vedic sages one monotheist and one polytheist they conclude the monotheism of pristine hinduism points to christian truth and hinduism is monotheism masquerading as polytheism concealing monotheism

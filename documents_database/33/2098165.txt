as was the case with many v 2 influenced engines the single turbine was driven by steam generated by catalytic decomposition of ho it also had four combustion chambers and vector control was achieved by refractory vanes protruding into the nozzle s exhaust after the world war ii the soviet engineers tried to absorb and further develop the german rocketry technology for the requirements to have storable propellants and higher thrust glushko s okb 456 developed the rd 211 which had four combustion chambers each having twice the thrust of the rd 100 itself a russian adaptation of the v 2 a 4 engine the four chambers were fed from a single turbopump which also like its german inspiration was feed by steam generated from catalytic decomposition of ho when then came the requirement for the buran cruise missile project a version for that application was developed in the rd 212 regrettably both rd 211 and rd 212 proved too weak for the application and the project were abandoned for the rd 213 for buran when yangel s okb 586 was tasked with developing the first storable propellant ballistic missile in the soviet arsenal the rd 211 proved too weak

bodipy is composed of dipyrromethene complexed with a disubstituted boron center typically bf the iupac name for the bodipy core is 4 4 difluoro 4 bora 3a 4a diaza s indacene reflecting its instability the unsubstituted bodipy dye had not been prepared until 2009 bodipy dyes have been well investigated most bodipy dyes have small stokes shift and are relatively chemically inert fluorescence is quenched in a solution which limits application this problem has been handled by synthesizing asymmetric boron complexes and replacing the fluorine groups with phenyl groups bodipy dyes are notable for their uniquely small stokes shift high environment independent fluorescence quantum yields often approaching 100 even in water sharp excitation and emission peaks contributing to overall brightness and high solubility in many organic solvents the combination of these qualities makes bodipy fluorophores promising for imaging applications the position of the absorption and emission bands remain almost unchanged in solvents of different polarity as the dipole moment and transition dipole are mutually orthogonal bodipy are prepared by treating a dipyrromethene precursor with boron trifluoride etherate in the presence of a tertiary amine dipyrromethenes are accessed from a suitable pyrrole by several methods normally one alpha position in employed

it is broadly divided into the northern domestic airspace nda and the southern domestic airspace sda there are three main differences between the two areas the most important of them being that the nda is designated as a standard pressure region while the sda is an altimeter setting region this means that pilots operating in the sda will calibrate their altimeters to atmospheric pressure according to information available at airports and through weather services conversely in the nda pilots calibrate their altimeters to regardless of the actual atmospheric pressure this is done because weather information is not available for all areas of the far north so it is better that all pilots use a standard setting in order to avoid collisions another major difference between the nda and sda is that magnetic declination is not used in the nda because the magnetic north pole is in the nda magnetic declinations are very large sometimes even 180 this is further complicated by the fact that magnetic north moves approximately in an elliptical path every day for these reasons true tracks are always used in the nda while magnetic tracks are frequently used in the sda for convenience the final difference between

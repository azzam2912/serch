the enzyme 5 reductase catalyzes the formation of dht from testosterone in certain tissues including the prostate gland seminal vesicles epididymides skin hair follicles liver and brain this enzyme mediates reduction of the c4 5 double bond of testosterone relative to testosterone dht is considerably more potent as an agonist of the androgen receptor ar in addition to its role as a natural hormone dht has been used as a medication for instance in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men for information on dht as a medication see the androstanolone article dht is biologically important for sexual differentiation of the male genitalia during embryogenesis maturation of the penis and scrotum at puberty growth of facial body and pubic hair and development and maintenance of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles it is produced from the less potent testosterone by the enzyme 5 reductase in select tissues and is the primary androgen in the genitals prostate gland seminal vesicles skin and hair follicles dht signals mainly in an intracrine and paracrine manner in the tissues in which it is produced playing only a minor role if any as a circulating endocrine hormone circulating levels of dht are 1 10th

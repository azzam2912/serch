using stocking models derived from the study of old growth forests selection cutting also known as selection system or selection silviculture manages the establishment continued growth and final harvest of multiple age classes usually three but 5 or even 10 are possible of trees within a stand a closely related approach to forest management is continuous cover forestry ccf which makes use of selection systems to achieve a permanently irregular stand structure selection cutting or systems are generally considered to be more challenging to implement and maintain than even aged management due to the difficulty of managing multiple age classes in a shared space but there are significant ecological benefits associated with it uneven aged stands generally exhibit higher levels of vertical structure key for many species of birds and mammals have higher levels of carbon sequestration and produce a more constant flow of market and non market forest resources than even aged stands although a forest composed of many stands with varied maturity ages maybe comparable this would be at the forest rather than the stand level this silvicultural method also protects forest soils from the adverse effects of many types of even aged silviculture including nutrient loss erosion

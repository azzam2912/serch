the resulting rapidly varying electric and magnetic fields may couple with electrical and electronic systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges the specific characteristics of a particular nuclear emp event vary according to a number of factors the most important of which is the altitude of the detonation the term electromagnetic pulse generally excludes optical infrared visible ultraviolet and ionizing such as x ray and gamma radiation ranges in military terminology a nuclear warhead detonated tens to hundreds of kilometers above the earth s surface is known as a high altitude electromagnetic pulse hemp device effects of a hemp device depend on factors including the altitude of the detonation energy yield gamma ray output interactions with the earth s magnetic field and electromagnetic shielding of targets the fact that an electromagnetic pulse is produced by a nuclear explosion was known in the earliest days of nuclear weapons testing the magnitude of the emp and the significance of its effects however were not immediately realized during the first united states nuclear test on 16 july 1945 electronic equipment was shielded because enrico fermi expected the electromagnetic pulse the official technical history for that first nuclear test states all signal lines

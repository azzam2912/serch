in images four orientations of such a triangle are by far the most common they can conveniently be referred to by viewing the triangle as an arrow as pointing up down to the left or to the right although in each case they could also be considered to point into two oblique directions two orientations of an image of the lattice are by far the most common they can conveniently be referred to as hexagonal lattice with horizontal rows like in the figure below with triangles pointing up and down and hexagonal lattice with vertical rows with triangles pointing left and right they differ by an angle of 30 the hexagonal lattice with horizontal rows is a special case of a centered rectangular i e rhombic grid with rectangles which are times as high as wide of course for the other orientation the rectangles are times as wide as high its symmetry category is wallpaper group p6m a pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself for an image of a honeycomb structure again two orientations are by far the most common they can conveniently be referred to as

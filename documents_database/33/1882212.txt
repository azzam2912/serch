they also allow for explicit root finding and detection of zero crossing using explicit algorithms avoiding the need for iteration a fact which is especially important in the case of stiff systems where traditional time stepping methods require a heavy computational penalty due to the requirement to implicitly solve for the next system state finally qss methods satisfy remarkable global stability and error bounds described below which are not satisfied by classical solution techniques by their nature qss methods are therefore neatly modeled by the devs formalism a discrete event model of computation in contrast with traditional methods which form discrete time models of the continuous time system they have therefore been implemented in powerdevs a simulation engine for such discrete event systems in 2001 ernesto kofman proved a remarkable property of the quantized state system simulation method namely that when the technique is used to solve a stable linear time invariant lti system the global error is bounded by a constant that is proportional to the quantum but crucially independent of the duration of the simulation more specifically for a stable multidimensional lti system with the state transition matrix formula 1 and input matrix formula 2 it was shown

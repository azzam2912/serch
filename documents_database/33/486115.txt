the company originally called modulus graphite was founded in part by geoff gould a bassist who also worked for an aerospace company in palo alto california the name is a reference to young s modulus a measure of the stiffness of an elastic material used in the field of solid mechanics carbon fiber has an exceptionally high modulus traditionally electric guitar and bass necks are made from hardwoods such as maple or mahogany reinforced with an adjustable steel truss rod wood being a naturally occurring material is prone to variations in density and flexibility this coupled with the high stresses created by stretching steel strings across them lengthwise makes wood necks prone to certain unpredictable and undesirable qualities among these are twisting incorrect bowing either too pronounced or too subtle and dead spots or areas on the neck where notes are quieter or more indistinct compared to other areas non traditional neck materials such as carbon fiber and aluminum are attempts to correct these issues by replacing wood with lighter stiffer and more uniform components gould was inspired to experiment with non traditional materials after attending a 1974 grateful dead concert at which he marveled at the size and complexity

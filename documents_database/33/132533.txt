similarly an order of operations is accepted according to which is applied before that is is compared to a ring a semiring omits the requirement for inverses under addition that is it requires only a commutative monoid not a commutative group in a ring this implies the existence of a multiplicative zero so here it must be specified explicitly if a semiring s multiplication is commutative then it is called a commutative semiring there are some authors who prefer to leave out the requirement that a semiring have a 0 or 1 this makes the analogy between ring and semiring on the one hand and group and semigroup on the other hand work more smoothly these authors often use rig for the concept defined here much of the theory of rings continues to make sense when applied to arbitrary semirings in particular one can generalise the theory of associative algebras over commutative rings directly to a theory of algebras over commutative semirings then a ring is simply an algebra over the commutative semiring z of integers a semiring in which every element is an additive idempotent that is a a a for all elements a is called an idempotent semirings

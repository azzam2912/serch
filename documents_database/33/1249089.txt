in reverse osmosis an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure a colligative property that is driven by chemical potential differences of the solvent a thermodynamic parameter reverse osmosis can remove many types of dissolved and suspended chemical species as well as biological ones principally bacteria from water and is used in both industrial processes and the production of potable water the result is that the solute is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure solvent is allowed to pass to the other side to be selective this membrane should not allow large molecules or ions through the pores holes but should allow smaller components of the solution such as solvent molecules i e water ho to pass freely in the normal osmosis process the solvent naturally moves from an area of low solute concentration high water potential through a membrane to an area of high solute concentration low water potential the driving force for the movement of the solvent is the reduction in the free energy of the system when the difference in solvent concentration on either side of a membrane is reduced generating osmotic pressure due to the solvent moving into the more

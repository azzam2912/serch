mazya s early achievements include his work on sobolev spaces in particular the discovery of the equivalence between sobolev and isoperimetric isocapacitary inequalities 1960 his counterexamples related to hilbert s 19th and hilbert s 20th problem 1968 his solution together with yuri burago of a problem in harmonic potential theory 1967 posed by his extension of the wiener regularity test to laplacian and the proof of its sufficiency for the boundary regularity maz ya solved vladimir arnol d s problem for the oblique derivative boundary value problem 1970 and fritz john s problem on the oscillations of a fluid in the presence of an immersed body 1977 in recent years he proved a wiener s type criterion for higher order elliptic equations together with mikhail shubin solved a problem in the spectral theory of the schr dinger operator formulated by israel gelfand in 1953 found necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of maximum principles for elliptic and parabolic systems of pdes and introduced the so called approximate approximations he also contributed to the development of the theory of capacities nonlinear potential theory the asymptotic and qualitative theory of arbitrary order elliptic equations the theory of ill posed problems the

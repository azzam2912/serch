it is used to supplement seismic monitoring for the calculation of seismic hazard paleoseismology is usually restricted to geologic regimes that have undergone continuous sediment creation for the last few thousand years such as swamps lakes river beds and shorelines in this typical example a trench is dug in an active sedimentation regime evidence of thrust faulting can be seen in the walls of the trench it becomes a matter of deducting the relative age of each fault by cross cutting patterns the faults can be dated in absolute terms if there is dateable carbon or human artifacts many notable discoveries have been made using the techniques of paleoseismology for example there is a common misconception that having many smaller earthquakes can somehow relieve a major fault such as the san andreas fault and reduce the chance of a major earthquake it is now known using paleoseismology that nearly all the movement of the fault takes place with extremely large earthquakes all of these seismic events with a moment magnitude of over 8 leave some sort of trace in the sedimentation record another famous example involves the megathrust earthquakes of the pacific northwest it was thought for some time that

the original phrase was it is certain because it is unfitting in an anti marcionite context however through early modern protestant and enlightenment rhetoric against catholicism and religion more broadly was changed to i believe because it is absurd for a personally religious context the original phrase before being transmuted through enlightenment rhetoric to its modern form i believe because it is absurd appeared in tertullian s work de carne christi read by scholars as i believe because it is unfitting the context is a defense of the tenets of orthodox christianity against docetism the consensus of tertullian scholars is that the reading i believe because it is absurd sharply diverges from tertullian s own thoughts given his placed priority on reasoned argument and rationality in his writings in the same work tertullian later writes but here again i must have some reasons elsewhere he writes that the new christian should believe nothing but that nothing should be rashly believed scholars note further examples of where tertullian acts by following a method of reasoned argument the meaning of the phrase may relate to 1 corinthians 1 17 31 where something foolish to a human may be a member of god

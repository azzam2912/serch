as a result practitioners often resort to approximate statistical methods or asymptotic statistical methods that are valid only when the sample size is large with small samples such methods often have poor performance use of approximate and asymptotic methods may lead to misleading conclusions or may fail to detect truly significant results from experiments tests based on generalized p values are exact statistical methods in that they are based on exact probability statements while conventional statistical methods do not provide exact solutions to such problems as testing variance components or anova under unequal variances exact tests for such problems can be obtained based on generalized p values in order to overcome the shortcomings of the classical p values tsui and weerahandi extended the classical definition so that one can obtain exact solutions for such problems as the behrens fisher problem and testing variance components this is accomplished by allowing test variables to depend on observable random vectors as well as their observed values as in the bayesian treatment of the problem but without having to treat constant parameters as random variables to describe the idea of generalized p values in a simple example consider a situation of sampling from a

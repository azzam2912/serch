it is similar to a hammer drill in that it also pounds the drill bit in and out while it is spinning however rotary hammers use a piston mechanism instead of a special clutch this causes them to deliver a much more powerful hammer blow making it possible to drill bigger holes much faster compared to less advanced power units known as hammer drills rotary hammers tend to be larger and provide a bigger impact force by utilizing a technology called the electro pneumatic ep hammering mechanism because it is powered directly by electricity instead of a separate air compressor rotary hammers have two pistons a drive piston and a flying piston an electric motor turns a crank which moves the drive piston back and forth in a cylinder the flying piston is at the other end of the same cylinder the pistons do not actually touch but the air pressure in the ep cylinder allows for a much more efficient transfer of hammering energy than springs in the cam action style hammer drills the majority of modern rotary hammers as well as all electric powered chipping guns or jack hammers all utilize this ep technology modern units allow the

it is sometimes called a cyclic graph but this term has other meanings circulant graphs can be described in several equivalent ways every cycle graph is a circulant graph as is every crown graph with vertices the paley graphs of order where is a prime number congruent to is a graph in which the vertices are the numbers from 0 to and two vertices are adjacent if their difference is a quadratic residue modulo since the presence or absence of an edge depends only on the difference modulo of two vertex numbers any paley graph is a circulant graph every m bius ladder is a circulant graph as is every complete graph a complete bipartite graph is a circulant graph if it has the same number of vertices on both sides of its bipartition if two numbers and are relatively prime then the rook s graph a graph that has a vertex for each square of an chessboard and an edge for each two squares that a chess rook can move between in a single move is a circulant graph this is because its symmetries include as a subgroup the cyclic group c formula 1 c c more generally in

despite the fact that there are no chemical changes to its constituents the physical properties of a mixture such as its melting point may differ from those of the components some mixtures can be separated into their components by using physical mechanical or thermal means azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually poses considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents physical or chemical processes or even a blend of them mixtures can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous a mixture in which its constituents are distributed uniformly is called homogeneous mixture such as salt in water a mixture in which its constituents are not distributed uniformly is called heterogeneous mixture such as sand in water one example of a mixture is air air is a homogeneous mixture of the gaseous substances nitrogen oxygen and smaller amounts of other substances salt sugar and many other substances dissolve in water to form homogeneous mixtures a homogeneous mixture in which there is both a solute and solvent present is also a solution mixtures can have any amounts of ingredients mixtures are unlike chemical compounds because the following table shows the main properties of the three families of mixtures and

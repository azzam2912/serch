satellite mounted microwave radiometers such ssmi amsr and amsu are an ideal tool for the task because they can see through cloud cover and they have frequent global coverage a passive microwave instrument detects objects through emitted radiation since different substance have different emission spectra to help us detect sea ice more efficiently we need to model these emission processes the interaction of sea ice with electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range is still not well understood in general is collected information limited because of the large scale variability due to the emissivity of sea ice satellite microwave data and visible infrared data depending on the conditions collected from sensors assumes that ocean surface is a binary ice covered or ice free and observations are used to quantify the radiative flux during the melt seasons in spring and summer sea ice surface temperature goes above freezing thus passive microwave measurements are able to detect rising brightness temperatures as the emissivity increases to almost that of a blackbody and as liquid starts to form around the ice crystals but when melting continues slush forms and then melt ponds and the brightness temperature goes down to that of ice free water because

eidetic reduction requires that a phenomenologist examine the essence of a mental object be it a simple mental act or the unity of consciousness itself with the intention of drawing out the absolutely necessary and invariable components that make the mental object what it is this reduction is done with the intention of removing what is perceived and leaving only what is required one can take for example descartes s piece of wax not as a mental object but as a demonstration of the concept of reduction it appears to be opaque flat hard extended to certain dimensions in space it has a certain feel smell taste most of these qualities can be negated as necessary to the piece of wax continuing to be a piece of wax the smell taste texture opacity if heated it will continue to be the same piece of wax the same molecules however the taste may change the smell may become more noticeable the texture will obviously change it will become clear if heated to the point of melting etc the only things that remain its extension into space chemical makeup and mass are the things that are required for the existence of that

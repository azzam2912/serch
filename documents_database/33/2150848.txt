with an apparent visual magnitude of 5 65 it is faintly visible to the naked eye according to the bortle scale it can be viewed from dark rural skies the high declination of 82 5 means it is hidden from view from most of the southern hemisphere parallax measurements made with the hipparcos spacecraft yield an estimated distance of around 141 light years from the sun if it was instead positioned at a distance of this would be a second magnitude star this is an f type main sequence star with a stellar classification of f9 v it is estimated to have 51 greater mass than the sun and is younger with an age of around 2 8 billion years the projected rotational velocity along the star s equator is a relatively leisurely 5 2 km s the star is considered a photometric solar analog although it is deficient in elements more massive than helium when compared to the sun the chemical composition and relatively low surface gravity for a star of its classification suggest that this may instead be a subgiant star that is in the process of evolving away from the main sequence the effective temperature of the

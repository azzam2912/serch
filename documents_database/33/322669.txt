it implies that the information of a physical system or the information necessary to perfectly describe that system must be finite if the region of space and the energy is finite in computer science this implies that there is a maximal information processing rate bremermann s limit for a physical system that has a finite size and energy and that a turing machine with finite physical dimensions and unbounded memory is not physically possible the universal form of the bound was originally found by jacob bekenstein as the inequality where s is the entropy k is boltzmann s constant r is the radius of a sphere that can enclose the given system e is the total mass energy including any rest masses is the reduced planck constant and c is the speed of light note that while gravity plays a significant role in its enforcement the expression for the bound does not contain the gravitational constant g in informational terms the bound is given by where i is the information expressed in number of bits contained in the quantum states in the sphere the ln 2 factor comes from defining the information as the logarithm to the base 2 of

they were first described by f c kenyon in 1896 the number of kenyon cells in an organism varies greatly between species for example in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster there are about 2 500 kenyon cells per mushroom body while in cockroaches there are about 230 000 while the exact features of kenyon cells can vary between species there are enough similarities to define their general structure kenyon cells have dendritic branches that arborize in the calyx or calyces cup shaped regions of the mushroom body at the base of the calyces kenyon cell axons come together and form a bundle known as the pedunculus at the end of the pedunculus kenyon cell axons bifurcate and extend branches into the vertical and medial lobes kenyon cells are mainly postsynaptic in the calyces where their synapses form microglomeruli these microglomeruli are made up of kenyon cell dendrites cholinergic boutons and gabaergic terminals antennal lobe projection neurons are the source of the cholinergic input and the gabaergic input is from protocerebral neurons kenyon cells are presynaptic to mushroom body output neurons in the lobes however the lobes are not only output regions kenyon cells are both pre and postsynaptic in these

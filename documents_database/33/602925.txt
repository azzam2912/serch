it is derived from the prepronociceptin protein as are a further 2 peptides nocistatin nocii which inhibit the n ofq receptor function nociceptin itself acts as a potent anti analgesic effectively counteracting the effect of pain relievers the gene coding for prepronociceptin is located on ch8p21 in humans nociceptin acts at the nociceptin receptor nop receptor formerly known as orl1 nociceptin is the first example of reverse pharmacology the nop receptor was discovered before the endogenous ligand which was discovered by two separate groups in 1995 since its discovery nociceptin has been of great interest to researchers nociceptin is a peptide related to the opioid class of compounds ex morphine and codeine but it does not act at the classic opioid receptors namely mu kappa and delta opioid receptors which typically act as pain relievers nociceptin is widely distributed in the cns it is found in the hypothalamus brainstem and forebrain as well as in the ventral and dorsal horns of the spinal cord the nop receptor is also widely distributed throughout areas of the brain including the cortex anterior olfactory nucleus lateral septum hypothalamus hippocampus amygdala central gray pontine nuclei interpeduncular nucleus substantia nigra raphe complex locus coeruleus and

while lf may be the result of actual photons of visible light being sensed by the retina the lf discussed here could also pertain to phosphenes which are sensations of light produced by the activation of neurons along the visual pathway researchers believe that the lf perceived specifically by astronauts in space are due to cosmic rays high energy charged particles from beyond the earth s atmosphere though the exact mechanism is unknown hypotheses include cherenkov radiation created as the cosmic ray particles pass through the vitreous humour of the astronauts eyes direct interaction with the optic nerve direct interaction with visual centres in the brain retinal receptor stimulation and a more general interaction of the retina with radiation astronauts who had recently returned from space missions to the hubble space telescope the international space station and mir space station reported seeing the lf under different conditions in order of decreasing frequency of reporting in a survey they saw the lf in the dark in dim light in bright light and one reported that he saw them regardless of light level and light adaptation they were seen mainly before sleeping some lf were reported to be clearly visible while others

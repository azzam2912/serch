cyclododecahexaene is non aromatic due to the lack of planarity of the structure on the other hand the di anion with 14 electrons is a h ckel aromat and more stable according to in silico experiments the tri trans isomer is expected to be the most stable followed by the 1 7 ditrans and the all cis isomers 1 kcal mol and by the 1 5 ditrans isomer 5 kcal mol the first 12 annulene with sym tri trans configuration was synthesized in 1970 from a tricyclic precursor by photolysis at low temperatures on heating the compound rearranges to a bicyclic 6 4 0 isomer reducing the compound at low temperatures allowed analysis of the dianion by proton nmr with the inner protons resonating at 4 5 ppm relative to tms evidence of an aromatic diamagnetic ring current in one study the 1 7 ditrans isomer is generated at low temperatures in thf by dehydrohalogenation of a hexabromocyclododecane with potassium tert butoxide reduction of this compound at low temperature with caesium metal leads first to the radical anion and then to the dianion the chemical shift for the internal protons in this compound is with 0 2 ppm much more

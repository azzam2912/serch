by definition modes of action are characterized by fats because the combination of common responses that represent each fish acute toxicity syndrome characterize an adverse biological effect therefore toxicants that have the same mode of action elicit similar sets of responses in the organism and can be classified by the same fish acute toxicity syndrome during the 1970s large scale production of chemicals dramatically increased initiating new legislation to appease public concern about potential harmful effects after implementation of the toxic substances control act in 1977 the us environmental protection agency usepa required chemicals new and existing to be assessed for risks to human health and ecological systems since thousands of new chemicals are registered a year it is important to utilize a screening technique that predicts toxicity of chemicals in a consistent efficient manner as a result researchers in the field of toxicology focused on the development of qsar models as a means of assessing toxic effects of chemicals in fish in toxicology the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar approach is a method for predicting toxicity based on the properties and structure of a toxicant this method has been developed under the assumption that a group of chemicals with

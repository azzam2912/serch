located approximately away the star varies between apparent magnitudes 6 32 and 6 42 over a period of approximately 3 74 days cg andromedae is also a chemically peculiar star with a strong magnetic field or ap star with a spectral type a0iispsisrhg this means that it s a bright giant star that shows narrow absorption lines and unusual strong lines of silicium strontium and mercury calcium and manganese lines are weaker than expected instead other sources report that the stronger lines are of silicium and europium thus giving a spectral classification b9psieu which has just a slightly different temperature for the blackbody emission in addition to the different lines like in alpha canum venaticorum variable stars cg andromedae shows a variation of luminosity and one in the strength of spectral lines with the same period of approximately 3 74 days it is thought that this is caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of elements on the surface of the star which cause an inhomogeneous surface brightness a shorter period slightly longer than 2 hours with an amplitude of 0 011 magnitudes has been observed in the light curve of cg andromedae however with a temperature of 11 000 k it

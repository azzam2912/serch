offering above average host interface throughput coupled with a moderate price tseng labs et4000 chipset family were well regarded for their performance and were integrated into many companies lineups notably with hercules dynamite series the diamond stealth 32 and several speedstar cards and on many generic boards the et4000ax was a major advancement over tseng labs earlier et3000 svga chipset featuring a new 16 bit host interface controller with deep fifo buffering and caching capabilities and an enhanced variable width memory interface with support for up to 1mb of memory with a 16 bit vram or 32 bit dram memory data bus width the fifo buffers and cache functions had the effect of greatly improving host interface throughput and therefore offering substantially improved redraw performance compared to the et3000 and most of its contemporaries the interface controller also offered support for ibm s mca bus in addition to an 8 or 16 bit isa bus the et4000ax could also support the emerging vesa local bus standard with some additional external logic albeit with a 16 bit host bus width neither the et4000ax or its succeeding family members offered an integrated ramdac which hampered the line s cost performance competitiveness later

the transmissions are picked up by receivers that are either connected to the conductors or a short distance from them carrier current transmission is used to send audio and telemetry to selected locations and also for low power broadcasting that covers a small geographical area such as a college campus the most common form of carrier current uses longwave or medium wave am radio signals that are sent through existing electrical wiring although other conductors can be used such as telephone lines carrier current generally uses low power transmissions in cases where the signals are being carried over electrical wires special preparations must be made for distant transmissions as the signals cannot pass through standard utility transformers signals can bridge transformers if the utility company has installed high pass filters which typically has already been done when carrier current based data systems are in operation signals can also be impressed onto the neutral leg of the three phase electric power system a practice known as neutral loading in order to reduce or eliminate mains hum 60 hertz in north american installations and to extend effective transmission line distance for a broadcasting installation a typical carrier current transmitter has an output

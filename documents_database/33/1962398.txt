she received her degree in 1908 with lauude and dignita di stampa which means that her work was worthy of publication and in fact her thesis sulle trasformazioni birazionali dello spazio on birational transformations in space was published in the annali di matematica pura ed applicata guido castelnuovo was very impressed with her talent and offer her the position of assistant which margherita took and held until 1919 when she moved to pavia and the successive year to palermo to work under michele de franchis an important figure of the italian school of algebraic geometry at the time in 1924 beloch completed her libera docenza a degree that at that time had to be obtained before one could become a professor and three years later she became a full professor at the university of ferrara where she taught until her retirement 1955 her main scientific interest were algebraic geometry algebraic topology and photogrammetry after her thesis she worked on classification of algebraic surfaces studying the configurations of lines that could lie on surfaces the next step was to study rational curves lying on surfaces and in this framework beloch obtained the following important result hyperelleptic surfaces of rank 2 are

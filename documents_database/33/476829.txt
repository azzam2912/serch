momentum diffusion can be attributed to either external pressure or shear stress or both when pressure is applied on an incompressible fluid the velocity of the fluid will change the fluid accelerates or decelerates depending on the relative direction of pressure with respect to the flow direction this is because applying pressure on the fluid has caused momentum diffusion in that direction understanding the exact nature of diffusion is a key aspect towards understanding momentum diffusion due to pressure a fluid flowing along a flat plate will stick to it at the point of contact and this is known as the no slip condition this is an outcome of the adhesive forces between the flat plate and the fluid the presence of the wall has an effect up to a certain distance in the fluid in the direction perpendicular to the wall area and flow and this is known as the boundary layer any layer of fluid that is not in contact with the wall will be flowing with a certain velocity and will be sandwiched between two layers of fluid now the layer just above it flowing with a greater velocity will try to drag it in the direction

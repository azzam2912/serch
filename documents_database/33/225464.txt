no real pattern exists for the numbering of highways route commissioning beyond these routes was by legislative action thus the term legislative route this included additions and revisions that took place when us and interstate highway systems were commissioned minnesota state highway markers use type d fhwa font for all route numbers and type c for three digit route markers only if type d font cannot be used all routes except interstates use or markers interstate markers for three digit routes are wider shields and respectively although minnesota state highways do not follow a distinctive pattern in numbering they are numbered to avoid conflicting with interstate highways and us highways any instance of a state number that matches one is often a continuation of the particular route e g u s route 169 and trunk highway 169 the minnesota department of transportation mndot does not consider this a violation of the rule there are also routes officially numbered in the 805 and 905 but they do not have signage examples include part of the sibley memorial highway that was bypassed in mendota in the mid 1995 mn 913a numbered for former designation mn 13 and robert street between i 494

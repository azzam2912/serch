machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on using algorithms and statistical models to make machines act without specific programming this is in sharp contrast to traditional methods of artificial intelligence such as search trees and expert systems information on machine learning techniques in the field of games is mostly known to public through research projects as most gaming companies choose not to publish specific information about their intellectual property the most publicly known application of machine learning in games is likely the use of deep learning agents that compete with professional human players in complex strategy games there has been a significant application of machine learning on games such as atari ale doom minecraft starcraft and car racing other games that did not originally exists as video games such as chess and go have also been affected by the machine learning deep learning is a subset of machine learning which focuses heavily on the use of artificial neural networks ann that learn to solve complex tasks deep learning uses multiple layers of ann and other techniques to progressively extract information from an input due to this complex layered approach deep learning models often require powerful machines

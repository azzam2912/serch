caulobacter daughter cells have two very different forms one daughter is a mobile swarmer cell that has a single flagellum at one cell pole that provides swimming motility for chemotaxis the other daughter called the stalked cell has a tubular stalk structure protruding from one pole that has an adhesive holdfast material on its end with which the stalked cell can adhere to surfaces swarmer cells differentiate into stalked cells after a short period of motility chromosome replication and cell division only occurs in the stalked cell stage its name derives from its crescent shape caused by the protein crescentin discovered by christine jacobs wagner s laboratory its use as a model originated with developmental biologist lucy shapiro in the laboratory researchers distinguish between c crescentus strain cb15 the strain originally isolated from a freshwater lake and na1000 the primary experimental strain in strain na1000 which was derived from cb15 in the 1970s the stalked and predivisional cells can be physically separated in the laboratory from new swarmer cells while cell types from strain cb15 cannot be physically separated the isolated swarmer cells can then be grown as a synchronized cell culture detailed study of the molecular development of these

the genus coxiella is morphologically similar to rickettsia but with a variety of genetic and physiological differences c burnetii is a small gram negative coccobacillary bacterium that is highly resistant to environmental stresses such as high temperature osmotic pressure and ultraviolet light these characteristics are attributed to a small cell variant form of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle including a more metabolically and replicatively active large cell variant form it can survive standard disinfectants and is resistant to many other environmental changes like those presented in the phagolysosome research in the 1920s and 1930s identified what appeared to be a new type of rickettsia isolated from ticks that was able to pass through filters the first description of what may have been coxiella burnetii was published in 1925 by hideyo noguchi but since his samples did not survive it remains unclear as to whether it was the same organism the definitive descriptions were published in the late 1930s as part of research into the cause of q fever by edward holbrook derrick and macfarlane burnet in australia and herald rea cox and gordon davis at the rocky mountain laboratory rml in the united states the

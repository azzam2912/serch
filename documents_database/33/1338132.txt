a group of 40 activists of the sri rama sena barged into the pub amnesia the lounge and beat up a group of young women and men claiming the women were violating traditional indian values two of the women were hospitalised the video of the incident has become one of the most watched clips on youtube though how the tv crew happened to be ready at the unannounced attack is not known according to statements of staff at the amnesia pub at the hotel woodside in the busy balmatta area of mangalore two men approached the front desk of the hotel an hour before the actual attack took place at 4 30 pm on saturday reportedly claiming rights to inspect the premises however local police officials claimed the hotel staff had not made any reference to an extortion attempt or on previous occasions the police also suspect that the real hidden agenda could have been extortion the fact is that by claiming responsibility a group will be able to extort money from similar establishments later whoever has done this has done a good job girls going to pubs is not acceptable so whatever the sena members did was right you

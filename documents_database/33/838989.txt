islanding can be dangerous to utility workers who may not realize that a circuit is still powered and it may prevent automatic re connection of devices additionally without strict frequency control the balance between load and generation in the islanded circuit is going to be violated leading to abnormal frequencies and voltages for those reasons distributed generators must detect islanding and immediately disconnect from the circuit this is referred to as anti islanding a common example of islanding is a distribution feeder that has solar panels attached to it in the case of a power outage the solar panels will continue to deliver power as long as irradiance is sufficient in this case the circuit detached by the outage becomes an island for this reason solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have some sort of automatic anti islanding circuitry some designs commonly known as a microgrid allow for intentional islanding in case of an outage a microgrid controller disconnects the local circuit from the grid on a dedicated switch and forces the distributed generator s to power the entire local load in the context of nuclear power plants islanding is an

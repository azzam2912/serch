trk receptors affect neuronal survival and differentiation through several signaling cascades however the activation of these receptors also has significant effects on functional properties of neurons the common ligands of trk receptors are neurotrophins a family of growth factors critical to the functioning of the nervous system the binding of these molecules is highly specific each type of neurotrophin has different binding affinity toward its corresponding trk receptor the activation of trk receptors by neurotrophin binding may lead to activation of signal cascades resulting in promoting survival and other functional regulation of cells the abbreviation trk often pronounced track stands for tropomyosin receptor kinase or tyrosine receptor kinase and not tyrosine kinase receptor nor tropomyosin related kinase as has been commonly mistaken the family of trk receptors is named for the oncogene trk whose identification led to the discovery of its first member trka trk initially identified in a colon carcinoma is frequently 25 activated in thyroid papillary carcinomas the oncogene was generated by a mutation in chromosome 1 that resulted in the fusion of the first seven exons of tropomyosin to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the then unknown trka receptor normal trk receptors do not contain amino

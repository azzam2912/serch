the term schema refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed divided into database tables in the case of relational databases the formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas sentences called integrity constraints imposed on a database these integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema all constraints are expressible in the same language a database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language the states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping the database schema this describes how real world entities are modeled in the database a database schema specifies based on the database administrator s knowledge of possible applications the facts that can enter the database or those of interest to the possible end users the notion of a database schema plays the same role as the notion of theory in predicate calculus a model of this theory closely corresponds to a database which can be seen at any instant of time as a mathematical object thus a schema can contain formulas representing integrity constraints specifically for an application and the constraints specifically for a type of database all

the mfs family was originally believed to function primarily in the uptake of sugars but subsequent studies revealed that drugs metabolites oligosaccharides amino acids and oxyanions were all transported by mfs family members these protein energetically drive transport utilizing the electrochemical gradient of the target substrate uniporter or act as a cotransporter where transport is coupled to the movement of a second substrate the basic fold of the mfs transporter is built around 12 transmembrane helices tmh with two 6 helix bundles formed by the n and c terminal homologus domains of the transporter which are connected by an extended cytoplasmic loop the two halves of the protein pack against each other in a clam shell fashion sealing via interactions at the ends of the transmembrane helices and extracellular loops this forms a large aqueous cavity at the center of the membrane which is alternatively open to the cytoplasm or periplasm extracellular space lining this aqueous cavity are the amino acids which bind the substrate s and define transporter specificity many mfs transporters are thought to be dimers through in vitro and in vivo methods with some evidence to suggest a functional role for this oligomerization the alternating access mechanism

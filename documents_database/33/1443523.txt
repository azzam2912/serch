the technique justifies the otherwise phenomenological constitutive relations appearing in hydrodynamical descriptions such as the navier stokes equations in doing so expressions for various transport coefficients such as thermal conductivity and viscosity are obtained in terms of molecular parameters thus chapman enskog theory constitutes an important step in the passage from a microscopic particle based description to a continuum hydrodynamical one the theory is named for sydney chapman and david enskog who introduced it independently in 1916 and 1917 the starting point of chapman enskog theory is the boltzmann equation for the 1 particle distribution function formula 1 where formula 3 is a nonlinear integral operator which models the evolution of formula 4 under interparticle collisions this nonlinearity makes solving the full boltzmann equation difficult and motivates the development of approximate techniques such as the one provided by chapman enskog theory given this starting point the various assumptions underlying the boltzmann equation carry over to chapman enskog theory as well the most basic of these requires a separation of scale between the collision duration formula 5 and the mean free time between collisions formula 6 formula 7 this condition ensures that collisions are well defined events in space and time

the replaced function does not have to be related to life support but it often is for example replacement bones and joints such as those found in hip replacements could also be considered artificial organs implied by definition is that the device must not be continuously tethered to a stationary power supply or other stationary resources such as filters or chemical processing units periodic rapid recharging of batteries refilling of chemicals and or cleaning replacing of filters would exclude a device from being called an artificial organ thus a dialysis machine while a very successful and critically important life support device that almost completely replaces the duties of a kidney is not an artificial organ constructing and installing artificial organs an extremely research intensive and expensive process initially may entail many years of ongoing maintenance services not needed by a natural organ the use of any artificial organ by humans is almost always preceded by extensive experiments with animals initial testing in humans is frequently limited to those either already facing death or who have exhausted every other treatment possibility artificial arms and legs or prosthetics are intended to restore a degree of normal function to amputees mechanical devices that

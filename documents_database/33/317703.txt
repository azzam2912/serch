if one starts on any equal tempered pitch and repeatedly ascends by the musical interval of a semitone one will eventually land on a pitch with the same pitch class as the initial one having passed through all the other equal tempered chromatic pitch classes in between since the space is circular it is also possible to descend by semitone the chromatic circle is useful because it represents melodic distance which is often correlated with physical distance on musical instruments for instance to move from any c on a piano keyboard to the nearest e one must move up four semitones corresponding to four clockwise steps on the chromatic circle one can also move down by eight semitones corresponding to eight counterclockwise steps on the pitch class circle larger motions on the piano or in pitch space can be represented in pitch class space by paths that wrap around the chromatic circle one or more times one can represent the twelve equal tempered pitch classes by the cyclic group of order twelve or equivalently the residue classes modulo twelve z 12z the group formula 1 has four generators which can be identified with the ascending and descending semitones and the

it allows the hosting of multiple applications of different software levels on the same hardware in the context of an integrated modular avionics architecture it is part of arinc 600 series standards for digital aircraft flight simulators in order to decouple the real time operating system platform from the application software arinc 653 defines an api called application executive apex each application software is called a partition and has its own memory space it also has a dedicated time slot allocated by the apex api within each partition multitasking is allowed the apex api provides services to manage partitions processes and timing as well as partition process communication and error handling the partitioning environment can be implemented by using a hypervisor to map partitions to virtual machines but this is not required the current work of the aeec apex subcommittee includes the enhancement of arinc 653 for multicore processor architectures the initial version of arinc 653 was published on october 10 1996 supplement 1 was published on january 1997 and introduced the concepts of apex and time and space partitioning supplement 2 was published in 3 parts between march 2006 and january 2007 an arinc 653 platform contains initialization of

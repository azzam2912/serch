like the standard o ring chains it is also used in high performance motorcycles it uses x ring seal to keep lubricant usually grease in place it has higher performance in terms of durability lifetime and power loss than non o ring chains as it has less friction than o ring chain while providing adequate lubrication and protection against foreign elements which also increases reliability it can last twice as long as the o ring chain under some circumstances the x ring chain is developed from o ring chain which in turn is developed from non o ring chain while the regular o ring chain has high durability it also has more friction compared to other types of roller chains due to distortion of the o ring due to pressure from the inner and outer chain plates this results in loss of power in the transmission therefore x ring chain was developed by replacing o ring seal with x ring seal which greatly reduced friction and increased durability like the o ring chain it has sealing rings which keep the contaminant dirt out and lubricant in between the pins and bushings this is known as internal lubrication however unlike o

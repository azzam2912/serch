dde allows programs to manipulate objects provided by other programs for example a cell in an embedded microsoft excel spreadsheet and respond to user actions affecting those objects internally dde is implemented in terms of windows message passing architecture which leaves it vulnerable to malformed third party programs dde is partially superseded by object linking and embedding ole and is currently maintained in windows systems only for the sake of backwards compatibility dynamic data exchange was first introduced in 1987 with the release of windows 2 0 as a method of interprocess communication so that one program could communicate with or control another program somewhat like sun s rpc remote procedure call at the time the only method for communication between the operating system and client applications was the windows messaging layer dde extended this protocol to allow peer to peer communication among client applications via message broadcasts because dde runs via message broadcasts it is vulnerable to and window management code that does not pump messages this problem was not considered during the design of dde because dde predates pre emptive multitasking moreover any code managing a window handle can respond to a dde broadcast the initiator of dde

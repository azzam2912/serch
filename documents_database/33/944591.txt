the use of the word eventually is equivalent to the use of the quantifier almost all this can be extended to the class of properties p that apply to elements of any ordered set sequences and subsets of r are ordered for example often when looking at infinite sequences it does not matter too much what behaviour the sequence exhibits early on what matters is what the sequence does in the long term the idea of having a property eventually rigorizes this viewpoint for example the definition of a sequence of real numbers formula 1 converging to some limit formula 3 is for all formula 4 there exists formula 5 such that for all formula 6 formula 7 the phrase eventually is used as shorthand for the fact that there exists formula 5 such that for all formula 6 so the convergence definition can be restated as for all formula 4 eventually formula 7 the set of integers that do not satisfy the property is a finite set that is the set is empty or has a maximum element in this setting it is also synonymous with the expression for all but a finite number of terms a special case

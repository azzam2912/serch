this conjecture was first stated by and states that if g denotes the minimum number of vertices in a dominating set for g then a 4 cycle c has domination number two any single vertex only dominates itself and its two neighbors but any pair of vertices dominates the whole graph the product formula 2 is a four dimensional hypercube graph it has 16 vertices and any single vertex can only dominate itself and four neighbors so three vertices could only dominate 15 of the 16 vertices therefore at least four vertices are required to dominate the entire graph the bound given by vizing s conjecture it is possible for the domination number of a product to be much larger than the bound given by vizing s conjecture for instance for a star k its domination number k is one it is possible to dominate the entire star with a single vertex at its hub therefore for the graph formula 3 formed as the product of two stars vizing s conjecture states only that the domination number should be at least 1 1 1 however the domination number of this graph is actually much higher it has n 2 n

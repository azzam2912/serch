it occurs in the definitions of the kelvin and the gas constant and in planck s law of black body radiation and boltzmann s entropy formula the boltzmann constant has the dimension energy divided by temperature the same as entropy as part of the 2019 redefinition of si base units the boltzmann constant is one of the seven defining constants that have been given exact definitions they are used in various combinations to define the seven si base units the boltzmann constant is defined to be exactly this definition allows the kelvin to be defined in terms of the boltzmann constant the metre the second and the kilogram before 2019 its value in si units was a measured quantity measurements of the boltzmann constant depended on the definition of the kelvin in terms of the triple point of water the measured values were used to determine the quantity that is used in the 2019 definition to make the definition s value for the kelvin identical to the old value to within the limits of experimental accuracy at the time of the definition the boltzmann constant is a scaling factor between macroscopic thermodynamic temperature and microscopic thermal energy physics macroscopically the

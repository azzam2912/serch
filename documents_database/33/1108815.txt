its catalytic domain is closely related to those of several other kinases including mouse mekk2 tobacco npk and yeast ste11 northern blot analysis revealed a 4 6 kb transcript that appears to be ubiquitously expressed map3ks are involved in regulating cell fate in response to external stimuli map3k3 directly regulates the stress activated protein kinase sapk and extracellular signal regulated protein kinase erk pathways by activating sek and mek1 2 respectively in cotransfection assays it enhanced transcription from a nuclear factor kappa b nf b dependent reporter gene consistent with a role in the sapk pathway alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed mekk3 regulates the p38 jnk and erk1 2 pathways map3k3 has been shown to interact with sqstm1 p62 two snps in the map3k3 gene were found as candidates for association with colon and rectal cancers mekk3 is highly expressed in 4 ovarian cancer cell lines ovca429 hey dov13 and skov3 this expression level is significantly higher in those cancer cells when compared to normal cells mekk3 expression levels are comparable to ikk kinase activities which also relate to activation of nf b high expression of mekk3 in most of these ovarian cancer cells supposedly

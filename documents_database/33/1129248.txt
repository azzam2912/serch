the hnrnps are rna binding proteins and they complex with heterogeneous nuclear rna hnrna these proteins are associated with pre mrnas in the nucleus and appear to influence pre mrna processing reference koenig j nature structural and molecular biology 2010 iclip and other aspects of mrna metabolism and transport while all of the hnrnps are present in the nucleus some seem to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm the hnrnp proteins have distinct nucleic acid binding properties transcriptional regulation by hormonal 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin d 3 calcitriol involves occupancy of vitamin d response elements vdres by hnrnpc or 1 25 oh 2 d 3 bound vitamin d receptor vdr this relationship is disrupted by elevated hnrnpc causing a form of hereditary vitamin d resistant rickets hvdrr in both humans and non human primates the protein encoded by this gene can act as a tetramer and is involved in the assembly of 40s hnrnp particles species specific tetramerization of hnrnpc subunits is important to its nucleic acid binding whereby over expression of major human hnrnpc subunits in mouse osteoblastic cells confers vitamin d resistance multiple transcript variants encoding at least two different isoforms have been described for this gene hnrnpc

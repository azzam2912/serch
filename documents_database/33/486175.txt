the simplest example is diacetylene or butadiyne h c c c c h these compounds have also been called oligoynes or carbinoids after carbyne the hypothetical allotrope of carbon that would be the ultimate member of the series the synthesis of this substance has been claimed several times since the 1960s but those reports have been disputed indeed the substances identified as short chains of carbyne in many early organic synthesis attempts would be called polyynes today polyynes are distinct from polyacetylenes polymers formally obtained by polymerization of acetylenes the backbones of polyacetylenes have alternating single and double bonds in biochemistry and plant biology polyacetylene is routinely used to describe naturally occurring polyynes and related species along with cumulenes polyynes are distinguished from other organic chains by their rigidity which makes them promising for molecular nanotechnology polyynes have been detected in interstellar molecular clouds where hydrogen is scarce the first reported synthesis of a polyyne was performed in 1869 by carl glaser who observed that copper phenylacetylide cucch undergoes oxidative dimerization in the presence of air to produce diphenylbutadiyne chcch interest in these compounds has stimulated research into their preparation by organic synthesis by several general routes as a main

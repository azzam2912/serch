then it is possible to invert or solve the equation for w expressing it in the form formula 2 given by a power series where the theorem further states that this series has a non zero radius of convergence i e formula 5 represents an analytic function of z in a neighbourhood of formula 6 this is also called reversion of series if the assertions about analyticity are omitted the formula is also valid for formal power series and can be generalized in various ways it can be formulated for functions of several variables it can be extended to provide a ready formula for f g z for any analytic function f and it can be generalized to the case f a 0 where the inverse g is a multivalued function the theorem was proved by lagrange and generalized by hans heinrich b rmann both in the late 18th century there is a straightforward derivation using complex analysis and contour integration the complex formal power series version is a consequence of knowing the formula for polynomials so the theory of analytic functions may be applied actually the machinery from analytic function theory enters only in a formal way in this

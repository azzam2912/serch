selmer a french manufacturer produced the instrument from 1932 to about 1952 in 1932 selmer partnered with the italian guitarist and luthier mario maccaferri to produce a line of acoustic guitars based on maccaferri s unorthodox design although maccaferri s association with selmer ended in 1934 the company continued to make several models of this guitar until 1952 the guitar was closely associated with jazz guitarist django reinhardt in its archetypal steel string jazz orchestre form the selmer is distinguished by a fairly large body with squarish bouts and either a d shaped or longitudinal oval sound hole the strings pass over a movable bridge and are gathered at the tail as on a mandolin two mustache markers are fixed to the soundboard to help position the movable bridge the top of the guitar is gently arched or domed a feature achieved by bending a flat piece of wood rather than by the violin style carving used in archtop guitars the top is also rather thin at about it has a comparatively wide fretboard about at the nut and a snake shaped slotted headstock the back and top are both ladder braced which was the norm for french and italian

cathelicidins serve a critical role in mammalian innate immune defense against invasive bacterial infection the cathelicidin family of peptides are classified as antimicrobial peptides amps the amp family also includes the defensins whilst the defensins share common structural features cathelicidin related peptides are highly heterogeneous in humans its precursor is encoded by the gene camp which is cleaved into the active form ll 37 members of the cathelicidin family of antimicrobial polypeptides are characterized by a highly conserved region cathelin domain and a highly variable cathelicidin peptide domain cathelicidin peptides have been isolated from many different species of mammals cathelicidins were originally found in neutrophils but have since been found in many other cells including epithelial cells and macrophages after activation by bacteria viruses fungi or the hormone 1 25 d which is the hormonally active form of vitamin d the general rule of the mechanism triggering cathelicidin action like that of other antimicrobial peptides involves the disintegration damaging and puncturing of cell membranes of organisms toward which the peptide is active cathelicidin rapidly destroys the lipoprotein membranes of microbes enveloped in phagosomes after fusion with lysosomes in macrophages cathelicidins range in size from 12 to 80 amino acid residues

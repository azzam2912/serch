the crux of this theory is that hierarchical structure in natural language maps universally onto a particular surface linearization namely specifier head complement branching order to understand what is meant by hierarchical structure consider the sentence the king of england likes apples we can replace this by he likes apples since the phrase the king of england can be replaced by a pronoun we say that it constitutes a hierarchical unit called a constituent further constituency tests reveal the phrase likes apples to be a constituent hierarchical units are built up according to the principles of phrase structure into a branching tree formation rather than into a linear order older theories of linearization posited various algorithms for translating the hierarchical structure into a linear order however antisymmetry holds that linear order falls out from the hierarchical relationships among the constituents in this particular case there is a relation of asymmetric c command between the constituent the king of england and likes apples therefore the first constituent is ordered linearly before the second further tests ultimately give rise to linear order for the internal parts of these constituents the theory of the antisymmetry of syntax has a twofold aims on the

some cells in some multicellular organisms may however lack them for example mature mammalian red blood cells a number of unicellular organisms such as microsporidia parabasalids and diplomonads have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures to date only one eukaryote monocercomonoides is known to have completely lost its mitochondria the word mitochondrion comes from the greek thread and granule or grain like mitochondria generate most of the cell s supply of adenosine triphosphate atp used as a source of chemical energy a mitochondrion is thus termed the powerhouse of the cell mitochondria are commonly between 0 75 and 3 m in area but vary considerably in size and structure unless specifically stained they are not visible in addition to supplying cellular energy mitochondria are involved in other tasks such as signaling cellular differentiation and cell death as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases including mitochondrial disorders cardiac dysfunction heart failure and autism the number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism tissue and cell type for instance red blood cells

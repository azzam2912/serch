branched polymers have more compact and symmetrical molecular conformations and exhibit intra heterogeneous dynamical behavior with respect to the unbranched polymers in crosslinking rubber by vulcanization short sulfur branches link polyisoprene chains or a synthetic variant into a multiply branched thermosetting elastomer rubber can also be so completely vulcanized that it becomes a rigid solid so hard it can be used as the bit in a smoking pipe polycarbonate chains can be crosslinked to form the hardest most impact resistant thermosetting plastic used in safety glasses branching may result from the formation of carbon carbon or various other types of covalent bonds branching by ester and amide bonds is typically by a condensation reaction producing one molecule of water or hcl for each bond formed polymers which are branched but not crosslinked are generally thermoplastic branching sometimes occurs spontaneously during synthesis of polymers e g by free radical polymerization of ethylene to form polyethylene in fact preventing branching to produce linear polyethylene requires special methods because of the way polyamides are formed nylon would seem to be limited to unbranched straight chains but star branched nylon can be produced by the condensation of dicarboxylic acids with polyamines having three or

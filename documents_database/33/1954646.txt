in general an intersection curve consists of the common points of two transversally intersecting surfaces meaning that at any common point the surface normals are not parallel this restriction excludes cases where the surfaces are touching or have surface parts in common the analytic determination of the intersection curve of two surfaces is easy only in simple cases for example a the intersection of two planes b plane section of a quadric sphere cylinder cone etc c intersection of two quadrics in special cases for the general case literature provides algorithms in order to calculate points of the intersection curve of two surfaces given two planes formula 1 linearly independent i e the planes are not parallel wanted a parametric representation formula 2 of the intersection line the direction of the line one gets from the crossproduct of the normal vectors formula 3 a point formula 4 of the intersection line can be determined by intersecting the given planes formula 5 with the plane formula 6 which is perpendicular to formula 7 and formula 8 inserting the parametric representation of formula 9 into the equations of formula 10 und formula 11 yields the parameters formula 12 and formula 13 formula

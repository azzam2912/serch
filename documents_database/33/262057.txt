a partial and refined case of this conjecture for elliptic curves over rationals is called the taniyama shimura conjecture or the modularity theorem whose statement he subsequently refined in collaboration with goro shimura the names taniyama shimura and weil have all been attached to this conjecture but the idea is essentially due to taniyama taniyama s interests were in algebraic number theory and his fame is mainly due to two problems posed by him at the symposium on algebraic number theory held in tokyo and nikko in 1955 his meeting with andr weil at this symposium was to have a major influence on taniyama s work these problems form the basis of a conjecture every elliptic curve defined over the rational field is a factor of the jacobian of a modular function field this conjecture proved to be a major factor in the proof of fermat s last theorem by andrew wiles in 1986 ken ribet proved that if the taniyama shimura conjecture held then so would fermat s last theorem which inspired andrew wiles to work for a number of years in secrecy on it and to prove enough of it to prove fermat s last theorem owing to

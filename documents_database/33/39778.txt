they are typically composed of thousands of atoms or more the most common macromolecules in biochemistry are biopolymers nucleic acids proteins and carbohydrates and large non polymeric molecules such as lipids and macrocycles synthetic macromolecules include common plastics and synthetic fibers as well as experimental materials such as carbon nanotubes the term macromolecule macro molecule was coined by nobel laureate hermann staudinger in the 1920s although his first relevant publication on this field only mentions high molecular compounds in excess of 1 000 atoms at that time the term polymer as introduced by berzelius in 1832 had a different meaning from that of today it simply was another form of isomerism for example with benzene and acetylene and had little to do with size usage of the term to describe large molecules varies among the disciplines for example while biology refers to macromolecules as the four large molecules comprising living things in chemistry the term may refer to aggregates of two or more molecules held together by intermolecular forces rather than covalent bonds but which do not readily dissociate according to the standard iupac definition the term macromolecule as used in polymer science refers only to a single molecule for

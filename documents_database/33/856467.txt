key goals of mcc studies include the derivation of molecular and cellular explanations of cognitive processes as well as finding mechanisms and treatments for cognitive disorders although closely connected with behavioral genetics mcc emphasizes the integration of molecular and cellular explanations of behavior instead of focusing on the connections between genes and behavior unlike cognitive neuroscience which historically has focused on the connection between human brain systems and behavior the field of mcc has used model organisms such as mice to study how molecular i e receptor kinase activation phosphatase regulation intra cellular i e dendritic processes and inter cellular processes i e synaptic plasticity network representations such as place fields modulate cognitive function methods employed in mcc include but are not limited to transgenic organisms i e mice viral vectors pharmacology in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology optogenetics in vivo imaging and behavioral analysis modeling is becoming an essential component of the field because of the complexity of the multilevel data generated the field of mcc has its roots in the pioneering pharmacological studies of the role of nmda receptor in long term potentiation and spatial learning and in studies that used knockout mice to look at the role

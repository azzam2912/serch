similar to optical interferometers atom interferometers measure the difference in phase between atomic matter waves along different paths atom interferometers have many uses in fundamental physics including measurements of the gravitational constant the fine structure constant the universality of free fall and have been proposed as a method to detect gravitational waves they also have applied uses as accelerometers rotation sensors and gravity gradiometers interferometry inherently depends on the wave nature of the object as pointed out by de broglie in his phd thesis particles including atoms can behave like waves the so called wave particle duality according to the general framework of quantum mechanics more and more high precision experiments now employ atom interferometers due to their short de broglie wavelength some experiments are now even using molecules to obtain even shorter de broglie wavelengths and to search for the limits of quantum mechanics in many experiments with atoms the roles of matter and light are reversed compared to the laser based interferometers i e the beam splitter and mirrors are lasers while the source instead emits matter waves the atoms while the use of atoms offers easy access to higher frequencies and thus accuracies than light atoms are

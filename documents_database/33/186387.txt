luciferins typically undergo an enzyme catalysed oxidation and the resulting excited state intermediate emits light upon decaying to its ground state this may refer to molecules that are substrates for both luciferases and photoproteins luciferins are a class of small molecule substrates that are oxidized in the presence of a luciferase an enzyme to produce energy in the form of light it is not known just how many types of luciferins there are but some of the better studied compounds are listed below because of the chemical diversity of luciferins there is no clear unifying mechanism of action except that all require molecular oxygen at some step based on the variety of luciferins and luciferases their diverse reaction mechanisms and scattered phylogenetic distribution it is estimated that many of them have arisen independently in the course of evolution firefly luciferin is the luciferin found in many lampyridae species it is the substrate of beetle luciferases ec 1 13 12 7 responsible for the characteristic yellow light emission from fireflies though can cross react to produce light with related enzymes from non luminous species the chemistry is unusual as adenosine triphosphate atp is required for light emission in addition to molecular

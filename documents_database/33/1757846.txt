the raji cell line is widely used as a transfection host raji cells were derived from the b lymphocytes of an 11 year old nigerian burkitt s lymphoma male patient in 1963 by r j v pulvertaft the raji cell line is categorized as lymphoblast like the culture medium used to grow raji cells is rpmi supplemented with serum some characteristics of raji cells include a lack of differentiation illustrated by the formation of large aggregations of hundreds of individual cells the cells are relatively large in diameter 5 8 m have irregular indented nuclei and almost extensive cytoplasm with free ribosomes which tend to clump raji cells grow as single non motile free floating non adhesion individuals or doublets to glass some cells look elongated pear shaped with larger multinucleate round cells the raji cell line produces an unusual strain of epstein barr virus which both transforms cord blood lymphocytes and induces early antigens in the cells translocations between chromosomes 8 and 22 have occurred in all three variations of the raji cell line but some cells synthesize immunoglobulin m with light chains of the kappa type in contrast to the usual concordance between a translocation involving chromosome 22

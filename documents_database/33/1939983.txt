it may be initiated in response to a variety of cues including infection traumatic brain injury toxic metabolites or autoimmunity in the central nervous system cns including the brain and spinal cord microglia are the resident innate immune cells that are activated in response to these cues the cns is typically an immunologically privileged site because peripheral immune cells are generally blocked by the blood brain barrier bbb a specialized structure composed of astrocytes and endothelial cells however circulating peripheral immune cells may surpass a compromised bbb and encounter neurons and glial cells expressing major histocompatibility complex molecules perpetuating the immune response although the response is initiated to protect the central nervous system from the infectious agent the effect may be toxic and widespread inflammation as well as further migration of leukocytes through the blood brain barrier neuroinflammation is widely regarded as chronic as opposed to acute inflammation of the central nervous system acute inflammation usually follows injury to the central nervous system immediately and is characterized by inflammatory molecules endothelial cell activation platelet deposition and tissue edema chronic inflammation is the sustained activation of glial cells and recruitment of other immune cells into the brain it is chronic inflammation

the system is a visual double star whose components are designated tauri and tauri with the latter being the more northerly star the two are separated by 7 2 arcminutes on the sky and can be readily split with a pair of binoculars they have apparent visual magnitudes of 5 07 and 4 70 respectively which indicated they are both visible to the naked eye based upon parallax measurements tauri is about 147 light years from the sun while tauri is 156 light years distant tauri is a single lined spectroscopic binary star system with an orbital period of 38 951 days and an eccentricity of 0 15 the visible component is an am star with a stellar classification of a4m indicating it is chemically peculiar a type star it is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 56 5 km s the star has 1 9 times the mass of the sun and is radiating 14 7 times the sun s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 8 470 k although it lies in the general direction of the hyades cluster based on parallax measurements it has been excluded from the list of candidate members tauri

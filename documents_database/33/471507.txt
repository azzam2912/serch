air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge making the ice appear blue small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless in glaciers the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out increasing the density of the created ice large quantities of water appear to be blue as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue a large piece of compressed ice or a glacier similarly appears blue the blue color is sometimes wrongly attributed to rayleigh scattering which is responsible for the color of the sky rather water ice is blue for the same reason that large quantities of liquid water are blue it is a result of an overtone of an oxygen hydrogen o h bond stretch in water which absorbs light at the red end of the visible spectrum in the case of oceans or lakes some of the light hitting the surface of water is reflected back directly but most of it penetrates the surface interacting with its molecules the water molecule can vibrate in different modes when light hits it the red orange yellow and

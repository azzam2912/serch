the similarity matrix is provided as an input and consists of a quantitative assessment of the relative similarity of each pair of points in the dataset in application to image segmentation spectral clustering is known as segmentation based object categorization given an enumerated set of data points the similarity matrix may be defined as a symmetric matrix formula 1 where formula 2 represents a measure of the similarity between data points with indices formula 3 and formula 4 the general approach to spectral clustering is to use a standard clustering method there are many such methods k means is discussed below on relevant eigenvectors of a laplacian matrix of formula 1 there are many different ways to define a laplacian which have different mathematical interpretations and so the clustering will also have different interpretations the eigenvectors that are relevant are the ones that correspond to smallest several eigenvalues of the laplacian except for the smallest eigenvalue which will have a value of 0 for computational efficiency these eigenvectors are often computed as the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest several eigenvalues of a function of the laplacian spectral clustering is well known to relate to partitioning of a mass spring system

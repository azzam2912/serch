the advantages of septic are the specificity and speed needs only a few minutes offered by the characteristics of phage infection the sensitivity due to fluctuation enhanced sensing and durability originating from the robustness of phages an idealistic septic device may be as small as a pen and maybe able to identify a library of different bacteria within a few minutes measurement window septic utilizes bacteriophages as indicators to trigger an ionic response by the bacteria during phage infection microscopic metal electrodes detect the random fluctuations of the electrochemical potential due to the stochastic fluctuations of the ionic concentration gradient caused by the phage infection of bacteria the electrode pair in the electrolyte with different local ion concentrations at the vicinity of electrodes form an electrochemical cell that produces a voltage depending on the instantaneous ratio of local concentrations while the concentrations are fluctuating an alternating random voltage difference will appear between the electrodes according to the experimental studies whenever there is an ongoing phage infection the power density spectrum of the measured electronic noise will have a noise spectrum while without phage infection it is a 1 f noise spectrum in order to have a high sensitivity a dc

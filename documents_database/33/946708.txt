it is a colourless hygroscopic solid that dissolves well in many polar solvents its properties are similar to those of aluminium chloride due to beryllium s diagonal relationship with aluminium beryllium chloride is prepared by reaction of the metal with chlorine at high temperatures becl can also be prepared by carbothermal reduction of beryllium oxide in the presence of chlorine becl can be prepared by treating beryllium with hydrogen chloride the solid is a 1 dimensional polymer consisting of edge shared tetrahedra in contrast bef is a 3 dimensional polymer with a structure akin to that of quartz in the gas phase becl exists both as a linear monomer and a bridged dimer with two bridging chlorine atoms where the beryllium atom is 3 coordinate the linear shape of the monomeric form is as predicted by vsepr theory the linear shape contrasts with the monomeric forms of some of the dihalides of the heavier members of group 2 e g caf srf baf srcl bacl babr and bai which are all non linear beryllium chloride is stable in dry air beryllium chloride is a lewis acid and has been used as a catalyst in some organic reactions it hydrolyzes evolving

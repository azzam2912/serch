since then it has been observed for in several different types of interstellar environments observations that have several different scientific uses it gives astronomers information about the fractional ionization of gas clouds the chemistry that happens within those clouds and it is often used as a tracer for molecules that are not as easily detected such as n its 1 0 rotational transition occurs at 93 174 ghz a region of the spectrum where earth s atmosphere is transparent and it has a significant optical depth in both cold and warm clouds so it is relatively easy to observe with ground based observatories the results of nh observations can be used not only for determining the chemistry of interstellar clouds but also for mapping the density and velocity profiles of these clouds nh was first observed in 1974 by b e turner he observed a previously unidentified triplet at 93 174 ghz using the nrao 11 m telescope immediately after this initial observation green et al identified the triplet as the 1 0 rotational transition of nh this was done using a combination of ab initio molecular calculations and comparison of similar molecules such as n co hcn hnc and

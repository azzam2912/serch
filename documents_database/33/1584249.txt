it makes use of techniques from rock magnetism and magnetic mineralogy the magnetic properties of minerals are used as proxies for environmental change in applications such as paleoclimate paleoceanography studies of the provenance of sediments pollution and archeology the main advantages of using magnetic measurements are that magnetic minerals are almost ubiquitous and magnetic measurements are quick and non invasive environmental magnetism was first identified as a distinct field in 1978 and was introduced to a wider audience by the book environmental magnetism in 1986 since then it has grown rapidly finding application in and making major contributions to a range of diverse fields especially paleoclimate sedimentology paleoceanography and studies of particulate pollution environmental magnetism is built on two parts of rock magnetism magnetic mineralogy which looks at how basic magnetic properties depend on composition and magnetic hysteresis which can provide details on particle size and other physical properties that also affect the hysteresis several parameters such as magnetic susceptibility and various kinds of remanence have been developed to represent certain features of the hysteresis these parameters are then used to estimate mineral size and composition the main contributors to the magnetic properties of rocks are the iron oxides including

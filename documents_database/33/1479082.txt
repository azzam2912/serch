this area of study has turned up unexpected instances of wilf equivalence where two seemingly unrelated permutation classes have the same numbers of permutations of each length there are two symmetry classes and a single wilf class for single permutations of length three there are seven symmetry classes and three wilf classes for single permutations of length four no non recursive formula counting 1324 avoiding permutations is known a recursive formula was given by a more efficient algorithm using functional equations was given by which was enhanced by and then further enhanced by who give the first 50 terms of the enumeration there are five symmetry classes and three wilf classes all of which were enumerated in there are eighteen symmetry classes and nine wilf classes all of which have been enumerated for these results see or there are 56 symmetry classes and 38 wilf equivalence classes only 3 of these remain unenumerated and their generating functions are conjectured not to satisfy any algebraic differential equation ade by in particular their conjecture would imply that these generating functions are not d finite the database of permutation pattern avoidance maintained by bridget tenner contains details of the enumeration of many other

that is the n shapes can be assembled in n different ways so as to create larger copies of themselves where the increase in scale is the same in each case figure 1 shows an example for n 4 using distinctly shaped decominoes the concept can be extended to include pieces of higher dimension the name setisets was coined by lee sallows in 2012 but the problem of finding such sets for n 4 was asked decades previously by c dudley langford and examples for polyaboloes discovered by martin gardner wade e philpott and others and polyominoes discovered by maurice j povah were previously published by gardner from the above definition it follows that a setiset composed of n identical pieces is the same thing as a self replicating tile or rep tile of which setisets are therefore a generalization setisets using n distinct shapes such as figure 1 are called perfect figure 2 shows an example for n 4 which is imperfect because two of the component shapes are the same the shapes employed in a setiset need not be connected regions disjoint pieces composed of two or more separated islands are also permitted such pieces are described as

it uses integral images to extract features such as local sums histograms and haar like features from multiple registered image channels this method was highly exploited by doll r et al in their work for pedestrian detection that was first described at the bmvc in 2009 typically a channel refers to a certain component that defines pixel values in a digital image a color image for example is an aggregate of three channels red green and blue the color data of an image is stored in three arrays of values known as channels while this definition of a channel is widely accepted across various domains there exists a broader definition in computer vision which allows one to exploit other features of an image besides the color information one such definition refers to a channel as a registered map of the original image where the output pixels are mapped to input pixels by some linear or non transformation according to this notion of a channel color channels of an image can be redefined as output images that are obtained by extracting one specific color information point from the input image at a time similarly a channel for a grayscale input image

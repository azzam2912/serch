an error in one component may then be out voted by the other two in a triply redundant system the system has three sub components all three of which must fail before the system fails since each one rarely fails and the sub components are expected to fail independently the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small often outweighed by other risk factors such as human error redundancy may also be known by the terms majority voting systems or voting logic redundancy sometimes produces less instead of greater reliability it creates a more complex system which is prone to various issues it may lead to human neglect of duty and may lead to higher production demands which by overstressing the system may make it less safe in computer science there are four major forms of redundancy these are a modified form of software redundancy applied to hardware may be structures are usually designed with redundant parts as well ensuring that if one part fails the entire structure will not collapse a structure without redundancy is called fracture critical meaning that a single broken component can cause the collapse of the entire structure bridges that failed due

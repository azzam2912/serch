the experiment sought to provide flight data to help lockheed martin validate and tune the computational predictive tools used to determine the aerodynamic performance of the lockheed martin x 33 lifting body and linear aerospike engine combination and to lay groundwork for a future reusable launch vehicle lasre was a small half span model of the x 33 s lifting body with eight thrust cells of an aerospike engine rotated 90 degrees and mounted on the back of a lockheed sr 71 blackbird aircraft to operate like a kind of flying wind tunnel the experiment focused on determining how a reusable launch vehicle s engine plume would affect the aerodynamics of its lifting body shape at specific altitudes and speeds reaching about 750 miles hour 335 meter second or 1207 km h design refinements looked to minimize the interaction of the aerodynamic flow with the engine plume which could create drag the aircraft completed seven research flights two initial flights were used to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the lasre apparatus on the back of the aircraft the first of those occurred 31 october 1997 the sr 71 took off at 8 31 a m pacific standard time pst the

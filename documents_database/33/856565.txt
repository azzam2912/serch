it was formed in 2001 by american scientists in the us the project is funded by the national human genome research institute a division of the national institutes of health nih the united states department of agriculture usda the texas agricultural experiment station the university of illinois sociogenomics initiative and various beekeepers association and the bee industry first scientific findings show that the honey bee genome may have evolved more slowly than the genomes of the fruit fly and malaria mosquito the bee genome contains versions of some important mammalian genes the complete genome of apis mellifera has been sequenced and consists of 10 000 genes with approximately 236 million base pairs the size of the genome is a tenth of the human genome the western honey bee gene sequence showed 163 chemical receptors for smell but only 10 for taste besides the discovery of new genes for the use of pollen and nectar researchers found that in comparison with other insects apis mellifera has fewer genes for immunity detoxification and the development of the cuticula the population genetic analysis showed africa as the origin and hypothesized that the spread into europe happened in at least two independent waves data

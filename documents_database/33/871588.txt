the sandstone fronted historicist 1901 building by cremer wolffenstein was badly damaged in 1919 during the spartacist uprising held by the insurrectionists it was laid under siege by government troops in 1921 on the strength of his einstein tower mendelsohn was hired to add extra storeys and a new entrance to the building the new frontage made prominent use of aluminum and modern typography and the new upper floors were made from ferro concrete the experimental nature of the structure led to a disaster during construction in 1923 when one of the slabs of the new extension fell into the newspaper offices which were still in use killing 14 people the use of strips and sculpted elements in the fenestration gave it a dynamic futuristic form emphasised by the contrast with the wilhelmine style below it was perhaps the first example of a streamlined building and hence a great influence on streamline moderne the effect on american architecture is perhaps unsurprising as mendelsohn s partner on the mossehaus and the designer of the interiors was richard neutra the building was very close to the berlin wall so it became dilapidated after world war ii though mossehaus was at one time

it was named after the two german scientists max born and fritz haber who developed it in 1919 it was also independently formulated by kasimir fajans the cycle is concerned with the formation of an ionic compound from the reaction of a metal often a group i or group ii element with a halogen or other non metallic element such as oxygen born haber cycles are used primarily as a means of calculating lattice energy or more precisely enthalpy which cannot otherwise be measured directly the lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change involved in the formation of an ionic compound from gaseous ions an exothermic process or sometimes defined as the energy to break the ionic compound into gaseous ions an endothermic process a born haber cycle applies hess s law to calculate the lattice enthalpy by comparing the standard enthalpy change of formation of the ionic compound from the elements to the enthalpy required to make gaseous ions from the elements this latter calculation is complex to make gaseous ions from elements it is necessary to atomise the elements turn each into gaseous atoms and then to ionise the atoms if the element is normally a molecule then we

the pdh technique has a broad range of applications including interferometric gravitational wave detectors atomic physics and time measurement standards many of which also use related techniques such as frequency modulation spectroscopy named after r v pound ronald drever and john l hall the pdh technique was described in 1983 by drever hall and others working at the university of glasgow and the u s national bureau of standards this optical technique has many similarities to an older frequency modulation technique developed by pound for microwave cavities since a wide range of conditions contribute to determine the linewidth produced by a laser the pdh technique provides a means to control and decrease the laser s linewidth provided an optical cavity that is more stable than the laser source alternatively if a stable laser is available the pdh technique can be used to stabilize and or measure the instabilities in an optical cavity length the pdh technique responds to the frequency of laser emission independently of intensity which is significant because many other methods that control laser frequency such as a side of fringe lock are also affected by intensity instabilities in recent years the pound drever hall technique has become

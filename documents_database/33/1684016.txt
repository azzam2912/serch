according to its proponents freud in his later writings had already distinguished between construction and interpretation hence construction reconstruction is being a kind of upgrade of interpretation there is a strong difference between simple interpretation and construction concerning how to see the past in the interpretations the past is discovered as a preexisting phenomenon while in the construction the past is not just simply found but it is also created in the therapeutic setting a simple interpretation of the patient s claims is usually leading to a counterproductive debate about who is more correct the patient or the analyst the construction is attended to overcome this debate by using only the patient s material without the invasions from the analyst s side a resemblance to methods of malan and davanloo the patient unable to avoid the truth the situation that his her truth is discovered is either producing a confession hence validating the construction or producing further fantasies and associations a professionally led construction is inescapable as it does not use persuasion paradoxical intentions etc elements of construction are traceable e g in the intensive short term dynamic psychotherapy in the reid s interrogation technique or in diplomatic political discourses

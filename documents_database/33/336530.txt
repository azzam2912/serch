an important example is frequency weighting in sound level measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as a b c and d weighting as defined in iec 61672 are used unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels the four curves are applied to the measured sound level for example by the use of a weighting filter in a sound level meter to arrive at readings of loudness in phons or in decibels db above the threshold of hearing see a weighting although a weighting with a slow rms detector as commonly used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits a different weighting curve itu r 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a quasi peak detector this method formerly known as ccir weighting is preferred by the telecommunications industry broadcasters and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow band circuits

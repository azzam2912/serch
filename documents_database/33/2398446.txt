it is located at a distance of circa 120 million light years from earth which given its apparent dimensions means that ngc 4939 is about 190 000 light years across it was discovered by william herschel on march 25 1786 ngc 4939 has been characterised as a seyfert galaxy a galaxy category which features bright point like nuclei ngc 4939 is a type ii seyfert galaxy its x ray spectrum is more consistent with a compton thick cold reflection source which means that the source is hidden behind dense material mainly gas and dust and the x ray observed have been reflected but a compton thin transmission model could not be ruled out the equivalent width of the fek line is large indicating too that it is a compton thick source further observations by swift observatory confirmed its compton thick nature the source of activity in the active galactic nuclei is a supermassive black hole smbh lying at the centre of the galaxy the smbh at the centre of ngc 4939 is accreting material with a rate of 0 077 per year the black hole has been detected in hard x rays which are not absorbed by the compton thick

an inflatable surface float with a radio transmitter remains on the surface for communication with the aircraft while one or more hydrophone sensors and stabilizing equipment descend below the surface to a selected depth that is variable depending on environmental conditions and the search pattern the buoy relays acoustic information from its hydrophone s via uhf vhf radio to operators on board the aircraft with the technological improvement of the submarine in modern warfare the need for an effective tracking system was born sound navigation and ranging sonar was originally developed by the british who called it asdic in the waning days of world war i at the time the only way to detect submarines was by listening for them passive sonar or visually by chance when they were on the surface recharging their battery banks air patrols the british mostly used small airships which had the advantage of long endurance could spot surfaced submarines and occasionally when conditions were right even submerged ones as the diving depth of submarines of the era was so limited if contact was made they would follow the submarine while summoning surface ships by radio to attack it sonar saw extremely limited use and

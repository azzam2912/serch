it has been estimated that pdac causes 34000 deaths per year in the eu alone despite considerable research efforts in the past decades conventional treatment approaches including surgery radiation chemotherapy and combinations of these have close to no impact on the course of this aggressive neoplasm therefore virtually all of the patients diagnosed with pc develop metastases and die given this scenario the search for new drugs to combat pdac progression and thus increase patient life expectancy and quality of life has been given high priority in particular the national cancer institute s gastrointestinal cancer steering committee has recently place major emphasis on the enhancement of research to identify and validate the relevant targets and molecular pathways in pdac cancer stem cells and the microenvironment the work proposed in this program meets the need to reverse translate the clinical issues encountered in pdac into tailored researches to overcome such problems particularly resistance to conventional therapeutics and high propensity to metastasize were taken into account when choosing for this project therapeutics that act through novel modes of action and molecular targets that are emerging as crucially involved in metastasis our consortium will produce numerous new molecules to be tested and validated

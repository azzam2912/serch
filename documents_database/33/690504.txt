the modeling of the fabrication is termed process tcad while the modeling of the device operation is termed device tcad included are the modelling of process steps such as diffusion and ion implantation and modelling of the behavior of the electrical devices based on fundamental physics such as the doping profiles of the devices tcad may also include the creation of compact models such as the well known spice transistor models which try to capture the electrical behavior of such devices but do not generally derive them from the underlying physics however the spice simulator itself is usually considered as part of ecad rather than tcad from the diagram on the right technology files and design rules are essential building blocks of the integrated circuit design process their accuracy and robustness over process technology its variability and the operating conditions of the ic environmental parasitic interactions and testing including adverse conditions such as electro static discharge are critical in determining performance yield and reliability development of these technology and design rule files involves an iterative process that crosses boundaries of technology and device development product design and quality assurance modeling and simulation play a critical role in support of many

enzymes from this superfamily are ubiquitous in organisms from e coli to humans and catalyze a phosphoryl transfer reaction on a phosphosugar substrate four well studied subgroups in the superfamily are other enzymes in the superfamily are known to act as glucose 1 6 bisphoshpate synthases and phosphopentomutases a number of proteins in the superfamily have been characterized functionally and structurally this table illustrates different members of the superfamily the enzymes in the superfamily typically catalyze the reversible conversion of 1 phosphosugars to 6 phosphosugars the reaction proceeds via a bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate the active form of the enzyme is phosphorylated at a conserved serine residue in the active site and also requires a bound metal ion typically mg2 for full activity the initial phosphoryl transfer takes place from the phosphoserine to the substrate creating a bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate this is followed by a second phosphoryl transfer from the substrate back to enzyme producing product and regenerating the active form of the enzyme structures of multiple enzymes have been determined through x ray crystallography in general they share a very similar topology with a heart shape and four domains see image below most enzymes appear to be monomers however some

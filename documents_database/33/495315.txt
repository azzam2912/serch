the baseline apparent magnitude of the pair is 5 17 which according to the bortle dark sky scale is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye from suburban skies because of the earth s orbit about the sun this system has an annual parallax shift of 4 18 mas this provides a distance estimate of approximately sigma aquilae is a double lined spectroscopic binary system consisting of two massive b type main sequence stars each has a stellar classification of b3 v they are detached components which means the two stars are sufficiently distant from each other that neither fills its roche lobe because the orbital plane lies close to the line of sight with the earth they form a beta lyrae type eclipsing binary variable star system the brightness of the pair decreases during each eclipse which occurs with a frequency determined by their orbital period of 1 95026 days during the eclipse of the primary component the net magnitude decreases by 0 20 the eclipse of the secondary component results in a magnitude decrease of 0 10

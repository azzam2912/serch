it is usually applied to gases a monatomic gas is one in which atoms are not bound to each other all chemical elements will be monatomic in the gas phase at sufficient high temperatures the thermodynamic behavior of monatomic gas is extremely simple when compared to polyatomic gases because it is free of any rotational or vibrational energy the energy of a single monoatomic gas formula 1 the energy of one mole monoatomic gas formula 2 one mole atom contains the avogadro number formula 3 of atoms the only chemical elements that are stable single atom molecules at standard temperature and pressure stp are the noble gases these are helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon noble gases have a full outer valence shell making them rather non reactive species while these elements have been described historically as completely inert chemical compounds have been synthesized with all but neon and helium when grouped together with the homonuclear diatomic gases such as nitrogen n the noble gases are called elemental gases or molecular gases to distinguish them from molecules that are also chemical compounds the motion of a monatomic gas is translation electronic excitation is not important at room temperature thus

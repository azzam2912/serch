human serum albumin is encoded by the alb gene other mammalian forms such as bovine serum albumin are chemically similar serum albumin is produced by the liver occurs dissolved in blood plasma and is the most abundant blood protein in mammals albumin is essential for maintaining the oncotic pressure needed for proper distribution of body fluids between blood vessels and body tissues without albumin the high pressure in the blood vessels would force more fluids out into the tissues it also acts as a plasma carrier by non specifically binding several hydrophobic steroid hormones and as a transport protein for hemin and fatty acids too much or too little circulating serum albumin may be harmful albumin in the urine usually denotes the presence of kidney disease occasionally albumin appears in the urine of normal persons following long periods of standing postural albuminuria albumin functions primarily as a carrier protein for steroids fatty acids and thyroid hormones in the blood and plays a major role in stabilizing extracellular fluid volume by contributing to oncotic pressure known also as colloid osmotic pressure of plasma because smaller animals for example rats function at a lower blood pressure they need less oncotic pressure to

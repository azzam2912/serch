it is also known by various authors as the principal pivot transform or as the sweep gyration or exchange operator given an formula 1 matrix formula 2 over a vector space formula 3 partitioned into blocks if formula 5 is invertible then the partial inverse of formula 6 around the pivot block formula 5 is created by inverting formula 5 putting the schur complement formula 9 in place of formula 10 and adjusting the off diagonal elements accordingly conceptually partial inversion corresponds to a rotation of the graph of the matrix formula 12 such that for conformally partitioned column matrices formula 13 and formula 14 as defined this way this operator is its own inverse formula 16 and if the pivot block formula 5 is chosen to be the entire matrix then the transform simply gives the matrix inverse formula 18 note that some authors define a related operation under one of the other names which is not an inverse per se particularly one common definition instead has formula 19 the transform is often presented as a pivot around a single non zero element formula 20 in which case one has partial inverses obey a number of nice properties use

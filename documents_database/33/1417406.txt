this was a copy of a german weapon designed by rheinmetall that was sold to the soviets before hitler came to power in 1933 that had been enlarged to to reuse a large stock of old 47mm ammunition it was used by the soviet navy to equip almost all of their ships from 1934 as its primary light anti aircraft gun until replaced by the fully automatic 37 mm 70 k gun from 1942 to 1943 it was used in world war ii and during the cold war as the soviets exported their world war ii era ships to their friends and allies however it was not very effective as its slow rate of fire and lack of a time fuze required a direct hit to damage targets the 46 caliber 21 k was a minimal adaptation of the 53 k anti tank gun that was created by taking the latter s barrel and mounting it on a simple pedestal mount its semi automatic breech automatically ejected the cartridge case and locked open ready for the next round this was less than ideal for an anti aircraft weapon that relied on its rate of fire to inflict damage on aircraft

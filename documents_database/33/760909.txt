they are not dangerous to human health but are used to indicate the presence of a health risk each gram of human feces contains approximately 100 billion bacteria these bacteria may include species of pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella or campylobacter associated with gastroenteritis in addition feces may contain pathogenic viruses protozoa and parasites fecal material can enter the environment from many sources including waste water treatment plants livestock or poultry manure sanitary landfills septic systems sewage sludge pets and wildlife if sufficient quantities are ingested fecal pathogens can cause disease the variety and often low concentrations of pathogens in environmental waters makes them difficult to test for individually public agencies therefore use the presence of other more abundant and more easily detected fecal bacteria as indicators of the presence of fecal contamination the us environmental protection agency epa lists the following criteria for an organism to be an ideal indicator of fecal contamination none of the types of indicator organisms that are currently in use fit all of these criteria perfectly however when cost is considered use of indicators becomes necessary commonly used indicator bacteria include total coliforms or a subset of this group fecal coliforms which are found

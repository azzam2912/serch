in a uniform gravitational field the center of mass serves as the center of gravity this is a very good approximation for smaller bodies near the surface of earth so there is no practical need to distinguish center of gravity from center of mass in most applications such as engineering and medicine in a non uniform field gravitational effects such as potential energy force and torque can no longer be calculated using the center of mass alone in particular a non uniform gravitational field can produce a torque on an object even about an axis through the center of mass the center of gravity seeks to explain this effect formally a center of gravity is an application point of the resultant gravitational force on the body such a point may not exist and if it exists it is not unique one can further define a unique center of gravity by approximating the field as either parallel or spherically symmetric the concept of a center of gravity as distinct from the center of mass is rarely used in applications even in celestial mechanics where non uniform fields are important since the center of gravity depends on the external field its motion

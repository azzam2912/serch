the road allows drivers traveling between marin county to the west and solano county to the north to bypass central richmond the original idea for the richmond parkway came from a state proposal for state route 93 in the early 1980s however when the state did not implement the plan local officials assembled 200 million in state and local funds to fund a road largely following the same route as proposed route 93 which was built in the 1990s while it mostly functions as an expressway some parts do not meet state expressway standards the city of richmond would like caltrans to take it over but currently caltrans is not in favor of the idea it was originally named richmond bypass because it would allow motorists to avoid entering the streets of richmond this was considered offensive to many community members sensitive to the idea of isolation and a process locals termed as environmental racism leading to the term parkway being used instead in place of bypass the entire route is in richmond contra costa county

there are differences in the calendars of other churches of the anglican communion see saints in anglicanism the only person canonised in a near conventional sense by the church of england since the english reformation is king charles the martyr king charles i although he is not widely recognised by anglicans as a saint outside the society of king charles the martyr the church of england has no mechanism for canonising saints and unlike the roman catholic church it makes no claims regarding the heavenly status of those whom it commemorates in its calendar for this reason the church of england avoids the use of the prenominal title saint with reference to uncanonised individuals and is restrained in what it says about them in its liturgical texts in order not to seem to imply grades of sanctity or to discriminate between holy persons of the pre and post reformation periods the title saint is not used at all in the calendar even with reference to those who have always been known by that title for example the apostles the ninth lambeth conference held in 1958 clarified the commemoration of saints and heroes of the christian church in the anglican communion

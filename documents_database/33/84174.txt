atavisms can occur in several ways one of which is when genes for previously existing phenotypic features are preserved in dna and these become expressed through a mutation that either knocks out the overriding genes for the new traits or makes the old traits override the new one a number of traits can vary as a result of shortening of the fetal development of a trait neoteny or by prolongation of the same in such a case a shift in the time a trait is allowed to develop before it is fixed can bring forth an ancestral phenotype atavisms are often seen as evidence of evolution in social sciences atavism is the tendency of reversion for example people in the modern era reverting to the ways of thinking and acting of a former time the word atavism is derived from the latin atavus a great great great grandfather or more generally an ancestor evolutionarily traits that have disappeared phenotypically do not necessarily disappear from an organism s dna the gene sequence often remains but is inactive such an unused gene may remain in the genome for many generations as long as the gene remains intact a fault in the genetic

the sequence takes its name from the fact that it represents the sequence of left and right folds along a strip of paper that is folded repeatedly in half in the same direction if each fold is then opened out to create a right angled corner the resulting shape approaches the dragon curve fractal for instance the following curve is given by folding a strip four times to the right and then unfolding to give right angles this gives the first 15 terms of the sequence when 1 represents a right turn and 0 represents a left turn starting at n 1 the first few terms of the regular paperfolding sequence are the value of any given term t in the regular paperfolding sequence can be found recursively as follows if n m 2 where m is odd then thus t t 0 but t 1 the paperfolding word 1101100111001001 which is created by concatenating the terms of the regular paperfolding sequence is a fixed point of the morphism or string substitution rules as follows it can be seen from the morphism rules that the paperfolding word contains at most three consecutive 0s and at most three consecutive 1s the

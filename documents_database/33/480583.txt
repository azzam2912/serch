kneser graphs are named after martin kneser who first investigated them in 1955 the complete graph on vertices is the kneser graph the complement of the line graph of the complete graph on vertices is the kneser graph the kneser graph is known as the odd graph the odd graph is isomorphic to the petersen graph the johnson graph is the graph whose vertices are the element subsets of an element set two vertices being adjacent when they meet in a element set for the johnson graph is the complement of the kneser graph johnson graphs are closely related to the johnson scheme both of which are named after selmer m johnson the generalized kneser graph has the same vertex set as the kneser graph but connects two vertices whenever they correspond to sets that intersect in or fewer items thus the bipartite kneser graph has as vertices the sets of and items drawn from a collection of elements two vertices are connected by an edge whenever one set is a subset of the other like the kneser graph it is vertex transitive with degree formula 1 the bipartite kneser graph can be formed as a bipartite double cover of

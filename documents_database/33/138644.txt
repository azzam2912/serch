it sold millions of units positioning amd as a legitimate competitor to intel rather than being merely a second source for x86 cpus then termed 8086 family while the am386 cpu was essentially ready to be released prior to 1991 intel kept it tied up in court amd had previously been a second source manufacturer of intel s intel 8086 intel 80186 and intel 80286 designs and amd s interpretation of the contract made up in 1982 was that it covered all derivatives of them intel however claimed that the contract only covered the 80286 and prior processors and forbade amd the right to manufacture 80386 cpus in 1987 after a few years in the courtrooms amd finally won the case and the right to sell their am386 in march 1991 this also paved the way for competition in the 80386 compatible 32 bit cpu market and so lowered the cost of owning a pc while intel s 386 cpus had topped out at 33 mhz in 1989 amd introduced 40 mhz versions of both its 386dx and 386sx out of the gate extending the lifespan of the architecture in the following two years the amd 386dx 40 saw popularity

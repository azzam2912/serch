o dichotoma can be found in climates from the arctic to the tropics in protected waters such as marches and creeks but not near open coasts like beaches in depths up to 250m o dichotoma uses asexual and sexual reproduction and feeds on mainly zooplankton and fecal pellets obelia dichotoma has a complex relationship with the ecosystem and many economic systems a thecate hydroid with a hydrotheca long enough to enclose the hydranth feeding polyp when fully contracted the bell or goblet shaped hydrotheca lacks an operculum but contains a diaphragm at the base and changes to a brown color over time the rim of the hydrotheca is smooth or softly toothed and can be used to distinguish o dichotoma from other obelia species o dichotoma polyp heigh ranges from 215 300 m and diameter from 210 275 m the colony of o dichotoma forms slender alternative branching stems with hydrocauli up to 350 mm tall with the hydranths located on thin stalks the medusae of o dichotoma swim freely in water and are disk shaped with 16 or more tentacles the medusae tentacles are not highly specialized but contain nematocysts grouped in rings obelia dichotoma can be distinguished from

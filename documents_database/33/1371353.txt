the standard arises out of the recognition that the exclusive right to make copies of a work would be meaningless if copyright infringement were limited to making only exact and complete reproductions of a work many courts also use substantial similarity in place of probative or striking similarity to describe the level of similarity necessary to prove that copying has occurred a number of tests have been devised by courts to determine substantial similarity they may rely on expert or lay observation or both and may subjectively judge the feel of a work or critically analyze its elements to win a claim of copyright infringement in civil or criminal court a plaintiff must show he or she owns a valid copyright the defendant actually copied the work and the level of copying amounts to misappropriation under the doctrine of substantial similarity a work can be found to infringe copyright even if the wording of text has been changed or visual or audible elements are altered confusion arises because some courts use substantial similarity in two different contexts during a copyright infringement case in the first context it refers to that level of similarity sufficient to prove that copying has occurred

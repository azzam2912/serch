this effect is achieved through small additions of manganese oxide often cristallo has a low lime content which makes it prone to glass corrosion otherwise known as glass disease the invention of cristallo glass is attributed to angelo barovier around 1450 in addition to common glass making materials manganese quartz pebbles and alume catino a particularly suitable form of soda ash are used in the making of cristallo glass rather than using common sand crushed quartz pebbles were used instead the quartz pebbles were typically from the ticino and the adige rivers the quartz pebbles went through a rigorous screening process before being selected for use in cristallo production the quartz pebbles had to be free of yellow and black veins and also had to be able to produce sparks when struck with steel if the quartz pebbles passed the selection process then the pebbles were heated to the point where the stones began to glow and then placed into cold water then the pebbles were crushed and ground the typical flux was used in the production of cristallo was called alume catino alume catino was derived from the ash of the salsola soda and salsola kali bushes that grew

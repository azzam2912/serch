furthermore each component of the link can be assumed to be unknotted the theorem was proved in the early 1960s by w b r lickorish and andrew h wallace independently and by different methods lickorish s proof rested on the lickorish twist theorem which states that any orientable automorphism of a closed orientable surface is generated by dehn twists along 3 g 1 specific simple closed curves in the surface where g denotes the genus of the surface wallace s proof was more general and involved adding handles to the boundary of a higher dimensional ball a corollary of the theorem is that every closed orientable 3 manifold bounds a simply connected compact 4 manifold by using his work on automorphisms of non orientable surfaces lickorish also showed that every closed non orientable connected 3 manifold is obtained by dehn surgery on a link in the non orientable 2 sphere bundle over the circle similar to the orientable case the surgery can be done in a special way which allows the conclusion that every closed non orientable 3 manifold bounds a compact 4 manifold

the standard ulam sequence the 1 2 ulam sequence starts with u 1 and u 2 then for n 2 u is defined to be the smallest integer that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger than all earlier terms as a consequence of the definition 3 is an ulam number 1 2 and 4 is an ulam number 1 3 here 2 2 is not a second representation of 4 because the previous terms must be distinct the integer 5 is not an ulam number because 5 1 4 2 3 the first few terms are there are infinitely many ulam numbers for after the first n numbers in the sequence have already been determined it is always possible to extend the sequence by one more element is uniquely represented as a sum of two of the first n numbers and there may be other smaller numbers that are also uniquely represented in this way so the next element can be chosen as the smallest of these uniquely representable numbers ulam is said to have conjectured that the numbers have zero density but they seem to have a density of approximately 0

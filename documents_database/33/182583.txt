some members of this family lack chlorophyll and are mycotrophic also called myco heterotrophic the family tends to be saprophytic and even the autotrophic species are all endomycorrhizal and probably at least hemisaprophytic the family occurs worldwide with a mostly tropic to subtropical distribution a number of species are threatened john lindley described the family as burmanniae with the single genus burmannia in 1830 in 1998 the apg i system placed burmanniaceae as one of five families in the order dioscoreales within the monocot clade the apg ii system of 2003 as a result of an extensive study by caddick and colleagues 2002 using an analysis of three genes rbc l atp b and 18s rdna in addition to morphological criteria led to a considerable rearrangement of the families within dioscoreales in apg ii the circumscription of the family was wider and included the plants that belonged to the family thismiaceae in apg i the result was an order with only three families apg iii 2009 left this arrangement unchanged nevertheless some ongoing research has challenged this relationship claiming that the older classification better reflects the evolutionary relationships between the genera according to these researchers the constituent clades are as

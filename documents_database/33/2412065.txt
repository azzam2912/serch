the singly charged ion can be any of the full range of potassium rubidium cesium ammonium nh4 or thallium as a mineral the ammonium nickel salt nh ni so can be called nickelboussingaultite with sodium the double sulfate is nickelbl dite nani so from the bl dite family nickel can be substituted by other divalent metals of similar sized to make mixtures that crystallise in the same form nickel forms double salts with tutton s salt structure with tetrafluoroberyllate with the range of cations of ammonia potassium rubidium cesium and thallium anhydrous salts of the formula mni so which can be termed metal nickel triusulfates belong to the family of langbeinites the known salts include nh ni so kni so and rbni so and those of tl and cs are predicted to exist some minerals are double salts for example nickelzippeite ni uo so oh 16ho which is isomorphic to cobaltzippeite magnesiozippeite and zinczippeite part of the zippeite group double hydrides of nickel exist such as mgnih double fluorides include the above mentioned fluoroanion salts and those fluoronickelates such as nif and nif other odd ones include an apple green coloured knif ho and nanif ho aluminium nickel pentafluoride alnif

more broadly a connectome would include the mapping of all neural connections within an organism s nervous system the production and study of connectomes known as connectomics may range in scale from a detailed map of the full set of neurons and synapses within part or all of the nervous system of an organism to a macro scale description of the functional and structural connectivity between all cortical areas and subcortical structures the term connectome is used primarily in scientific efforts to capture map and understand the organization of neural interactions within the brain research has successfully constructed the full connectome of one animal the roundworm caenorhabditis elegans beginning with the first electron micrographs published by white brenner et al 1986 based on this seminal work the first ever connectome then called neural circuitry database by the authors for c elegans was published in book form with accompanying floppy disks by achacoso and yamamoto in 1992 with the very first paper on the computer representation of its connectome presented and published three years earlier in 1989 by achacoso at the symposium on computer application in medical care scamc brenner acknowledged the publication of achacoso s book further neural network characterization

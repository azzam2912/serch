the mmp2 gene is located on chromosome 16 at position 12 2 proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase mmp family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix ecm in normal physiological processes such as embryonic development reproduction and tissue remodeling as well as in disease processes such as arthritis and metastasis most mmp s are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases this gene encodes an enzyme which degrades type iv collagen the major structural component of basement membranes the enzyme plays a role in endometrial menstrual breakdown regulation of vascularization and the inflammatory response the role of mmp2 in lymphangiogenesis was considered in a modelling and theoretical study mmp2 degrades collagen i to switch on different patterning mechanisms for vegfc activation of mmp 2 requires proteolytic processing a complex of membrane type 1 mmp mt1 mmp mmp14 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 recruits pro mmp 2 from the extracellular milieu to the cell surface activation then requires an active molecule of mt1 mmp and auto catalytic cleavage clustering of integrin chains promotes activation of mmp 2 another factor that will support the activation of mmp 2 is cell cell clustering a wild type

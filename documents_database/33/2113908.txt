there can be i pancytopenia ii diarrhea and or mucositis and or iii immune deficiency due to t cell dysfunction and hypoimmunoglobulinemia resulting in pneumonia usually due to pneumocystis jirovecii recently several infants with the immune deficiency syndrome were described untreated or with inadequate treatment there are progressive systemic and neurological signs with a spectrum of manifestations including seizures that are often intractable females with hfm are fertile and if folate sufficient during pregnancy have normal offspring subjects that carry one mutated pcft allele are normal the genomic and clinical features of hfm were recently reviewed extensive clinical studies established that hfm is due to i impaired intestinal absorption of folates and ii impaired transport of folates across the blood choroid plexus cerebrospinal fluid csf barrier hence patients with hfm have very low or undetectable folate blood levels when a modest dose of a folate is given by mouth there is impaired intestinal folate absorption without other signs of malabsorption the molecular basis for hfm was established in 2006 with the identification of the proton coupled folate transporter pcft as the mechanism of intestinal absorption of folates and the detection of loss of function mutations in this transporter in subjects

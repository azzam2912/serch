they uniquely differ from all other agnostina in having the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the headshield or glabella wider than the rear lobe the condylopygidae are the only family assigned to the condylopygoidea superfamily the condylopygoidea are a small and isolated branch in the agnostina suborder it occurs approximately at the same moment in time as the peronopsidae the earliest representatives of the main branch of the agnostina one species peronopsis palmadon is intermediate between peronopsidae and condylopygidae but it is not clear whether p palmadon is ancestral to the condylopigidae a regression towards ancestral characters or an example of parallel evolution like all agnostida members of the condylopygidae are diminutive with the headshield or cephalon and tailshield or pygidium of approximately the same size or isopygous and outline and only two thorax segments the characteristic sidewise expansion of the frontal lobe of the glabella occipital structures instead of basal lobes and a rhachis with three pairs of side lobes and a rear lobe differentiate condylopygoidea from agnostoidea

like any pyramid it is self dual the regular pentagonal pyramid has a base that is a regular pentagon and lateral faces that are equilateral triangles it is one of the johnson solids j its height h from the midpoint of the pentagonal face to the apex as a function of a where a is the side length can be computed as its surface area a can be computed as the area of pentagonal base plus five times the area of one triangle its volume when an edge length is known can be figured out with this formula it can be seen as the lid of an icosahedron the rest of the icosahedron forms a gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid j one of the 92 johnson solids named and described by norman johnson in 1966 more generally an order 2 vertex uniform pentagonal pyramid can be defined with a regular pentagonal base and 5 isosceles triangle sides of any height the pentagrammic star pyramid has the same vertex arrangement but connected onto a pentagram base the pentagonal pyramid is topologically a self dual polyhedron the dual edge lengths are different due to the polar reciprocation

the switch from one regime to another depends on the past values of the x series hence the self exciting portion of the name the model consists of k autoregressive ar parts each for a different regime the model is usually referred to as the setar k p model where k is the number of regimes and p is the order of the autoregressive part since those can differ between regimes the p portion is sometimes dropped and models are denoted simply as setar k consider a simple ar p model for a time series y where written in a following vector form where setar models were introduced by howell tong in 1977 and more fully developed in the seminal paper tong and lim 1980 they can be thought of in terms of extension of autoregressive models allowing for changes in the model parameters according to the value of weakly exogenous threshold variable z assumed to be past values of y e g y where d is the delay parameter triggering the changes defined in this way setar model can be presented as follows where the setar model is a special case of tong s general threshold autoregressive models tong

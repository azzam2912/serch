a atomistic hence algebraic semimodular bounded lattice is called a matroid lattice because such lattices are equivalent to simple matroids an atomistic semimodular bounded lattice of finite length is called a geometric lattice and corresponds to a matroid of finite rank semimodular lattices are also known as upper semimodular lattices the dual notion is that of a lower semimodular lattice a finite lattice is modular if and only if it is both upper and lower semimodular a finite lattice or more generally a lattice satisfying the ascending chain condition or the descending chain condition is semimodular if and only if it is m symmetric some authors refer to m symmetric lattices as semimodular lattices a lattice is sometimes called weakly semimodular if it satisfies the following condition due to garrett birkhoff every semimodular lattice is weakly semimodular the converse is true for lattices of finite length and more generally for upper continuous relatively atomic lattices the following two conditions are equivalent to each other for all lattices they were found by saunders mac lane who was looking for a condition that is equivalent to semimodularity for finite lattices but does not involve the covering relation every lattice satisfying mac lane

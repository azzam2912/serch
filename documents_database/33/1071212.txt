species of tetraspora are unicellular green algae that exist in arrangements of four and consist of cells being packaged together in a gelatinous envelope that creates macroscopic colonies these are primarily freshwater organisms although there have been few cases where they have been found inhabiting marine environments and even contaminated water bodies tetraspora species can be found all around the globe with the exception of antarctica despite the ubiquitous presence greatest growth of the genera s species is seen in the polar climatic zones tetraspora species are non motile and instead of having flagella they possess pairs of pseudoflagella which are part of the pseudociliary apparatus on average the cell diameter of tetraspora ranges from 6 13 m energy is accumulated via photosynthesis through two cup shaped chloroplasts making the species primary producers blooms have been noted in contaminated environments due to excess augmentation of ammonia from industrial waste and are now being associated with the drop in biodiversity in such water bodies both sexual and asexual reproduction are possible for species within this genus in addition mitosis is well defined in tetraspora species particularly investigated in t gelatinosa cell division involves elaborate arrangement of microtubules basal body complexes and

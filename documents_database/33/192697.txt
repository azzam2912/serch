originally such clocks showed each decimal digit of sexagesimal time as a binary value but presently binary clocks also exist which display hours minutes and seconds as binary numbers most binary clocks are digital although analog varieties exist true binary clocks also exist which indicate the time by successively halving the day instead of using hours minutes or seconds similar clocks based on gray coded binary also exist most common binary clocks use six columns of leds to represent zeros and ones each column represents a single decimal digit a format known as binary coded decimal bcd the bottom row in each column represents 1 or 2 with each row above representing higher powers of two up to 2 or 8 to read each individual digit in the time the user adds the values that each illuminated led represents then reads these from left to right the first two columns represent the hour the next two represent the minute and the last two represent the second since zero digits are not illuminated the positions of each digit must be memorized if the clock is to be usable in the dark binary clocks that display time in binary coded sexagesimal also

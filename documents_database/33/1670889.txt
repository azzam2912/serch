it is known from fossil imprints of a single small skeleton mgb v1 which was found in muschelkalk outcrops near the municipalities of mont ral and alcover in spain these outcrops are dated to the ladinian age of the middle triassic about 242 to 237 million years ago the specimen is stored at the museu martorell a k a the museu geologia de barcelona which is now part of the museu de ci ncies naturals de barcelona the poor preservation and likely juvenile nature of the specimen has led to the anatomy of cosesaurus being misidentified by several different sources for example paul ellenberger claimed that it was an ancestor to birds in the 1970s while dave peters claimed that it was a pterosaur ancestor in 2000 both of these claims contrast with mainstream scientific theories on the origins of either group and other paleontologists who study the specimen are unable to find the features which ellenberger or peters reported to be present the ellenberger and peters hypotheses are thus considered fringe theories with questionable scientific soundness due to their low reproducibility mainstream hypotheses for the relations of cosesaurus generally agree that it is a protorosaur specifically a tanystropheid closely

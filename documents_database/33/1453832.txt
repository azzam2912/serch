these lactotripeptides are derived from casein which is a milk protein also found in dairy products although most normal dairy products contain lactotripeptides they are inactive within the original milk proteins dairy peptides can be effectively released through enzymatic predigestion a process by which milk protein is enzymatically broken down into smaller pieces some clinical studies have suggested that these lactotripeptides help promote healthy blood pressure levels as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle however other clinical trials have seen no effects from these compounds dairy peptides are proposed to inhibit the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme ace ace is part of the renin angiotensin system a natural mechanism that helps regulate blood pressure in the body in certain individuals the renin angiotensin system can become overactive often due to stress an unhealthy diet and or unhealthy lifestyle under such conditions ace becomes overactive and converts more angiotensin i into angiotensin ii angiotensin ii causes blood vessels to constrict and so increases blood pressure which has potential to lead to hypertension but when ace activity is inhibited the formation of angiotensin ii is reduced this then helps the blood vessels to relax and expand back to a normal

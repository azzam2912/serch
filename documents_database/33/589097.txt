development of both tracked and half track apcs began in 1941 both versions were confusingly designated type 1 see the type 1 ho ha half track the fully tracked type 1 ho ki was built by hino motors but only in small quantities although the japanese army had employed mechanized infantry formations in china from the mid 1930s the general view of field commanders was that armored transports were too slow compared with normal trucks and thereby unable to keep up with the speed necessary for contemporary infantry tactics in addition with the priorities of japanese military production focusing on combat aircraft warships and other offensive weaponry most of the experimental apc and afv designs never made it past the prototype stage by the time the type 1 ho ki entered mass production in 1944 raw materials were in very short supply and much of japan s industrial infrastructure had been destroyed by american bombing the total number produced is unknown the type 1 ho ki had an unusual silhouette in that the driver s cab did not extend across the front of the hull but stopped about mid way across the center line only one driver was required who

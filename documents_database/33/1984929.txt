they were motivated to define the opposite of a regular graph a concept which has been thoroughly studied and well understood defining an irregular graph was not immediately obvious in a k regular graph all vertices have degree k in any graph g two vertices in g must have the same degree so an irregular graph cannot be defined as a graph with all vertices of different degrees one may be tempted then to define an irregular graph as having all vertices of distinct degrees except for two but these types of graphs are also well understood and thus not interesting graph theorists thus turned to the issue of local regularity a graph is locally regular at a vertex v if all vertices adjacent to v have degree r a graph is thus locally irregular if for each vertex v of g the neighbors of v have distinct degrees and these graphs are thus termed highly irregular graphs some facts about highly irregular graphs outlined by alavi et al this last observation can be considered analogous to a result of d nes k nig which states that if h is a graph with greatest degree r then there is a

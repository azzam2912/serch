it is unusual being a complex with five nitrate groups and being a nitrate complex of a light element with nitrate such a complex with five nitrate groups is called a pentanitratometallate there is a pentanitrato complex with cerium pphet ce no tetranitratoaluminate and hexanitratoaluminate are related anions with aluminium at their core there are two different arrangements for the coordination of nitrate with aluminium in the complex one nitrate is bonded with two oxygens to the aluminium bidentate and the other five oxygen atoms only link via one oxygen monodentate the bidentate nitrate has an o al length of 1 98 another two al o bonds roughly in the same plane have a length of 1 89 the other two al o bonds complete a distorted octahedral arrangement and pop out the top and bottom of the aluminium with a length of 1 93 the bidentate connected nitrate group is distorted so that the uncoordinated terminal oxygen bond is shorter than the coordinated oxygen nitrogen distance 1 22 versus 1 31 the angles are also warped with coordinated oxygen angle subtended on the nitrogen of 109 and angle of these oxygen atoms with the terminal atom of 126 the

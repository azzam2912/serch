it was released in 2007 at the playstation store in addition to downloading music from the internet users may also use their own music to play along to in the my music challenge mode beats automatically loads the track titles and artist names of the songs it finds on the user s psp however the game will only read up to 127 tracks for the user to choose from there is as yet no explanation from sony for this limitation nor is it obvious how the game determines which 127 tracks are loaded from the library what is known is that the game loads the same set of tracks from the user s music directory each time during the game three stationary targets or landing points just one in novice mode are spaced evenly at the center of the screen symbols appear from off the screen and glide towards these targets in rhythm with the music the symbols represent notes that players are meant to synchronize their button presses to and are identified by the four playstation face buttons circle x square and triangle these notes are generated based on the rhythm of the music using a beat tracking algorithm

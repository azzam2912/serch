these proteins are about 200 250 residues in length and exhibit 7 tmss homologues are found in a variety of gram negative and gram positive bacteria yeast fungi plants animals and viruses the e coli genome encodes three paralogues ybhl ybhm and ycca distant homologues found in drosophilia melanogaster and the rat are the n methyl d aspartate receptor associated protein nmdarai and the n methyl d aspartate receptor glutamate binding chain respectively two others are the rat neural membrane protein 35 and the arabidopsis thaliana bax inhibitor 1 bi 1 protein capable of suppressing bax induced cell death in yeast one of these proteins tegt or the bax inhibitor 1 tc 1 a 14 1 1 has a c terminal domain that forms a ca permeable channel bi 1 is an er localized protein that protects against apoptosis and er stress bi 1 has been proposed to modulate er ca homeostasis by acting as a ca leak channel these proteins are distantly related to the ionotropic glutamate binding protein of the n methyl d aspartate nmda receptor of man homologues include a putative cold shock inducible protein and a secy stabilizing protein based on experimental determination of the bi

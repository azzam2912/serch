a rolling component is typically pressed onto an axle and mounted directly on a rail car or locomotive or indirectly on a bogie uk also called a truck north america wheels are cast or forged and are heat treated to have a specific hardness new wheels are trued using a lathe to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle all wheel profiles need to be periodically monitored to ensure proper wheel rail interface improperly trued wheels increase rolling resistance reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation a railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts the wheel itself and the tire or tyre around the outside a rail tire is usually made from steel and is typically heated and pressed onto the wheel where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools monobloc wheels do not have encircling tires while resilient rail wheels have a resilient material such as rubber between the wheel and tire most train wheels have a conical geometry which is the primary means of keeping the train s motion aligned with the track train wheels have a flange on one side to keep the wheels and hence the train running on the rails

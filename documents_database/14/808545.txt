it is a bacterial cyclic lipopeptide largely prominent for its exceptional surfactant power its amphiphilic properties help this substance to survive in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments it is an antibiotic produced by the gram positive endospore forming bacteria bacillus subtilis in the course of various studies of its properties surfactin was found to exhibit effective characteristics like antibacterial antiviral antifungal anti mycoplasma and hemolytic activities surfactin s structure consists of a peptide loop of seven amino acids l aspartic acid l leucine glutamic acid l leucine l valine and two d leucines and a hydrophobic fatty acid chain thirteen to fifteen carbons long which allows it to penetrate cellular membranes glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues at positions 1 and 5 respectively constituting a minor polar domain on the opposite side valine residue at position 4 extends down facing the fatty acid chain making up a major hydrophobic domain below critical micellar concentrations cmcs the fatty acid tail can extend freely into solution and then participate in hydrophobic interactions within micelles this antibiotic is synthesized by a linear nonribosomal peptide synthetase surfactin synthetase and has in solution a characteristic horse saddle conformation pdb that explains its large spectrum of

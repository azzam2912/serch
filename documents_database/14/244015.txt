rail grinders were developed to increase the lifespan of the tracks being serviced for rail corrugation rail grinding is a process that is done to stop the deformation due to use and friction on railroad tracks by removing deformations and corrosion railroad tracks that experience continual use are more likely to experience corrugation and overall wear rail grinders are used to grind the tracks when rail corrugation is present or before corrugation begins to form on the tracks major freight train tracks use rail grinders for track maintenance based the interval of tonnage rather than time transit systems and subways in major cities continue to use scheduled rail grinding processes to combat the corrugation common to heavily used tracks rail grinding equipment may be mounted on a single self propelled vehicle or on a dedicated rail grinding train which when used on an extensive network may include crew quarters the grinding wheels of which there may be more than 100 are set at controlled angles to restore the track to its correct profile the machines have been in use in north america the united kingdom and europe since the early 20th century they are made by specialist rail maintenance companies

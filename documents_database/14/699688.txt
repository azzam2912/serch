the silver halide crystals in the film emulsion are flatter and more tabular hence t grain in panchromatic emulsions the sensitivity of the silver halide crystal is enhanced by sensitizing dyes that adsorb on the crystal surface therefore sensitivity can be increased by adsorbing more sensitizing dye this requires increasing the surface area of the crystal and also improving the dye molecules to form a dense assembly tabular grain emulsion solves the first part of this problem tabular crystals tend to lie along the film s surface when coated and dried this reduces scattering of light and increases resolution tabular crystals usually have two twinned planes parallel to each other they are formed at the very beginning of the crystallization the crystal tends to grow at the edges and not on the main planes forming very thin crystals of very large surface areas tabular crystals probably existed from very early days of silver gelatin photography however it was about 1970 when emulsion engineers could make emulsions that consisted mainly of tabular crystals moreover it was not until the 1980s that tabular crystals began to be used in production emulsions tabular grain technology brought significant improvements to the image quality of

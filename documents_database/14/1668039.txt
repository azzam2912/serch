simulation allows to predict the behaviour of gas network systems under different conditions such predictions can be effectively used to guide decisions regarding the design and operation of the real system depending on the gas flow characteristics in the system there are two states that can be matter of simulation in the gas networks simulation and analysis matrices turned out to be the natural way of expressing the problem any network can be described by set of matrices based on the network topology consider the gas network by the graph below the network consists of one source node reference node l1 four load nodes 2 3 4 and 5 and seven pipes or branches for network analysis it is necessary to select at least one reference node mathematically the reference node is referred to as the independent node and all nodal and branch quantities are dependent on it the pressure at source node is usually known and this node is often used as the reference node however any node in the network may have its pressure defined and can be used as the reference node a network may contain several sources or other pressure defined nodes and these form a

its original form due to max born and vladimir fock 1928 was stated as follows in simpler terms a quantum mechanical system subjected to gradually changing external conditions adapts its functional form but when subjected to rapidly varying conditions there is insufficient time for the functional form to adapt so the spatial probability density remains unchanged at some initial time formula 1 a quantum mechanical system has an energy given by the hamiltonian formula 2 the system is in an eigenstate of formula 2 labelled formula 4 changing conditions modify the hamiltonian in a continuous manner resulting in a final hamiltonian formula 5 at some later time formula 6 the system will evolve according to the time dependent schr dinger equation to reach a final state formula 7 the adiabatic theorem states that the modification to the system depends critically on the time formula 8 during which the modification takes place for a truly adiabatic process we require formula 9 in this case the final state formula 7 will be an eigenstate of the final hamiltonian formula 5 with a modified configuration the degree to which a given change approximates an adiabatic process depends on both the energy separation between

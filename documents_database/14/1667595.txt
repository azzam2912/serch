both of these refer to networks connecting oscillators where oscillators are nodes that emit a signal with somewhat regular possibly variable frequency and are also capable of receiving a signal particularly interesting is the phase transition where the entire network or a very large percentage of oscillators begins pulsing at the same frequency known as synchronization the synchronization network then becomes the substrate through which synchronization of these oscillators travels since there is no central authority organizing nodes this is a form of self organizing system generally oscillators can be biological electronic or physical some examples are fireflies crickets heart cells lasers microwave oscillators and neurons further example can be found in many domains in a particular system oscillators may be identical or non identical that is either the network is made up of homogeneous or heterogeneous nodes properties of oscillators include frequency phase and natural frequency network edges describe couplings between oscillators couplings may be physical attachment or consist of some proximity measure through a medium such as air or space networks have several properties including number of nodes oscillators network topology and coupling strength between oscillators kuramoto developed a major analytical framework for coupled dynamical systems as follows

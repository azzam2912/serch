the intermediate step between reflection and translation can look different from the starting configuration so objects with glide symmetry are in general not symmetrical under reflection alone in group theory the glide plane is classified as a type of opposite isometry of the euclidean plane a single glide is represented as frieze group p11g a glide reflection can be seen as a limiting rotoreflection where the rotation becomes a translation it can also be given a schoenflies notation as s coxeter notation as 2 and orbifold notation as the combination of a reflection in a line and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a reflection in a parallel line however a glide reflection cannot be reduced like that thus the effect of a reflection combined with any translation is a glide reflection with as special case just a reflection these are the two kinds of indirect isometries in 2d for example there is an isometry consisting of the reflection on the x axis followed by translation of one unit parallel to it in coordinates it takes it fixes a system of parallel lines the isometry group generated by just a glide reflection is an infinite cyclic group combining two

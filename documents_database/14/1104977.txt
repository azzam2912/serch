the software provides a flexible environment to display manipulate and analyze small and large molecules proteins nucleic acids and their interactions the first version of the what if software was developed by gert vriend in 1987 at the university of groningen groningen netherlands most of its development occurred during 1989 2000 at the european molecular biology laboratory embl in heidelberg germany other contributors include chris sander and wolfgang kabsch the software is maintained by the vriend group at the dutch center for molecular and biomolecular informatics cmbi in nijmegen netherlands it is available for in house use or as a web based resource the original paper describing what if has been cited more than 3 000 times what if provides a flexible environment to display manipulate and analyze small molecules proteins nucleic acids and their interactions one notable use was detecting many millions of errors often small but sometimes catastrophic in protein data bank pdb files what if also provides an environment for homology modeling of protein tertiary structures and quaternary structures validating protein structures notably those deposited in the pdb correcting protein structures visualising macromolecules and their interaction partners for example lipids drugs ions and water and manipulating macromolecules

more precisely the plaintext space of the ckks scheme is formula 1 for some power of two integer formula 2 to deal with the complex plaintext vector efficiently cheon et al proposed plaintext encoding decoding methods which exploits a ring isomorphism formula 3 given a plaintext vector formula 4 and a scaling factor formula 5 the plaintext vector is encoded as a polynomial formula 6 by computing formula 7 where formula 8 denotes the coefficient wise rounding function given a message polynomial formula 9 and a scaling factor formula 5 the message polynomial is decoded to a complex vector formula 11 by computing formula 12 here the scaling factor formula 13 enables us to control the encoding decoding error which is occurred by the rounding process namely one can obtain the approximate equation formula 14 by controlling formula 15 where formula 16 and formula 17 denote the encoding and decoding algorithm respectively from the ring isomorphic property of the mapping formula 3 for formula 19 and formula 20 the following hold where formula 23 denotes the hadamard product of the same length vectors these properties guarantee the approximate correctness of the computations in the encoded state when the scaling factor

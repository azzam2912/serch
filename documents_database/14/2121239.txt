a similar definition exists in topological dynamics given a class formula 1 of topological spaces formula 2 is universal for formula 1 if each member of formula 1 embeds in formula 5 menger stated and proved the case formula 6 of the following theorem the theorem in full generality was proven by n beling theorem the formula 7 dimensional cube formula 8 is universal for the class of compact metric spaces whose lebesgue covering dimension is less than formula 9 n beling went further and proved theorem the subspace of formula 8 consisting of set of points at most formula 9 of whose coordinates are rational is universal for the class of separable metric spaces whose lebesgue covering dimension is less than formula 9 the last theorem was generalized by lipscomb to the class of metric spaces of weight formula 13 formula 14 there exist a one dimensional metric space formula 15 such that the subspace of formula 16 consisting of set of points at most formula 9 of whose coordinates are rational suitably defined is universal for the class of metric spaces whose lebesgue covering dimension is less than formula 9 and whose weight is less than formula 13

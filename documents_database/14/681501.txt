bromine is in the 1 oxidation state hypobromite is the bromine compound analogous to hypochlorites found in common bleaches and in immune cells in many ways hypobromite functions in the same manner as hypochlorite and is also used as a germicide and antiparasitic in both industrial applications and in the immune system hypobromite salts form upon treating bromine with aqueous alkali such as sodium or potassium hydroxide at 20 c the reaction is rapid in this reaction the bromine disproportionates some undergoes reduction and some oxidation from oxidation state 0 br to oxidation state 1 br and oxidation state 1 bro sodium hypobromite can be isolated as an orange solid a secondary reaction where hypobromite spontaneously disproportionates to bromide bromine oxidation state 1 and bromate bromine oxidation state 5 takes place rapidly at 20 c and slowly at 0 c hence in reaction 2 the formation and proportions of the 1 1 and 5 bromine oxidation state products can be controlled by temperature hypobromite is not thermodynamically stable at any ph see pourbaix diagram for bromine at http www eosremediation com download chemistry chemical 20properties eh ph diagrams pdf but it is kinetically locked toward a further disproportion into bromate

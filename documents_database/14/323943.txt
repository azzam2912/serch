this gene is located on the short arm of the x chromosome xp22 2 the rps6ka3 gene makes a protein that is involved with signaling within cells researchers believe that this protein helps control the activity of other genes and plays an important role in the brain the protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that are required for learning the formation of long term memories and the survival of nerve cells the protein rsk2 which is encoded by the rps6ka3 gene is a kinase which phosphorylates some substrates like creb and histone h3 rsk2 is involved at the distal end of the ras mapk signaling pathway mutations in the rps6ka3 disturb the function of the protein but it is unclear how a lack of this protein causes the signs and symptoms of coffin lowry syndrome at this time more than 120 mutations have been found some people with the features of coffin lowry syndrome do not have identified mutations in the rps6ka3 gene in these cases the cause of the condition is unknown this condition is inherited in an x linked dominant pattern a condition is considered x linked if the gene that causes the disorder is located on

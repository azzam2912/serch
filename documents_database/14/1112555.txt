this pathway is called 1 4 dihydroxy 2 naphthoate biosynthesis i vitamin k is a quinone that serves as an electron transporter during anaerobic respiration this process of anaerobic respiration allows the bacteria to generate the energy required to survive the systematic name for the mene enzyme is 2 succinylbenzoate coa ligase amp forming other names for this enzyme include o succinylbenzoate coa synthase o succinylbenzoyl coenzyme a synthetase osb coa synthetase osb coa ligase synthetase and o succinylbenzoyle coenzyme a the ec number is 6 2 1 26 mene belongs to the ligase enzyme family or class 6 in the presence of 0 5mm of ca 2 k na and zn 2 the enzyme activity was increased twofold in the presence of 5 mm of co 2 and mn 2 the enzyme activity was increased fourfold mg 2 is the ion that increases the enzyme activity the most with 5 mm of mg 2 enzyme activity was increased sixfold inhibitors of this enzyme include diethylprocarbonate fe 2 hg 2 and mg 2 above 1mm the maximum specific enzymatic activity is 3 2 micromol min mg the optimum ph is 7 5 the maximum ph is 8 the optimum temperature

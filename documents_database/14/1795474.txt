it is mostly employed for finding the patch that introduced a bug another application area is finding the patch that indirectly fixed a bug the process of locating the changeset that introduced a specific regression was described as source change isolation in 1997 by brian ness and viet ngo of cray research regression testing was performed on cray s compilers in editions comprising one or more changesets editions with known regressions could not be validated until developers addressed the problem source change isolation narrowed the cause to a single changeset that could then be excluded from editions unblocking them with respect to this problem while the author of the change worked on a fix ness and ngo outlined linear search and binary search methods of performing this isolation code bisection has the goal of minimizing the effort to find a specific change set it employs a divide and conquer algorithm that depends on having access to the code history which is usually preserved by revision control in a code repository code history has the structure of a directed acyclic graph which can be topologically sorted this makes it possible to use a divide and conquer search algorithm which bisection is

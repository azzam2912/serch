the number of described species currently stands at around 1050 in 29 genera but the number of species is undoubtedly much higher than this and increases each time a new estimate is made adult beetles in this family are some shade of brown and between in length the antennae have eight to eleven segments the terminal one to three segments forming a club the elytra are wider than the head and thorax and are punctured by rows of small pits the dorsal surface is rough most species are unable to fly these beetles and their larvae are obligate feeders on the hyphae and spores of fungi moulds and mildews they occur in damp places where such fungi are found under bark in leaf litter in decaying plant material in timber stacked outdoors and in ant and termite nests they may be present in ripening cereal crops but will not persist in clean dry stored grain however damp grain or grain heavily contaminated by other insects will support them they may infest brewers yeast and contaminate food by introducing mould spores species of dienerella have caused the deterioration of foodstuffs and hygiene problems in a hospital have been linked to dienerella

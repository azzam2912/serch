if is a character of g then the artin conductor of is the number where g is the i th ramification group in lower numbering of order g and g is the average value of on g by a result of artin the local conductor is an integer if is unramified then its artin conductor is zero if l is unramified over k then the artin conductors of all are zero the wild invariant or swan conductor of the character is in other words the sum of the higher order terms with i 0 the global artin conductor of a representation of the galois group g of a finite extension l k of global fields is an ideal of k defined to be where the product is over the primes p of k and f p is the local artin conductor of the restriction of to the decomposition group of some prime of l lying over p since the local artin conductor is zero at unramified primes the above product only need be taken over primes that ramify in l k suppose that l is a finite galois extension of the local field k with galois group g the artin

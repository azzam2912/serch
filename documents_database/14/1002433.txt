brady in an early version of the study brady placed monkeys in restraining chairs and conditioned them to press a lever they were given electric shocks every 20 seconds unless they pressed the lever during the same time period this study came to an abrupt halt when many of the monkeys died from perforated ulcers to test this brady used a yoked control monkey he placed an executive monkey in the restraining chair which could press the lever to prevent the electric shock the yoked monkey had no control over the lever leaving only the executive with the psychological stress of pushing the lever after 23 days of a continuous 6 hours on 6 hours off schedule of electric shocks the executive monkey died brady then tried various schedules but no monkeys died from this he then returned to the original 6 on 6 off and tested the stomachs of the executives and found that their stomach acidity was greatest during the rest period the greatest danger occurred when the sympathetic arousal stopped and the stomach was flooded with digestive hormones this was a parasympathetic rebound associated with the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis which led to the development of ulcers

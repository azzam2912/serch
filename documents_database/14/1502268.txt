vertices of the truncated 6 cube are located as pairs on the edge of the 6 cube vertices of the bitruncated 6 cube are located on the square faces of the 6 cube vertices of the tritruncated 6 cube are located inside the cubic cells of the 6 cube the truncated 6 cube may be constructed by truncating the vertices of the 6 cube at formula 1 of the edge length a regular 5 simplex replaces each original vertex the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a truncated 6 cube having edge length 2 are the permutations of the truncated 6 cube is fifth in a sequence of truncated hypercubes the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a bitruncated 6 cube having edge length 2 are the permutations of the bitruncated 6 cube is fourth in a sequence of bitruncated hypercubes the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of a tritruncated 6 cube having edge length 2 are the permutations of these polytopes are from a set of 63 uniform 6 polytopes generated from the b coxeter plane including the regular 6 cube or 6 orthoplex

these calculations complement the p k values reported for amino acids in their free state and are used frequently within the fields of molecular modeling structural bioinformatics and computational biology p k values of amino acid side chains play an important role in defining the ph dependent characteristics of a protein the ph dependence of the activity displayed by enzymes and the ph dependence of protein stability for example are properties that are determined by the p k values of amino acid side chains the p k values of an amino acid side chain in solution is typically inferred from the p k values of model compounds compounds that are similar to the side chains of amino acids see amino acid for the p k values of all amino acid side chains inferred in such a way there are also numerous experimental studies that have yielded such values for example by use of nmr spectroscopy the table below lists the model p k values that are often used in a protein p k calculation and contains a third column based on protein studies when a protein folds the titratable amino acids in the protein are transferred from a solution like

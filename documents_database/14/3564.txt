it is the digital analogue of optical film compositing the basic operation used in digital compositing is known as alpha blending where an opacity value is used to control the proportions of two input pixel values that end up a single output pixel as a simple example suppose two images of the same size are available and they are to be composited the input images are referred to as the foreground image and the background image each image consists of the same number of pixels compositing is performed by mathematically combining information from the corresponding pixels from the two input images and recording the result in a third image which is called the composited image consider three pixels and then considering all three colour channels and assuming that the colour channels are expressed in a 1 colour space that is to say the measured values are proportional to light intensity we have note that if the operations are performed in a colour space where is not equal to 1 then the operation will lead to non linear effects which can potentially be seen as aliasing artifacts or jaggies along sharp edges in the matte more generally nonlinear compositing can have

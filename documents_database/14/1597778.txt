plant cover is not biased by the size and distributions of individuals and is an important and often measured characteristic of the composition of plant communities plant cover data may be used to classify the studied plant community into a vegetation type to test different ecological hypothesis on plant abundance and in gradient studies where the effects of different environmental gradients on the abundance of specific plant species are studied the most common way to measure plant cover in herbal plant communities is to make a visual assessment of the relative area covered by the different species in a small plot see quadrat the visually assessed cover of a plant species is then recorded as a continuous variable between 0 and 1 or divided into interval classes as an ordinal variable an alternative methodology called the pin point method or point intercept method has also been widely employed in a pin point analysis a frame with a fixed grid pattern is placed randomly above the vegetation and a thin pin is inserted vertically through one of the grid points into the vegetation the different species touched by the pin are recorded at each insertion the cover of plant species k

the x rays are produced by matter falling from one component called the donor usually a relatively normal star to the other component called the accretor which is very compact a neutron star or black hole the infalling matter releases gravitational potential energy up to several tenths of its rest mass as x rays hydrogen fusion releases only about 0 7 percent of rest mass the lifetime and the mass transfer rate in an x ray binary depends on the evolutionary status of the donor star the mass ratio between the stellar components and their orbital separation an estimated 10 positrons escape per second from a typical low mass x ray binary x ray binaries are further subdivided into several sometimes overlapping subclasses that perhaps reflect the underlying physics better note that the classification by mass high intermediate low refers to the optically visible donor not to the compact x ray emitting accretor a low mass x ray binary lmxb is a binary star system where one of the components is either a black hole or neutron star the other component a donor usually fills its roche lobe and therefore transfers mass to the compact star in lmxb systems the

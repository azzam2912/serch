the average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero speed has the dimensions of distance divided by time the si unit of speed is the metre per second but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour or in the us and the uk miles per hour for air and marine travel the knot is commonly used the fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel according to special relativity is the speed of light in a vacuum c metres per second approximately or matter cannot quite reach the speed of light as this would require an infinite amount of energy in relativity physics the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed italian physicist galileo galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time in equation form that is where formula 2

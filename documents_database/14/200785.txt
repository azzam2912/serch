drr is like weighted fair queuing wfq a packet based implementation of the ideal generalized processor sharing gps policy it was proposed by m shreedhar and g varghese in 1995 as an efficient with o 1 complexity and fair algorithm in drr a scheduler handling n flows is configured with one quantum formula 1 for each flow this global idea is that at each round the flow formula 2 can send at most formula 1 bytes and the remaining if any is reported to the next round in this way the flow of number will achieve a minimal long term data rate of formula 4 where formula 5 is the link rate the drr scans all non empty queues in sequence when a non empty queue formula 2 is selected its deficit counter is incremented by its quantum value then the value of the deficit counter is a maximal amount of bytes that can be sent at this turn if the deficit counter is greater than the packet s size at the head of the queue hoq this packet can be sent and the value of the counter is decremented by the packet size then the size of the next

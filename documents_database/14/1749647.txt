it is the lowest energy state the ground state of the electromagnetic field when the fields are quantized when planck s constant is hypothetically allowed to approach zero qed vacuum is converted to classical vacuum which is to say the vacuum of classical electromagnetism another field theoretic vacuum is the qcd vacuum of the standard model the qed vacuum is subject to fluctuations about a dormant zero average field condition here is a description of the quantum vacuum it is sometimes attempted to provide an intuitive picture of virtual particles based upon the heisenberg energy time uncertainty principle where and are energy and time variations and the planck constant divided by 2 arguing along the lines that the short lifetime of virtual particles allows the borrowing of large energies from the vacuum and thus permits particle generation for short times this interpretation of the energy time uncertainty relation is not universally accepted however one issue is the use of an uncertainty relation limiting measurement accuracy as though a time uncertainty determines a budget for borrowing energy another issue is the meaning of time in this relation because energy and time unlike position and momentum for example do not satisfy a

in contrast with other cryocoolers e g stirling cryocooler and gm refrigerators this cryocooler can be made without moving parts in the low temperature part of the device making the cooler suitable for a wide variety of applications pulse tube cryocoolers are used in industrial applications such as semiconductor fabrication and in military applications such as for the cooling of infrared sensors pulse tubes are also being developed for cooling of astronomical detectors where liquid cryogens are typically used such as the atacama cosmology telescope or the qubic experiment an interferometer for cosmology studies ptrs are used as precoolers of dilution refrigerators pulse tubes are particularly useful in space based telescopes such as the james webb space telescope where it is not possible to replenish the cryogens as they are depleted it has also been suggested that pulse tubes could be used to liquefy oxygen on mars figure 1 represents the stirling type single orifice pulse tube refrigerator ptr which is filled with a gas typically helium at a pressure varying from 10 to 30 bar from left to right the components are the part in between x and x is thermally insulated from the surroundings usually by vacuum the

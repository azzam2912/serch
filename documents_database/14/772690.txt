the type species d forbesi from england bohemia and sweden was discovered and described by the french paleontologist joachim barrande in 1850 the glabella was inflated and globular shaped and covered in small wart like bumps if it was filled with fat or oil the glabellum would have helped to have made the creature positively buoyant on the other hand trilobites with large glabellae are often suspected of being predatory as the volume of glabella would be filled with digestive organs or used to store captured swallowed prey the free cheeks of the cephalon formed a pair of long curved spines and the segments of the pleural lobes were separated and elongated to form rib like struts these modifications along with the v shaped pygidium give these trilobites a cartoon fish skeleton appearance the defensive value of these highly elongate spines is also apparent as they would have stuck in the throats of vertebrate predators such as the silurian acanthodian nostolepis each species differed from each other in the sizes of their glabella as well as the size and curves of the pygidium and free cheek spines cheirurids had the ability to enroll to protect their softer ventral area and

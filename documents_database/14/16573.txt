put another way a set of strings called code words over an alphabet is called a self synchronizing code if for each string obtained by concatenating two code words the substring starting at the second symbol and ending at the second last symbol does not contain any code word as substring every self synchronizing code is a prefix code but not all prefix codes are self synchronizing other terms for self synchronizing code are synchronized code or ambiguously comma free code a self synchronizing code permits the proper framing of transmitted code words provided that no uncorrected errors occur in the symbol stream external synchronization is not required self synchronizing codes also allow recovery from uncorrected errors in the stream with most prefix codes an uncorrected error in a single bit may propagate errors further in the stream and make the subsequent data corrupted importance of self synchronizing codes is not limited to data transmission self synchronization also facilitates some cases of data recovery for example of a digitally encoded text counterexamples in utf 8 bit patterns codice 1 and codice 2 are used to mark the beginning of the next valid character

it is involved in the chelation of ferric iron fe from the surrounding environment and is subsequently transferred into the bacterial cytoplasm via the use of abc transporters the biosynthetic pathway of bacillibactin was first identified by may et al in the gram positive b subtilis the siderophore is synthesized through multimodular non ribosomal peptide synthetases nrps similar to enterobactin however unlike enterobactin the genes responsible for encoding the bacillibactin synthetases are all located in one operon this gene cluster is termed dhb cognate to the catecholic structure of 2 3 dihydroxybenzoate dhb and it can be divided into the specific genes responsible for encoding the enzymes the three genes are dhbe dhbb and dhbf which get translated into dhbe dhbb and dhbf synthetases notably dhbf was characterized as a dimodular nrps unlike the monomodular entf synthetase for enterobactin the structure of bacillibactin consists of three 2 3 dihydroxybenzoate dhb groups attached to a cyclic amino acid core synthesized by multimodular nrps it is the condensation of three dhb glycine threonine units that ultimately leads to the formation of bacillibactin in the first step of nrps the relevant amino acid is adenylated and transferred to the thiol group of the

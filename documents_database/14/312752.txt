it has been said that because the melvins already had a contract with atlantic records prick was released with the band name in mirror writing which resulted in some sites such as rateyourmusic crediting it to snivlem the album displays a distinctly experimental quality with an eclectic selection including field recordings electronic effects and loops band jam sessions a stereotypical drum solo that segues into an archetypal heavy metal guitar solo and a track that s introduced as pure digital silence followed by silence for a minute singer guitarist buzz osborne has stated that prick is a total noise crap record we did strictly for the weirdness factor complete and utter nonsense a total joke the band claimed that they wanted to call the album kurt kobain but changed it after cobain s death to eliminate the possibility of people mistaking it for a tribute record they implied that cobain a friend and collaborator since their teenage years in rural washington was actually the titular prick because he died and therefore forced them to change the album s name all songs written by the melvins

although the plas was in montgomeryshire the station was across the afon dulas in merionethshire the station was built at llwyngwern rather than at pantperthog because there is a very tight bend and a steep gradient on the railway at pantperthog immediately to the south of the station was the junction between the main line of the corris railway and the horse worked branch that served the llwyngwern quarry which is now the home of the centre for alternative technology the branch was built after 1887 there was a short siding at the start of the branch which was used to store wagons waiting to travel on the corris railway the branch ran on top of a high slate embankment and crossed the afon dulas on a timber viaduct on the east bank another slate embankment took the branch over the ffridd gate to pont ifans road on a high bridge and on to the bottom of the quarry here an incline led up to the quarry mill level and a long tunnel ran to the bottom of the main quarry pit around 1927 the wooden bridge was declared unsafe and the branch was abandoned part of the station building

alpha 7 integrin is critical for modulating cell matrix interactions alpha 7 integrin is highly expressed in cardiac muscle skeletal muscle and smooth muscle cells and localizes to z disc and costamere structures mutations in itga7 have been associated with congenital myopathies and noncompaction cardiomyopathy and altered expression levels of alpha 7 integrin have been identified in various forms of muscular dystrophy itga7 encodes the protein alpha 7 integrin alpha 7 integrin is 128 9 kda in molecular weight and 1181 amino acids in length integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain alpha 7 integrin undergoes post translational cleavage within the extracellular domain to yield disulfide linked light and heavy chains that join with beta 1 to form an integrin that binds to the extracellular matrix protein laminin 1 the primary binding partners of alpha 7 integrin are laminin 1 alpha1 beta1 gamma1 laminin 2 alpha2 beta1 gamma1 and laminin 4 alpha2 beta2 gamma1 alpha 7 beta 1 is the major integrin complex expressed in differentiated muscle cells splice variants of alpha 7 integrin that differ in both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains exist in the mouse and are developmentally regulated in

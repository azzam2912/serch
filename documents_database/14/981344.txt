oomycetes also known as water molds are fungal like protists they are fungal like because of their similar life cycles but differ in that the resting stage is diploid they have coenocytic hyphae a larger genome cellulose in their cell walls instead of chitin and contain zoospores asexual motile spores and oospores sexual resting spores pythium irregulare is an oomycete that causes pre and post emergence damping off as well as root rot pre emergence damping off occurs when p irregulare infects seeds before they emerge causing them to rot and turn brown thus preventing successful growth alternatively post emergence damping off occurs when the oomycete infects just after the seed has germinated this usually causes infection in the roots and stem which appears as water soaking and necrosis depending on the severity plants may collapse or be severely stunted in plants that are older and more established p irregulare causes root rot this will initially cause necrotic lesions which leads to chlorosis reduced yield poor growth and stunting due to inadequate water and nutrient acquisition by the roots additionally p irregulare is often found coinfecting with other pythium species all three of these diseases caused by p irregulare can

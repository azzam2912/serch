critics of the current patent system such as joseph e stiglitz say that patents fail to provide incentives for innovations which are not commercially marketable stiglitz provides the idea of prizes instead of patents to be awarded in order to further advance solutions to global problems such as aids patents essentially provide a temporary monopoly on a product to the first inventor or firm which comes up with the product patents vary in length but are designed to last long enough for the innovator to make a return on investment the nature of patents makes them an incentive so long as the product being invented is distributed to consumers through markets while patented products are in the market the producer can place any price on the product regardless of the price of production which typically dictates prices in markets if a product is not being distributed through markets then a patent cannot provide proper incentive for innovation patents do however provide gain through the restriction of information to others stiglitz identifies this as a problem of patents for the innovation of drugs and other products being distributed not with the purpose of making a profit but to solve global problems

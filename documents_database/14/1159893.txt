all tools in the david bioinformatics resources aim to provide functional interpretation of large lists of genes derived from genomic studies e g microarray and proteomics studies david can be found at http david niaid nih gov or http david abcc ncifcrf gov the david bioinformatics resources consists of the david knowledgebase and five integrated web based functional annotation tool suites the david gene functional classification tool the david functional annotation tool the david gene id conversion tool the david gene name viewer and the david niaid pathogen genome browser the expanded david knowledgebase now integrates almost all major and well known public bioinformatics resources centralized by the david gene concept a single linkage method to agglomerate tens of millions of diverse gene protein identifiers and annotation terms from a variety of public bioinformatics databases for any uploaded gene list the david resources now provides not only the typical gene term enrichment analysis but also new tools and functions that allow users to condense large gene lists into gene functional groups convert between gene protein identifiers visualize many genes to many terms relationships cluster redundant and heterogeneous terms into groups search for interesting and related genes or terms dynamically view

they are mainly due to differences in pressure or temperature they are divided into horizontal and vertical currents both are present at mesoscale while horizontal ones dominate at synoptic scale air currents are not only found in the troposphere but extend to the stratosphere and mesosphere a difference in air pressure causes an air displacement and generates the wind the coriolis force deflects the air movement to the right in the northern hemisphere and the left in the southern one which makes the winds parallel to the isobars on an elevation in pressure card it s called the geostrophic wind pressure differences depend in turn the average temperature in the air column as the sun does not heat the earth evenly there is a temperature difference between the poles and the equator creating air masses with more or less homogeneous temperature with latitude differences in atmospheric pressure are also at the origin of the general atmospheric circulation while the air masses are separated by ribbons where temperature changes rapidly these are the fronts along these areas higher winds aloft form these horizontal jets jet streams can reach speeds of several hundred kilometers per hour and can span thousands of kilometers

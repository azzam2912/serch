the album was recorded in 2003 and released by winter winter in his review for allmusic alex henderson said akchot s guitar playing is free spirited but relatively accessible certainly by avant garde jazz standards and he speaks a language that is primarily a jazz language but incorporates elements of blues rock folk and latin music and observed that the album won t go down in history as a five star masterpiece but it s a thoughtful enjoyably sincere way for akchot to acknowledge sharrock s legacy all about jazz said sonny ii is thoroughly flawed to the extent it s disjointed and underdeveloped and to some that might be reason enough for disqualification but i don t think no l akchot or sonny sharrock would have it any other way to be sure akchot doesn t pack the same raw visceral punch that sharrock did but his roots are clear his debts are paid and this record is proof jazztimes reviewer aaron steinberg observed the obtuse french born guitarist doesn t attempt to replicate sharrock s fearsome sound this personal almost diaristic recording instead considers sharrock the composer refracted through the guitarist s imagination all compositions by sonny sharrock

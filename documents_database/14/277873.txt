it is generally found in the quicktime container with the fourcc rle it can perform either lossless or lossy compression and is one of the few video codecs that supports an alpha channel supported color depths are 1 bit monochrome 15 bit rgb 24 bit rgb 32 bit argb as well as palettized rgb as a result of reverse engineering of the format a decoder is implemented in xanim as well as an encoder and decoder in libavcodec quicktime animation uses run length encoding and conditional replenishment for compression when encoding the input frame is scanned pixel wise in raster scan order and processed line wise within a line pixels are segmented into runs the length of which is variable and signaled in the bitstream for each run one of three coding modes is used same color skip or pcm in same color mode a run of pixels is represented by a single color in a run length encoding fashion if pixels with different colors are joined into a run of a single color by the encoder the coding process is lossy otherwise it is lossless the lossless mode is used at the 100 quality level in skip mode the

they are present in insects mollusks echinoderms and chordates the mechanism of action of pgrps varies between taxa in insects pgrps kill bacteria indirectly by activating one of four unique effector pathways prophenoloxidase cascade activation of toll pathway activation of imd pathway and induction of phagocytosis in mammals pgrps kill bacteria directly by interacting with their peptidoglycan cell wall pgrps contain at least one c terminal peptidoglycan recognition domain which is about 165 amino acids long this peptidoglycan binding type 2 amidase domain is homologous to bacteriophage and bacterial type 2 amidases insects generate up to 19 alternatively spliced pgrps classified into long l and short s forms for instance the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster expresses 13 pgrps which are alternatively spliced into 19 proteins while the mosquito anopheles gambiae expresses 7 pgrps with 9 splice variants mammals have up to four pgrps all of which are secreted these are peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 pglyrp1 peptidoglycan recognition protein 2 pglyrp2 peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 pglyrp3 and peptidoglycan recognition protein 4 pglyrp4

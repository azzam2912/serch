this largely brown bird which commonly holds its tail raised is found in scrubland and lightly wooded habitats often near rocks from kenya and ethiopia to gambia a large part if its range is in the sudanian savanna as traditionally defined it is the only member of ptilopachus but based on genetic evidence this genus also includes the nahan s francolin there is some confusion in the naming of this species because the name of this bird in many languages translates literally into english as rock partridge for instance in dutch the species is rotspatrijs in german felsenhenne in french poulette de roche all literal translations of rock partridge the bird known as rock partridge in english is actually a member of another genus the alectoris graeca the confusion is further compounded as in some languages alectoris species are known by names that literally translate as stone partridge in dutch steenpatrijs in german steinhuhn red legged partridge a rufa being rode steenpatrijs in dutch further complication arises as particularly within the usa the name rock partridge has been used for a variety of alectoris species and hybrids the international bird trade for sport aviaries and meat has led to misapplication

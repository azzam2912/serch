content sniffing is generally used to compensate for a lack of accurate metadata that would otherwise be required to enable the file to be interpreted correctly content sniffing techniques tend to use a mixture of techniques that rely on the redundancy found in most file formats looking for file signatures and magic numbers and heuristics including searching for well known representative substrings the use of byte frequency and n gram tables and bayesian inference mime sniffing was and still is used by some web browsers including notably microsoft s internet explorer in an attempt to help web sites which do not correctly signal the mime type of web content display however doing this opens up a serious security vulnerability in which by confusing the mime sniffing algorithm the browser can be manipulated into interpreting data in a way that allows an attacker to carry out operations that are not expected by either the site operator or user such as cross site scripting moreover by making sites which do not correctly assign mime types to content appear to work correctly in those browsers it fails to encourage the correct labeling of material which in turn makes content sniffing necessary for these

as such they have the best known chemistry of the actinides along with that of plutonium as the self heating and radiation from them is not enough to cause radiolysis of chemical bonds as it is for the other actinides while the later actinides from americium onwards are predominantly trivalent and behave more similarly to the corresponding lanthanides as one would expect from periodic trends the early actinides up to plutonium thus including thorium and uranium have relativistically destabilised and hence delocalised 5f and 6d electrons that participate in chemistry in a similar way to the early transition metals of group 3 through 8 thus all their valence electrons can participate in chemical reactions although this is not common for neptunium and plutonium a thorium atom has 90 electrons of which four are valence electrons four atomic orbitals are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy 5f 6d 7s and 7p however the 7p orbital is greatly destabilised and hence it is not occupied in the ground state of any thorium ion despite thorium s position in the f block of the periodic table it has an anomalous rn 6d7s electron configuration in the ground state as the 5f

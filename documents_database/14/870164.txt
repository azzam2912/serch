these receptors are similar to type i cytokine receptors except they do not possess the signature sequence wsxws that is characteristic of type i receptors typically type ii cytokine receptors are heterodimers or multimers with a high and a low affinity component currently no complete structure of the extracellular domains of a type ii cytokine receptor is available these receptors are related predominantly by sequence similarities in their extracellular portions that are composed of tandem ig like domains the intracellular domain of type ii cytokine receptors is typically associated with a tyrosine kinase belonging to the janus kinase jak family type ii cytokine receptors include those that bind type i and type ii interferons and those that bind members of the interleukin 10 family interleukin 10 interleukin 20 and interleukin 22 the interferon receptor is a molecule displayed on the surface of cells which allows them to interact with the anti viral substance interferon the receptor is genetically coded for by number of different genes as there are a few distinct types of interferon interferon receptor deficiency is a condition showing some amenability to genetic therapy

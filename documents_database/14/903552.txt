a pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely when a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting equilibrium position it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position when released the restoring force combined with the pendulum s mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position swinging back and forth the time for one complete cycle a left swing and a right swing is called the period the period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on its weight distribution the moment of inertia about its own center of mass and the amplitude width of the pendulum s swing for a point mass on a weightless string of length l swinging with an infinitesimally small amplitude without resistance the length of the string will be numerically equal to l g where g is the acceleration due to gravity with units of length per second squared and l is the length of the string in the same units using the si recommended acceleration due to gravity of g 9 80665 m s the length of the string

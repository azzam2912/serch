because the boiling point of a liquid rises with pressure the contents of the pressurized vessel can remain liquid so long as the vessel is intact if the vessel s integrity is compromised the loss of pressure and dropping boiling point can cause the liquid to rapidly convert to gas and expand extremely rapidly there are three characteristics of liquids which are relevant to the discussion of a bleve typically a bleve starts with a container of liquid which is held above its normal atmospheric pressure boiling temperature many substances normally stored as liquids such as co propane and other similar industrial gases have boiling temperatures at atmospheric pressure far below room temperature in the case of water a bleve could occur if a pressurized chamber of water is heated far beyond the standard that container because the boiling water pressurizes it is capable of holding liquid water at very high temperatures if the pressurized vessel containing liquid at high temperature which may be room temperature depending on the substance ruptures the pressure which prevents the liquid from boiling is lost if the rupture is catastrophic where the vessel is immediately incapable of holding any pressure at all then there

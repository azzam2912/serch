the membrane can be used for different tasks membrane reactors are an example for the combination of two unit operations in one step e g membrane filtration with the chemical reaction submerged and sidestream membrane bioreactors in wastewater treatment plants are the most developed filtration based membrane reactors the production of chloride cl2 and caustic soda naoh from nacl is carried out industrially by the chlor alkali process using a proton conducting polyelectrolyte membrane it is used on large scale and has replaced diaphragm electrolysis nafion has been developed as a bilayer membrane to withstand the harsh conditions during the chemical conversion in biological systems membranes fulfil a number of essential functions the compartmentalisation of biological cells is achieved by membranes the semi permeability allows to separate reactions and reaction environments a number of enzymes are membrane bound and often mass transport through the membrane is active rather than passive as in artificial membranes allowing the cell to keep up gradients for example by using active transport of protons or water the use of a natural membrane is the first example of the utilisation for a chemical reaction by using the selective permeability of a pig s bladder water could

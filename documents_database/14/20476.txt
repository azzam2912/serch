this is similar to the way a musical chord can be expressed in terms of the volumes and frequencies of its constituent notes the term fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of time the fourier transform of a function of time is itself a complex valued function of frequency whose magnitude modulus represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function and whose argument is the phase offset of the basic sinusoid in that frequency the fourier transform is not limited to functions of time but the domain of the original function is commonly referred to as the time domain there is also an inverse fourier transform that mathematically synthesizes the original function from its frequency domain representation linear operations performed in one domain time or frequency have corresponding operations in the other domain which are sometimes easier to perform the operation of differentiation in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by the frequency so some differential equations are easier to analyze in the frequency domain also convolution in the time domain corresponds to ordinary multiplication in the frequency domain see convolution

the concept originated during the cold war the typical depiction of the tactic is of a satellite containing a magazine of tungsten rods and a directional thrust system in science fiction the weapon is often depicted as being launched from a spaceship instead of a satellite when a strike is ordered the launch vehicle would brake one of the rods out of its orbit and into a suborbital trajectory that intersects the target as the rod approaches periapsis due to gravity it picks up immense speed until it reaches terminal velocity shortly before impact the rods would typically be shaped to minimize air resistance and maximize terminal velocity kinetic bombardment has the advantage of being able to deliver projectiles from a very high angle at a very high speed making them extremely difficult to defend against in addition projectiles would not require explosive warheads and in the simplest designs would consist entirely of solid metal rods giving rise to the common nickname rods from god disadvantages include the technical difficulties of ensuring accuracy and the high costs of positioning ammunition in orbit during the vietnam war there was limited use of the lazy dog bomb a steel projectile shaped like

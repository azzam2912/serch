then it is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus to any curve in a plane or space generally n dimensional rather than just the real line the gradient theorem implies that line integrals through gradient fields are path independent in physics this theorem is one of the ways of defining a conservative force by placing as potential is a conservative field work done by conservative forces does not depend on the path followed by the object but only the end points as the above equation shows the gradient theorem also has an interesting converse any path independent vector field can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field just like the gradient theorem itself this converse has many striking consequences and applications in both pure and applied mathematics if is a differentiable function from some open subset of to and if is a differentiable function from some closed interval to then by the multivariate chain rule the composite function is differentiable on and for all in here the denotes the usual inner product now suppose the domain of contains the differentiable curve with endpoints and oriented in the direction from to if parametrizes for in then the

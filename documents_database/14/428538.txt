in roman catholic and other western christian tradition it is the first sunday during the holy season of lent as on other sundays of lent it is customary to dispense from the fast on quadragesima since sundays are not counted among the forty days of lent the term quadragesima is derived from the latin word for fortieth as there are exactly forty days from quadragesima sunday until good friday however like quinquagesima sexagesima and septuagesima the numeral is more likely an approximation of how many days there are until easter sunday in this case 42 while quadragesima includes both sundays and weekdays the beginning of lent was later changed to the preceding wednesday ash wednesday to get in forty weekdays quadragesima sunday may occur as early as february 8 or as late as march 14 in both the ordinary form of the roman rite and common english parlance it is known as the first sunday of lent the buergbrennen festivities centred on a large bonfire are celebrated in the towns and villages of luxembourg on the first sunday of lent to herald the coming of spring

the dm2a4 seahake mod 4 is the first torpedo ever to be guided by a fiber optic wire with a fully digital system architecture increased range and speed and its new conformal array sonar with a very wide panoramic sensor angle as well as the additional wake homing sensor the dm2a4 seahake mod 4 provides greatly advanced performance over its predecessor the homing head shell is a hydrodynamic optimised parabolic shape which aims to reduce torpedo self noise and cavitation to an absolute minimum the homing head s conformal transducer array permits detection angles of 100 in the horizontal and 24 in the vertical therefore supporting larger acquisition angles in comparison to traditional flat arrays the wide angle array is designed to reduce maneuvering when in search and reconnaissance stages therefore also reducing self noise and preserving battery power the weapon has a modular design that includes up to four silver zinc battery modules and is able to achieve a range of more than 50 km 27 nmi and a speed exceeding 92 6 km h 50 kn powered by a high frequency permanent magnet motor with a closed loop cooling system independent from the environment exact performance data are

the concept of a best response is central to john nash s best known contribution the nash equilibrium the point at which each player in a game has selected the best response or one of the best responses to the other players strategies reaction also known as best response correspondences are used in the proof of the existence of mixed strategy nash equilibria section 1 3 b section 2 2 reaction correspondences are not reaction functions since functions must only have one value per argument and many reaction correspondences will be undefined i e a vertical line for some opponent strategy choice one constructs a correspondence formula 1 for each player from the set of opponent strategy profiles into the set of the player s strategies so for any given set of opponent s strategies formula 2 formula 3 represents player i s best responses to formula 2 response correspondences for all 2x2 normal form games can be drawn with a line for each player in a unit square strategy space figures 1 to 3 graphs the best response correspondences for the stag hunt game the dotted line in figure 1 shows the optimal probability that player y plays stag

it states that every d dimensional centrally symmetric polytope has at least 3 nonempty faces including the polytope itself as a face but not including the empty set in two dimensions the simplest centrally symmetric convex polygons are the parallelograms which have four vertices four edges and one polygon a cube is centrally symmetric and has 8 vertices 12 edges 6 square sides and 1 solid another three dimensional convex polyhedron the regular octahedron is also centrally symmetric and has 6 vertices 12 edges 8 triangular sides and 1 solid in higher dimensions the hypercube 0 1 has exactly 3 faces each of which can be determined by specifying for each of the d coordinate axes whether the face projects onto that axis onto the point 0 the point 1 or the interval 0 1 more generally every hanner polytope has exactly 3 faces if kalai s conjecture is true these polytopes would be among the centrally symmetric polytopes with the fewest possible faces in the same work as the one in which the 3 conjecture appears kalai conjectured more strongly that the f vector of every convex centrally symmetric polytope p dominates the f vector of at least one

his theoretical and experimental studies in statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics proved new means to reveal details of biochemical reactions taking place far from equilibrium and involving many chemical species born in vienna in 1926 ross left austria with his parents only days before the outbreak of world war ii they settled in new york where he studied chemistry at queens college b s 1948 with a two year interruption to serve in the army from 1944 to 1946 after completing his degree he went on to perform doctoral research in physical chemistry studying gas transport properties under the guidance of isador amdur at the massachusetts institute of technology ph d 1951 this led to postdoctoral work in gas thermometry and the statistical mechanical theory of irreversible processes with physical chemist john kirkwood at yale ross began his faculty career as assistant professor in chemistry at brown university in 1953 there he launched a program to test the viscosity of liquids as a function of temperature and pressure with unprecedented precision two years later he and physical chemist edward greene began nearly two decades of groundbreaking work developing the use of molecular beams to examine the molecular dynamics revealing details

commonly used equipment include box and pan brakes brake presses and other specialized machine presses typical products that are made like this are boxes such as electrical enclosures and rectangular ductwork in press brake forming a work piece is positioned over the die block and the die block presses the sheet to form a shape usually bending has to overcome both tensile stresses and compressive stresses when bending is done the residual stresses cause the material to towards its original position so the sheet must be over bent to achieve the proper bend angle the amount of spring back is dependent on the material and the type of forming when sheet metal is bent it stretches in length the bend deduction is the amount the sheet metal will stretch when bent as measured from the outside edges of the bend the bend radius refers to the inside radius the formed bend radius is dependent upon the dies used the material properties and the material thickness the u punch forms a u shape with a single punch there are three basic types of bending on a press brake each is defined by the relationship of the end tool position to the

the terminology conveys the idea that the elements of the semigroup are acting as transformations of the set from an algebraic perspective a semigroup action is a generalization of the notion of a group action in group theory from the computer science point of view semigroup actions are closely related to automata the set models the state of the automaton and the action models transformations of that state in response to inputs an important special case is a monoid action or act in which the semigroup is a monoid and the identity element of the monoid acts as the identity transformation of a set from a category theoretic point of view a monoid is a category with one object and an act is a functor from that category to the category of sets this immediately provides a generalization to monoid acts on objects in categories other than the category of sets another important special case is a transformation semigroup this is a semigroup of transformations of a set and hence it has a tautological action on that set this concept is linked to the more general notion of a semigroup by an analogue of cayley s theorem a note on

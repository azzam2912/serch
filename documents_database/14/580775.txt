its stability and relative nontoxicity allows it to be used as a detergent and emulsifier in a number of domestic scientific and pharmacological applications as the name implies the ethoxylation process leaves the molecule with 20 repeat units of polyethylene glycol in practice these are distributed across 4 different chains leading to a commercial product containing a range of chemical species polysorbate 20 is used as a wetting agent in flavored mouth drops such as ice drops helping to provide a spreading feeling to other ingredients like sd alcohol and mint flavor the world health organization has suggested acceptable daily intake limits of 0 25 mg of polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters per kg body weight in biological techniques and sciences polysorbate 20 has a broad range of applications for example it is used polysorbate 20 is used as an excipient in pharmaceutical applications to stabilize emulsions and suspensions polysorbate 20 is used by philatelists to remove stamps from envelopes and to remove residues from stamps without harming the stamp itself polysorbate 20 is also used as wetting agent in rubber balers in the elastomer industry polysorbate 20 has been used as a shape directing agent to synthesize spheroidal magnetite nanoassemblies

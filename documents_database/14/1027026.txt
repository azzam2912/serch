these cause the resist outside the scanned pattern to receive a non zero dose important contributions to weak resist polymer chain scission for positive resists or crosslinking for negative resists come from electron forward scattering and backscattering the forward scattering process is due to electron electron interactions which deflect the primary electrons by a typically small angle thus statistically broadening the beam in the resist and further in the substrate the majority of the electrons do not stop in the resist but penetrate the substrate these electrons can still contribute to resist exposure by scattering back into the resist and causing subsequent inelastic or exposing processes this backscattering process originates e g from a collision with a heavy particle i e substrate nucleus and leads to wide angle scattering of the light electron from a range of depths micrometres in the substrate the rutherford backscattering probability increases quickly with substrate nuclear charge the above effects can be approximated by a simple two gaussian model where a perfect point like electron beam is broadened to a superposition of a gaussian with a width formula 1 of a few nanometers to order tens of nanometers depending on the acceleration voltage due to

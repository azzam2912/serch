arm holdings develops the architecture and licenses it to other companies who design their own products that implement one of those architecturesincluding systems on chips soc and systems on modules som that incorporate memory interfaces radios etc it also designs cores that implement this instruction set and licenses these designs to a number of companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products processors that have a risc architecture typically require fewer transistors than those with a complex instruction set computing cisc architecture such as the x86 processors found in most personal computers which improves cost power consumption and heat dissipation these characteristics are desirable for light portable battery powered devicesincluding smartphones laptops and tablet computers and other embedded systems for supercomputers which consume large amounts of electricity arm could also be a power efficient solution arm holdings periodically releases updates to the architecture architecture versions armv3 to armv7 support 32 bit address space pre armv3 chips made before arm holdings was formed as used in the acorn archimedes had 26 bit address space and 32 bit arithmetic most architectures have 32 bit fixed length instructions the thumb version supports a variable length instruction set that provides both 32

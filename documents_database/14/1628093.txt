these conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics the thin or formal conception and the thick or substantive conception of the rule of law the thin conception often associated with the legal scholars albert venn dicey and joseph raz advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective clear stable and constitutionally enacted and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges while people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law they take the view that this is a matter of substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept of the rule of law on the other hand the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights a thin conception of the rule of law has generally been adopted by the singapore government and members of parliament

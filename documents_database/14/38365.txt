this may include hardware related services for example accessing a hard disk drive creation and execution of new processes and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling system calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system in most systems system calls can only be made from userspace processes while in some systems os 360 and successors for example privileged system code also issues system calls the architecture of most modern processors with the exception of some embedded systems involves a security model for example the rings model specifies multiple privilege levels under which software may be executed a program is usually limited to its own address space so that it cannot access or modify other running programs or the operating system itself and is usually prevented from directly manipulating hardware devices e g the frame buffer or network devices however many normal applications obviously need access to these components so system calls are made available by the operating system to provide well defined safe implementations for such operations the operating system executes at the highest level of privilege and allows applications to request services via system calls which are often initiated via interrupts an

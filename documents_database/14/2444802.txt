it has handlers for image files in the common netpbm and jpeg formats so it can for example specifically alter the frequency coefficients of jpeg files it is written in c and published as free software under the terms of the old bsd license it has been tested on a variety of unix like operating systems and is included in the standard software repositories of the popular linux distributions debian and arch linux via user repository and their derivatives an algorithm estimates the capacity for hidden data without the distortions of the decoy data becoming apparent outguess determines bits in the decoy data that it considers most expendable and then distributes secret bits based on a shared secret in a pseudorandom pattern across these redundant bits flipping some of them according to the secret data for jpeg images outguess recompresses the image to a user selected quality level and then embeds secret bits into the least significant bits lsb of the quantized coefficients while skipping zeros and ones subsequently corrections are made to the coefficients to make the global histogram of discrete cosine transform dct coefficients match that of the decoy image counteracting detection by the chi square attack that

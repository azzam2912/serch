these groups from least dense to most dense are chylomicrons aka uldl by the overall density naming convention very low density lipoprotein vldl intermediate density lipoprotein idl low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein hdl ldl delivers fat molecules to cells ldl can contribute to atherosclerosis if it is oxidized within the walls of arteries it is important to note that while in the popular press ldl may be called bad cholesterol much recent research has shown that is it not necessarily bad it is an essential transport system for lipids the human body needs to survive including cholesterol there is both large and small particle ldl and while only small is associated with cholesterol related issues neither is bad even small ldl is necessary to conduct nutrients to vessels that large ldl cannot reach lipoproteins transfer lipids fats around the body in the extracellular fluid making fats available to body cells for receptor mediated endocytosis lipoproteins are complex particles composed of multiple proteins typically 80 100 proteins particle organized by a single apolipoprotein b for ldl and the larger particles a single ldl particle is about 220 275 angstroms in diameter typically transporting 3 000 to 6 000 fat

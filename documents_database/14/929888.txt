it is named after anatoli fedorovich kapustinskii who published the formula in 1956 the calculated lattice energy gives a good estimation the real value differs in most cases by less than 5 furthermore one is able to determine the ionic radii or more properly the thermochemical radius using the kapustinskii equation when the lattice energy is known this is useful for rather complex ions like sulfate so or phosphate po kapustinskii originally proposed the following simpler form which he faulted as associated with antiquated concepts of the character of repulsion forces here k 1 079 j m mol this form of the kapustinskii equation may be derived as an approximation of the born land equation below kapustinskii replaced r the measured distance between ions with the sum of the corresponding ionic radii in addition the born exponent n was assumed to have a mean value of 9 finally kapustinskii noted that the madelung constant m was approximately 0 88 times the number of ions in the empirical formula the derivation of the later form of the kapustinskii equation followed similar logic starting from the quantum chemical treatment in which the final term is where d is as defined above replacing

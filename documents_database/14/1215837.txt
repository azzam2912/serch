each golden age introduces significant advancements in theoretical and experimental methods discernible time periods marking a golden age of advancements are for example the development of mechanics under galileo 1564 1642 and newton 1642 1727 another small epoch seen as a golden age is the unification of electricity magnetism and optics because of 19th century notables including faraday maxwell and others significant advancements in methods of investigation were introduced for celestial mechanics which includes realizing a universal gravitational force with the introduction of the telescope basing mechanics on experimental results was possible with the development of devices that could measure time and tools for measuring distance the advances in electromagnetism in the 19th century enamored physicists as another golden age closed and there was a reluctance to perceive further advancement hence the progress of one era termed a golden age has appeared to mark the completion of physics as a science yet this perception has turned out to be erroneous for example around 1980 stephen hawking predicted the end of theoretical physics within 20 years around 2001 he amended his prediction to twenty years more from that year steven weinberg predicts a unified physics by 2050 tadeusz lulek barbara lulek

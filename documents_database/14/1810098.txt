the end groups can also be part of a heterocycle or the double bonds part of an aromatic system the methine dye subclasses are based on the these structural differences methine dyes can futhermore be classified as cationic anionic or neutral if one or more methine groups are replaced by a heteroatom usually nitrogen one speaks of heteroanalogous aza analogous methine dyes methine dyes can be characterized as polyene dyes with terminal electron donating and accepting groups in the majority of cases these terminal groups contain nitrogen or oxygen atoms however while the naturally occurring polyene dyes such as carotenoids are limited to yellow to yellow red tones almost all colours of the spectrum can be achieved with the predominantly synthetic methine dyes the most well known group of methine dyes are the cationic cyanine dyes both terminal groups of the chromophore contain nitrogen atoms whereas the amino or imino group is part of a heterocycle in the case of hemicyanine dyes one terminal amino group is part of a heterocycle while the second terminal group is open chain if both terminal amino and imino groups of the chromophore are open chain one speaks of streptocyanine dyes merocyanine dyes have

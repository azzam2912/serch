in euclidean geometry homotheties are the similarities that fix a point and either preserve if or reverse if the direction of all vectors together with the translations all homotheties of an affine or euclidean space form a group the group of dilations or homothety translations these are precisely the affine transformations with the property that the image of every line l is a line parallel to l in projective geometry a homothetic transformation is a similarity transformation i e fixes a given elliptic involution that leaves the line at infinity pointwise invariant in euclidean geometry a homothety of ratio multiplies distances between points by and all areas by here is the ratio of magnification or dilation factor or scale factor or similitude ratio such a transformation can be called an enlargement if the scale factor exceeds 1 the above mentioned fixed point s is called homothetic center or center of similarity or center of similitude the term coined by french mathematician michel chasles is derived from two greek elements the prefix homo meaning similar and thesis meaning position it describes the relationship between two figures of the same shape and orientation for example two russian dolls looking in the same

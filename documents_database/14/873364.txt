dyspnea and hypoxemia are worse in the upright position which is called platypnea and orthodeoxia respectively the hepatopulmonary syndrome results from the formation of microscopic intrapulmonary arteriovenous dilatations in patients with both chronic and far less common acute liver failure the mechanism is unknown but is thought to be due to increased liver production or decreased liver clearance of vasodilators possibly involving nitric oxide the dilation of these blood vessels causes overperfusion relative to ventilation leading to ventilation perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia there is an increased gradient between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli of the lung and adjacent arteries alveolar arterial a a gradient while breathing room air patients with hps have platypnea orthodeoxia syndrome pos that is because intrapulmonary vascular dilations ipvds predominate in the bases of the lungs standing worsens hypoxemia orthodeoxia dyspnea platypnea and the supine position improves oxygenation as blood is redistributed from the bases to the apices additionally late in cirrhosis it is common to develop high output failure which would lead to less time in capillaries per red blood cell exacerbating the hypoxemia the hepatopulmonary syndrome is suspected in any patient with known liver disease who reports dyspnea particularly platypnea patients

a structure m is o minimal if and only if every formula with one free variable and parameters in m is equivalent to a quantifier free formula involving only the ordering also with parameters in m this is analogous to the minimal structures which are exactly the analogous property down to equality a theory t is an o minimal theory if every model of t is o minimal it is known that the complete theory t of an o minimal structure is an o minimal theory this result is remarkable because in contrast the complete theory of a minimal structure need not be a strongly minimal theory that is there may be an elementarily equivalent structure which is not minimal o minimal structures can be defined without recourse to model theory here we define a structure on a nonempty set m in a set theoretic manner as a sequence s s n 0 1 2 such that if m has a dense linear order without endpoints on it say semialgebraic sets thus the study of o minimal structures and theories generalises real algebraic geometry a major line of current research is based on discovering expansions of the real ordered field

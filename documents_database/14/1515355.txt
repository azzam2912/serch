this compound is also found in beer and belongs to a class of compounds that contribute to the bitterness and flavor of hops xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid biosynthesized by a type iii polyketide synthase pks and subsequent modifying enzymes xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid derived from a plant type iii pks and is synthesized in the glandular trichromes of hop cones l phenylalanine serves as the starting material which is converted to cinnamic acid by the plp dependent phenylalanine ammonia lyase cinnamic acid is oxidized by cinnamate 4 hydroxylase and loaded onto coenzyme a coa by 4 coumarate coa ligase to yield 4 hydroxy cinnamoyl coa the starter unit for pks extension this molecule is extended three times with malonyl coa cyclized through a claisen condensation and aromatized through tautomerization to form naringenin chalcone chalconaringenin this intermediate has the potential to form a variety of different products depending on the enzymes that modify the core structure in the case of xanthohumol a prenyltransferase called humulus lupulus prenyltransferase 1 hlpt 1 attaches a molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate from the dxp pathway hlpt 1 has a broad substrate specificity and also participates in making other prenylated flavonoids in the hop plant

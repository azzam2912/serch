the class group is a measure of the extent to which unique factorization fails in the ring of integers of the order of the group which is finite is called the class number of the theory extends to dedekind domains and their field of fractions for which the multiplicative properties are intimately tied to the structure of the class group for example the class group of a dedekind domain is trivial if and only if the ring is a unique factorization domain ideal class groups or rather what were effectively ideal class groups were studied some time before the idea of an ideal was formulated these groups appeared in the theory of quadratic forms in the case of binary integral quadratic forms as put into something like a final form by gauss a composition law was defined on certain equivalence classes of forms this gave a finite abelian group as was recognised at the time later kummer was working towards a theory of cyclotomic fields it had been realised probably by several people that failure to complete proofs in the general case of fermat s last theorem by factorisation using the roots of unity was for a very good reason

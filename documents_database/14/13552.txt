it forms ions and salts known as urates and acid urates such as ammonium acid urate uric acid is a product of the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides and it is a normal component of urine high blood concentrations of uric acid can lead to gout and are associated with other medical conditions including diabetes and the formation of ammonium acid urate kidney stones uric acid was first isolated from kidney stones in 1776 by the swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele in 1882 the ukrainian chemist ivan horbaczewski first synthesized uric acid by melting urea with glycine uric acid displays lactam lactim tautomerism also often described as keto enol tautomerism although the lactim form is expected to possess some degree of aromaticity uric acid crystallizes in the lactam form with computational chemistry also indicating that tautomer to be the most stable uric acid is a diprotic acid with p k 5 4 and p k 10 3 thus at physiological ph it predominately exists as the monoionic urate ion in general the water solubility of uric acid and its alkali metal and alkaline earth salts is rather low all these salts exhibit greater solubility in hot water than cold allowing

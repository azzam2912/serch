this is one of many state equations that have been used in earth sciences and shock physics to model the behavior of matter under conditions of high pressure it owes its name to francis d murnaghan who proposed it in 1944 to reflect material behavior under a pressure range as wide as possible to reflect an experimentally established fact the more a solid is compressed the more difficult it is to compress further the murnaghan equation is derived under certain assumptions from the equations of continuum mechanics it involves two adjustable parameters the modulus of incompressibility k and its first derivative with respect to the pressure k both measured at ambient pressure in general these coefficients are determined by a regression on experimentally obtained values of volume v as a function of the pressure p these experimental data can be obtained by x ray diffraction or by shock tests regression can also be performed on the values of the energy as a function of the volume obtained from ab initio and molecular dynamics calculations the murnaghan equation of state is typically expressed as if the reduction in volume under compression is low i e for v v greater than about

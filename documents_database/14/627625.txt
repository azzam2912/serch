degree at lewis and clark college in 1952 and his m a degree at the university of oregon in 1954 he received his ph d degree at the university of oregon in 1956 jefimenko worked for the development of the theory of electromagnetic retardation and relativity in 1956 he was awarded the sigma xi prize in 1971 and 1973 he won awards in the aapt apparatus competition jefimenko constructed and operated electrostatic generators run by atmospheric electricity jefimenko worked on the generalization of newton s gravitational theory to time dependent systems in his opinion there is no objective reason for abandoning newton s force field gravitational theory in favor of a metric gravitational theory he was trying to develop and expand newton s theory making it compatible with the principle of causality and making it applicable to time dependent gravitational interactions jefimenko s expansion or generalization is based on the existence of the second gravitational force field the cogravitational or heaviside s field this might also be called a gravimagnetic field it represents a physical approach profoundly different from the time space geometry approach of the einstein general theory of relativity oliver heaviside first predicted this field in the article

extending the principles of delastelle s earlier bifid cipher it combines the techniques of fractionation and transposition to achieve a certain amount of confusion and diffusion each letter of the ciphertext depends on three letters of the plaintext and up to three letters of the key the trifid cipher uses a table to fractionate each plaintext letter into a trigram mixes the constituents of the trigrams and then applies the table in reverse to turn these mixed trigrams into ciphertext letters delastelle notes that the most practical system uses three symbols for the trigrams in order to split letters into three parts it is necessary to represent them by a group of three signs or numbers knowing that n objects combined in trigrams in all possible ways give n n n n we recognize that three is the only value for n two would only give 2 8 trigrams while four would give 4 64 but three give 3 27 as discussed above the cipher requires a 27 letter mixed alphabet we follow delastelle by using a plus sign as the 27th letter a traditional method for constructing a mixed alphabet from a key word or phrase is to write

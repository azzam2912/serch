the conversion can be caused by enzymatic metabolism in the organisms as well as by abiotic chemical reactions while the parent drug are usually less active both the parent drug and its metabolite can be chemically active and cause toxicity leading to mutagenesis teratogenesis and carcinogenesis different classes of enzymes such as p450 monooxygenases epoxide hydrolase or acetyltransferases can catalyze the process in the cell mostly in the liver parent non toxic chemicals are generally referred to as protoxins while toxication is generally undesirable in certain cases it is required for the in vivo conversion of a prodrug to a metabolite with desired pharmacological or toxicological activity codeine is an example of a prodrug which is metabolized in the body to the opiate known as morphine phase i of drug metabolism are bioactivation pathways which are catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes produce toxic metabolites and thus have the potential to damage cells the unusual level of activity cyp450 enzymes might lead to the changes in drug metabolism and convert drugs into their more toxic forms among phase i cyp450 enzymes the subfamilies cyp2d6 and cyp3a are responsible for hepatotoxicity during drug metabolism with a number of different drugs including flucloxacilin trioleandomycin

in this method of switching individual elements pixels each pixel is attached to a transistor and capacitor actively maintaining the pixel state while other pixels are being addressed in contrast with the older passive matrix technology in which each pixel must maintain its state passively without being driven by circuitry active matrix technology was invented by bernard j lechner at rca using mosfets metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors active matrix technology was first demonstrated as a feasible device using thin film transistors tfts by t peter brody fang chen luo and their team at the thin film devices department of westinghouse electric corporation in 1974 and the term was introduced into the literature in 1975 given an m n matrix the number of connectors needed to address the display is m n just like in passive matrix technology each pixel is attached to a switch device which actively maintains the pixel state while other pixels are being addressed also preventing crosstalk from inadvertently changing the state of an unaddressed pixel the most common switching devices use tfts i e a fet based on either the cheaper non crystalline thin film silicon a si polycrystalline silicon poly si or cdse

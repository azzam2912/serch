meshes are created by computer algorithms often with human guidance through a gui depending on the complexity of the domain and the type of mesh desired the goal is to create a mesh that accurately captures the input domain geometry with high quality well shaped cells and without so many cells as to make subsequent calculations intractable the mesh should also be fine have small elements in areas that are important for the subsequent calculations meshes are used for rendering to a computer screen and for physical simulation such as finite element analysis or computational fluid dynamics meshes are composed of simple cells like triangles because e g we know how to perform operations such as finite element calculations engineering or ray tracing computer graphics on triangles but we do not know how to perform these operations directly on complicated spaces and shapes such as a roadway bridge we can simulate the strength of the bridge or draw it on a computer screen by performing calculations on each triangle and calculating the interactions between triangles a major distinction is between structured and unstructured meshing in structured meshing the mesh is a regular lattice such as an array with implied connectivity

jute was an effective joint sealant when the pipes carried coal based town gas but natural gas used since the 1950s in new york and the 1970s in the uk dries out the jute a fifty year life expectancy of the new seal has been proven in studies by cornell university cisbot is in diameter is long weighs and is deployed with a truck containing the control unit which is attached to the robot with a tether for the power communication and control cables as well as sealant tubing it is capable of repairing pipe cisbot is introduced into a pipeline through a hole and can repair the joints with an anaerobic sealant for a distance of while the pipe is still in operation external repair without the robot would require the arranging of temporary gas supply to customers through tanks purging the pipeline of gas then digging up each joint usually every repairing the joint and re covering the pipeline the cost of internal robotic repair is approximately 25 of manual resealing and 10 of total pipeline replacement the robot was developed by ulc robotics of hauppauge new york with cooperation from con edison and national grid and costs

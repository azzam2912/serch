it is approximately 10 km long and is estimated to be in depth the lake is named after the american explorer lincoln ellsworth the surface of the lake itself is located over below sea level lake ellsworth was discovered in 1996 by british scientist professor martin siegert of the university of bristol it is one of 387 known subglacial antarctic lakes and it is a target site for exploration due to the speculation that new forms of microbial life could have evolved in the unique habitats of antarctica s sub glacial lakes after half a million years of isolation life in subglacial lakes would have to adapt to total darkness low nutrient levels high water pressure and isolation from the atmosphere subglacial lakes thus represent unique biological habitats the lake remains liquid deep below the antarctic surface because the pressure exerted by thousands of meters of ice drives down the freezing point of water on 2 march 2009 the uk s natural environment research council authorized a team of british scientists to drill through the overlaying ice to the surface of the lake in december 2012 the drilling was to be overseen by the scientific committee on antarctic research from

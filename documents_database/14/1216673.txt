let formula 1 formula 2 formula 3 be integers a code formula 4 over an alphabet q of size q q is called q ary r covering code of length n if for every word formula 5 there is a codeword formula 6 such that the hamming distance formula 7 in other words the spheres or balls or rook domains of radius r with respect to the hamming metric around the codewords of c have to exhaust the metric space formula 8 the covering radius of a code c is the smallest r such that c is r covering every perfect code is a covering code of minimal size c 0134 0223 1402 1431 1444 2123 2234 3002 3310 4010 4341 is a 5 ary 2 covering code of length 4 the determination of the minimal size formula 9 of a q ary r covering code of length n is a very hard problem in many cases only upper and lower bounds are known with a large gap between them every construction of a covering code gives an upper bound on k n r lower bounds include the sphere covering bound and rodemich s bounds formula 10 and formula 11

it runs in formula 1 time in the worst case where formula 2 is set of edges in the graph formula 3 is set of vertices of the graph and it is assumed that formula 4 in the case of dense graphs the time bound becomes formula 5 and for sparse random graphs it runs in near linear in e time the algorithm was found by and independently by as in previous methods for matching such as the hungarian algorithm and the work of the hopcroft karp algorithm repeatedly increases the size of a partial matching by finding augmenting paths sequences of edges that alternate between being in and out of the matching such that swapping which edges of the path are in and which are out of the matching produces a larger matching however instead of finding just a single augmenting path per iteration the algorithm finds a maximal set of shortest augmenting paths as a result only formula 6 iterations are needed the same principle has also been used to develop more complicated algorithms for non bipartite matching with the same asymptotic running time as the hopcroft karp algorithm a vertex that is not the endpoint of an

it is an unstable colorless liquid which can be produced by mixing formic acid with hydrogen peroxide owing to its oxidizing and disinfecting action it is used in the chemical medical and food industries performic acid is a colorless liquid soluble in water alcohols ether benzene chloroform and other organic solvents its strong oxidizing properties are used for cleaving disulfide bonds in protein mapping as well as for epoxidation hydroxylation and oxidation reactions in organic synthesis in the medical and food industries performic acid is commonly used to disinfect equipment it is effective against viruses bacterial spores algae microscopic fungi and mycobacteria as well as other microorganisms such as zooplankton the popularity of performic acid as a sterilizer originates from the safe nature of its degradation products mostly carbon dioxide oxygen and water the disinfecting action of performic acid is also faster than that of the related compounds peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide the major drawbacks of performic acid are handling dangers related to its high reactivity as well as instability especially upon heating which means that the acid must be used within about 12 hours of it being synthesised performic acid is synthesized by the reaction of formic acid

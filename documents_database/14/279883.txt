if a conductive hearing loss occurs in conjunction with a sensorineural hearing loss it is referred to as a mixed hearing loss depending upon the severity and nature of the conductive loss this type of hearing impairment can often be treated with surgical intervention or pharmaceuticals to partially or in some cases fully restore hearing acuity to within normal range however cases of permanent or chronic conductive hearing loss may require other treatment modalities such as hearing aid devices to improve detection of sound and speech perception common causes of conductive hearing loss include fluid accumulation is the most common cause of conductive hearing loss in the middle ear especially in children major causes are ear infections or conditions that block the eustachian tube such as allergies or tumors blocking of the eustachian tube leads to decreased pressure in the middle ear relative to the external ear and this causes decreased motion of both the ossicles and the tympanic membrane third window effect caused by conductive hearing loss makes all sounds seem faint or muffled the hearing loss is usually worse in lower frequencies congenital conductive hearing loss is identified through newborn hearing screening or may be identified because the

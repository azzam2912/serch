under these conditions the droplet will periodically deform between prolate and oblate ellipsoidal shapes the characteristic frequency and magnitude of the deformation is determined by a balance of electrodynamic hydrodynamic and capillary stresses acting on the droplet interface this phenomenon has been studied extensively both mathematically and experimentally because of the complex fluid dynamics that occur characterization and modulation of electrodynamic droplet deformation is of particular interest for engineering applications because of the growing need to improve the performance of complex industrial processes e g two phase cooling crude oil demulsification the primary advantage of using oscillatory droplet deformation to improve these engineering processes is that the phenomenon does not require sophisticated machinery or the introduction of heat sources this effectively means that improving performance via oscillatory droplet deformation is simple and in no way diminishes the effectiveness of the existing engineering system the heat transfer dynamics in two phase two component flow systems are governed by the dynamic behavior of droplets bubbles that are injected into the circulating coolant stream the injected bubbles droplets are typically of a lower density than the coolant and thus experience an upward buoyancy force they enhance the thermal performance of cooling systems because

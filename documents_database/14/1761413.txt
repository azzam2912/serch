in the electrostatic multipole expansion all charge and current distributions can be expanded into a complete set of electric and magnetic multipole coefficients however additional terms arise in an electrodynamic multipole expansion the coefficients of these terms are given by the toroidal multipole moments as well as time derivatives of the electric and magnetic multipole moments while electric dipoles can be understood as separated charges and magnetic dipoles as circular currents axial or electric toroidal dipoles describes toroidal charge arrangements whereas polar or magnetic toroidal dipole also called anapole correspond to the field of a solenoid bent into a torus a complicated expression allows the current density j to be written as a sum of electric magnetic and toroidal moments using cartesian or spherical differential operators the lowest order toroidal term is the toroidal dipole its magnitude along direction i is given by since this term arises only in an expansion of the current density to second order it generally vanishes in a long wavelength approximation however a recent study comes to the result that the toroidal multipole moments are not a separate multipole family but rather higher order terms of the electric multipole moments in 1957 yakov zel dovich

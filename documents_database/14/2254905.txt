it was developed by the dutch scientist andries rinse miedema 15 november 1933 28 may 1992 while working at philips research laboratories philips natuurkundig laboratorium it may provide or confirm basic enthalpy data that have always been needed for the calculation of phase diagrams of metals and that are now currently approached by calphad the method has been introduced by miedema in a couple of papers appeared in 1973 in philips technical review magazine entitled a simple model for alloys while miedema himself or with collaborators produced many scientific papers we report here in his own words the genuine motivation of his approach reliable rules for the alloying behaviour of metals have long been sought there is the qualitative rule that states that the greater the difference in the electronegativity of two metals the greater the heat of formation and hence the stability then there is the hume rothery rule which states that two metals that differ by more than 15 in their atomic radius will not form substitutional solid solutions this rule can only be used reliably 90 success to predict poor solubility it cannot predict good solubility the author has proposed a simple atomic model which is empirical

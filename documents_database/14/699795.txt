he was the son of the botanist david thoday he was arthur balfour professor of genetics at cambridge university between 1959 and 1983 and was elected a fellow of the royal society in 1965 thoday was born in chinley derbyshire and educated at bootham school york followed by university college of north wales at bangor and then trinity college cambridge during world war ii he served in the raf as a photographic intelligence officer his research from 1947 has been largely concerned with the causes and functions of intraspecific genetic variation on the nature of continuous genetic variation and on the effects of selection on such variation he has published an important thesis on the meaning of biological progress in evolution and the role of genetic variation in determining long term fitness he has pioneered a method for the location on chromosomes of genes mediating continuous variation and showed contrary to accepted theory that the genes at different loci affected the quantitative character in qualitatively different ways he has pioneered experiments into disruptive selection selection in the same population for both extremes and against intermediates and again contrary to theoretical expectation showed such selection could be extremely effective increasing variance

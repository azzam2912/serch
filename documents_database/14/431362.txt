in its original formation these are drama simulation and game it was the inspiration for subsequent theories such as the gns theory which retained a 3 way division but altered other aspects of the model in its most formal sense the threefold model claims that any single gamemaster gm decision about the resolution of in game events can be made in order to further the goals of drama or simulation or game by extension a series of decisions may be described as tending towards one or two of the three goals to a greater or lesser extent this can be visualised as an equilateral triangle with a goal at each vertex and the points between them representing different weightings of the different goals as a consequence a player or gm can characterise their preferred gaming style as a point on this triangle or since no real precision is implied in words such as mostly gamist or dramatist with a bit of simulationist or right in the middle another consequence of the model is the claim that by advancing towards one of the goals one is moving away from the other two thus a game that is highly dramatic will be

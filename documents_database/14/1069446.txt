it is made by a wit technologies inc and has become quite popular with students and electronics hobbyists since june 2006 due to its low threshold of learning ease of use capabilities and its low price although the c stamp has the form of a dip chip it is in fact a small printed circuit board that contains the essential elements of a microprocessor system the c stamp is programmed using wc wc is a microcontroller friendly c based infrastructure created by a wit technologies inc when starting a wc file the programmer needs to insert the c stamp header file as indicated below the wc software infrastructure incorporates common microcontroller functions including pwm serial communications i c communication communications with common lcd circuits hobby servo pulse trains pseudo sine wave frequencies and digital to analog conversions the end result is that a hobbyist can connect a 9v battery to a c stamp and have a complete system a connection to a pc allows the programmer to download software to the c stamp which is stored in the onchip memory this memory stays programmed until it is erased and reprogrammed the memory remains intact even when the power is removed

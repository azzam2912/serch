a major problem of cancer immunotherapy is the selection of tumor cell variants that escape immune recognition the notion of oncoantigen was set forth in the context of cancer immunoprevention to define a class of persistent tumor antigens not prone to escape from immune recognition localization of oncoantigens outside tumor cells allows recognition by antibodies if downregulation of class i major histocompatibility complex mhc i molecules prevents t cell recognition most tumor antigens are intracellular proteins circulating antibodies do not penetrate inside cells hence intracellular proteins are only recognized by t cells as mhc i bound antigenic peptides exposed on the surface of tumor cells however downmodulation or complete loss of mhc i expression occurs in most human tumors making them altogether invisible to the immune system of the host when tumor cells downregulate mhc i only antigens expressed on the cell surface and or secreted in the extracellular fluids can be recognized by antibodies loss of oncoantigen expression is unlikely because oncoantigens support tumor growth loss of tumor antigen expression is another cause of escape from immune recognition this occurs because most tumor antigens are not essential for tumor growth hence loss of expression does not decrease the fitness

this is usually done for pathways whose products may be needed in different amounts at different times such as hormone production regulatory enzymes exist at high concentrations low vmax so their activity can be increased or decreased with changes in substrate concentrations the enzymes which catalyse chemical reactions again and again are called regulatory enzymes generally it is considered that a hyperbolic structured protein in specific media conditions is ready to do its task it is active but some specific deactivation are responsible for the regulation of some metabolism pathways regulatory enzymes are commonly the first enzyme in a multienzyme system the product of the reaction catalyzed by the first enzyme is the substrate of the second enzyme so the cell can control the amount of resulting product by regulating the activity of the first enzyme of the pathway there are many strategies of activation and deactivation of regulatory enzymes regulatory enzymes require an extra activation process and need to pass through some modifications in their 3d in order to become functional for instance catalyzing enzymes regulatory enzymes the regulation of the activation of these catalyzing enzymes is needed in order to regulate the whole reaction speed so that it

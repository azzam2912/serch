the fault is divided into five segments in three zones which rupture separately or in combination and depending on location the resulting earthquakes are subdivided by zone from west to east into nankai earthquakes t nankai earthquakes and t kai earthquakes the earthquakes occur with a return period of about 90 200 years and often occur in pairs where a rupture along part of the fault is followed by a rupture elsewhere notably the 1854 ansei t kai earthquake and the 1854 ansei nankai earthquake the next day and the 1944 t nankai earthquake followed by the 1946 nankaid earthquake in one recorded case the 1707 h ei earthquake the fault ruptured along its entire length all of these great earthquakes have resulted in damaging tsunamis which are particularly damaging due to the japanese population being concentrated on the taiheiy belt especially the coastal cities of tokyo and osaka the two most populous in japan the area remains seismically active and future earthquakes are anticipated with a high risk of a nankai earthquake in the near future which could be potentially very damaging the nankai trough is the surface expression of the subduction zone between the philippine sea and amur

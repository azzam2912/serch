the engine sits just forward of the transom while the drive unit outdrive or drive leg lies outside the hull the drive unit outdrive carries power from the inboard engine typically mounted above the waterline outboard through the transom and downward to the propeller below the waterline the outdrive resembles the bottom half of an outboard motor and is composed of two sub units an upper containing a driveshaft connected through the transom to an engine which transmits power to a 90 degree angle gearbox and the lower containing a vertical driveshaft receiving power from the upper unit gearbox transmitted through another 90 degree angle gearbox to the propeller shaft the boat is steered by pivoting the outdrive as on an outboard motor no rudder is needed the outdrive is pivoted up for trailer travel and between uses to avoid fouling the outdrive can be matched with a variety of engines in the appropriate power range upper and lower units can often be purchased separately to customize gear ratios and propeller rpm and lower units are also available with counter rotating gearing to provide balanced torque in dual drive installations sterndrive engines are similar to those used in true inboard

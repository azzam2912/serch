it was jointly owned and operated by manchester and liverpool universities and used for performing neutron activation work and training reactor operators the reactor used highly enriched uranium metal fuel clad in aluminium the fuel elements consisted of bundles of flat plates rather than rods the core was cooled by light water the fuel elements were situated within six open topped aluminium tanks containing water that were separated and surrounded by graphite this meant that moderation was part by the water within the tanks and part by graphite with graphite serving as the reflector reactivity control was provided by four semaphore signal type control blades held by magnetic clutches to shafts that could be driven by geared electric motors the blades were made of cadmium plates rivetted to aluminium blades the insertion of a single blade was sufficient to shut down the fission chain reaction the simple control system did not use voting logic any detected fault resulted in an immediate scram power failure also produced an immediate scram as the magnetic clutches on the control blades would disengage certain control instrumentation had battery back up support the heat generated by fission was carried away by the cooling water and

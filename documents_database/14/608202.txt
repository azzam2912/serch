the carbon carbon bond in a vicinal diol glycol is cleaved and instead the two oxygen atoms become double bonded to their respective carbon atoms depending on the substitution pattern in the diol these carbonyls can be either ketones or aldehydes glycol cleavage is an important reaction in the laboratory because it is useful for determining the structures of sugars after cleavage takes place the ketone and aldehyde fragments can be inspected and the location of the former hydroxyl groups ascertained periodic acid hio and lead tetraacetate pb oac are the most common reagents used for glycol cleavage processes called the malaprade reaction and criegee oxidation respectively these reactions are most efficient when a cyclic intermediate can form with the iodine or lead atom linking both oxygen atoms the ring then fragments with breakage of the carbon carbon bond and formation of carbonyl groups if an r group is a hydrogen atom an aldehyde is formed at that site if the r group is a chain that begins with a carbon atom a ketone is formed warm concentrated potassium permanganate kmno will react with an alkene to form a glycol following this dihydroxylation the kmno can then easily cleave the

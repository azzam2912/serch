these functions are called the schwinger functions named after julian schwinger and they are analytic symmetric under the permutation of arguments antisymmetric for fermionic fields euclidean covariant and satisfy a property known as reflection positivity pick any arbitrary coordinate and pick a test function f with n points as its arguments assume f has its support in the time ordered subset of n points with 0 hyperplane then where represents complex conjugation the osterwalder schrader theorem named after konrad osterwalder and robert schrader states that schwinger functions which satisfy these properties can be analytically continued into a quantum field theory one way of formally constructing schwinger functions which satisfy the above properties is through the euclidean path integral in particular euclidean path integrals formally satisfy reflection positivity let f be any polynomial functional of the field which does not depend upon the value of x for those points x whose coordinates are nonpositive then since the action s is real and can be split into s which only depends on on the positive half space and s which only depends upon on the negative half space and if s also happens to be invariant under the combined action of taking

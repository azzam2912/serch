the signs are low arterial blood pressure distended neck veins and distant muffled heart sounds narrowed pulse pressure might also be observed the concept was developed by claude beck a resident and later professor of cardiovascular surgery at case western reserve university the fall in arterial blood pressure results from pericardial fluid accumulation increasing pressure on the outside of the heart that limits the maximum size the ventricles can stretch to this limits diastolic expansion filling which results in a lower edv end diastolic volume which reduces stroke volume a major determinant of systolic blood pressure this is in accordance with the frank starling law of the heart which explains that as the ventricles fill with larger volumes of blood they stretch further and their contractile force increases thus causing a related increase in systolic blood pressure the rising central venous pressure is evidenced by distended jugular veins while in a non supine position it is caused by reduced diastolic filling of the right ventricle due to pressure from the adjacent expanding pericardial sac this results in a backup of fluid into the veins draining into the heart most notably the jugular veins in severe hypovolemia the neck veins may

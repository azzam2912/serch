in modern agricultural practices there are methods of managing under 1 grain loss but small subsistence farms can see 20 100 of grain loss this causes starvation and an unstable food supply grain loss can be caused by mold growth bugs birds or any other contamination one method of preventing loss is hermetic grain storage hermetic grain storage strives to eliminate all exchange of gases within the storage system this mitigates bacterial activity and prevents rodents and bugs from being able to breathe inside the storage systems the introduction of hermetic grain storage to subsistence farms can create a more stable food supply in the area and reduce the risk of starvation hermetic storage is the process of storing grain or seeds inside sealed compartments to avoid gas changes with the environment in order to deplete the oxygen and accumulation of dioxide carbon gas this combination is lethal to insects and molds creating an alternative control instead of using any other substance nocive to these pests and maintaining the product quality this storage method is an important aspect for enhancing and elongating grain life at the same time maintaining the grain integrity hermetic storage has been around for a long

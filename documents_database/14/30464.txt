following a successful launch the spacecraft failed to perform a course correction and as a result it missed the moon remaining instead in earth orbit luna 4 was launched by a molniya l carrier rocket at 08 16 37 utc on 2 april 1963 launch occurred from site 1 5 at the baikonur cosmodrome after reaching an initial parking orbit of the rocket s upper stage restarted to place luna 4 onto a translunar trajectory the spacecraft did not perform a required midcourse correction manoeuvre which resulted in it missing the moon by at 13 25 ut on april 5 1963 it then entered a barycentric 90 000 700 000 km earth orbit a lecture program entitled hitting the moon was scheduled to be broadcast on radio moscow at 7 45 p m the evening of april 5 but was cancelled the spacecraft transmitted at 183 6 mhz at least until april 6 the purpose of this experiment was to obtain information on the characteristics of the lunar surface these characteristics included the amount of cratering structure and size of craters the amount distribution and sizes of ejecta mechanical properties of the surface such as bearing strength cohesiveness compaction etc

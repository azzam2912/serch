although similar in temperature to the sun it is 20 brighter 3 7 more massive and 11 larger alongside this the star is approximately six billion years old and possesses a high metallicity thus kepler 452 can be considered a solar twin although it could considered to be a solar analog due to its age prior to kepler observation kepler 452 had the 2mass catalogue number 2mass 19440088 4416392 in the kepler input catalog it has the designation of kic 8311864 when it was found to have a transiting planet candidate it was given the kepler object of interest number of koi 7016 planetary candidates were detected around the star by nasa s kepler mission a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars the transit method that kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness of stars these dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits pass in front of their stars from the perspective of earth although other phenomena can also be responsible which is why the term planetary candidate is used following the acceptance of the discovery paper the kepler team referred to the star as kepler 452 which is the normal procedure for

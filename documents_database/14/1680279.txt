one highlight is the mounting of the lens on a lens board running on a rail connecting lens and camera body by a bellows like a view camera in contrast to related medium format cameras of other makers e g mamiya rb67 and rz67 and rolleiflex sl66 the lens board can be shifted right left up and down for perspective control the lens board can also be tilted on horizontal and vertical axis for control of depth of field using the scheimpflug principle therefore the fuji gx680 has the optical skills of a large format camera only limited by restricted movability of the lens board enabling the camera also for architectural photography the fuji gx680 has quite large physical dimensions for a medium format camera but compared to studio large format cameras the fuji gx680 is a somewhat more compact model although the fuji gx680 was designed for studio work due to its size and weight a neck strap was offered for mobile work the fuji gx 680 has been built in 3 model variants numbers in parentheses are the production periods the 3 models differ externally only by slight modifications on displays controls and rechargeable battery versus battery there

the frequency shift or phase shift of an incident laser beam depends on the dispersed particles mobility in the case of dynamic light scattering brownian motion causes particle motion in the case of electrophoretic light scattering oscillating electric field performs the same function this method is used for measuring electrophoretic mobility and then calculating zeta potential instruments to apply the method are commercially available from several manufacturers the last set of calculations requires information on viscosity and dielectric permittivity of the dispersion medium appropriate electrophoresis theory is also required sample dilution is often necessary in order to eliminate multiple scattering of the incident laser beam and or particle interactions a laser beam passes through the electrophoresis cell irradiates the particles dispersed in it and is scattered by the particles the scattered light is detected by a photo multiplier after passing through two pinholes there are two types of optical systems heterodyne and fringe ware and flygare developed a heterodyne type els instrument that was the first instrument of this type in a fringe optics els instrument a laser beam is divided into two beams those cross inside the electrophresis cell at a fixed angle to produce a fringe pattern the

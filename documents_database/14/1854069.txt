each bottle is a volume that range from a minimum value of 1 2 l to a maximum value of 30 l all of them constitutes the rosette sampler and are clustered around a cylinder situated in the center of the assembly where there is a sensing system called sea bird or ctd that stands for conductivity temperature and depth although other variables can be measured by modern ctds e g water turbidity dissolved oxygen concentration chlorophyll concentration and ph the apparatus is attached to a wire rope a winch on board of the boat unroll the rope during descent and roll up it during the ascent i e at the end of the samples collection during operations in the ocean a rosette sampler can approach the seabed at a distance from 1 to 5 m depending on the particular sea conditions the opening of each sampling bottle can be automatic by reaching a certain depth or manual by operator remotely water sampling is used in general for chemical analysis and ecotoxicological assessment a rosette sampler is preferred to winchester sampler for collection of water sampling at depths greater than 50 m

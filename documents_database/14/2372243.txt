on these via c3 processors the second hidden processor mode is accessed by executing the x86 instruction codice 1 if ais mode has been enabled the processor will perform a jmp eax and begin executing ais instructions at the address of the eax register using ais allows native access to the centaur technology designed risc core inside the processor the manufacter describes the alternate instruction set as an extended set of integer mmx floating point and 3dnow instructions along with additional registers and some more powerful instruction forms every ais instruction is prefixed with the 3 byte sequence codice 2 followed by the 32 bit instruction this prefix form for the ais instructions makes them appear to be x86 load effective address codice 3 instructions in 2018 researcher christoper domas reported that the prefix codice 4 x86 codice 5 also worked a proposal made in 2002 to add ais support to the netwide assembler nasm was partially declined in 2005 on the basis that nasm was an x86 assember and ais is a separate instruction set in 2007 a patent named some microcode instructions as codice 6 and codice 7 to from main ram and codice 8 and codice 9

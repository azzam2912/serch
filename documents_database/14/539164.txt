once air becomes saturated water will condense out to form clouds dew or films of water over leaves it is this last instance that makes vpd important for greenhouse regulation if a film of water forms on a plant leaf it becomes far more susceptible to rot on the other hand as the vpd increases the plant needs to draw more water from its roots in the case of cuttings the plant may dry out and die for this reason the ideal range for vpd in a greenhouse is from 0 45 kpa to 1 25 kpa ideally sitting at around 0 85 kpa as a general rule most plants grow well at vpds of between 0 8 and 0 95 kpa in ecology it is the difference between the actual water vapour pressure and the saturation water vapour pressure at a particular temperature unlike relative humidity vapour pressure deficit has a simple nearly straight line relationship to the rate of evapotranspiration and other measures of evaporation to compute the vpd we need the ambient greenhouse air temperature the relative humidity and if possible the canopy air temperature we must then compute the saturation pressure saturation pressure can be looked

the signature of b chi arithmetic contains only the addition operation formula 2 and equality omitting the multiplication operation entirely unlike peano arithmetic b chi arithmetic is a decidable theory this means it is possible to effectively determine for any sentence in the language of b chi arithmetic whether that sentence is provable from the axioms of b chi arithmetic a subset formula 3 is definable in b chi arithmetic of base k if and only if it is k recognisable if formula 4 this means that the set of integers of x in base k is accepted by an automaton similarly if formula 5 there exists an automaton that reads the first digits then the second digits and so on of n integers in base k and accepts the words if the n integers are in the relation x if k and l are multiplicatively dependent then the b chi arithmetics of base k and l have the same expressivity indeed formula 6 can be defined in formula 7 the first order theory of formula 2 and formula 9 otherwise an arithmetic theory with both formula 2 and formula 6 functions is equivalent to peano arithmetic which has both

the ge12 was designed and conceived by ge s art adamson and art adinolfi in 1967 both ge and pratt whitney were awarded contracts to work parallel with each other to design fabricate and test the technology the army effort led in the 1970s to development of the sikorsky s 70 black hawk powered by twin ge t700 turboshafts the production descendant of the ge12 the t700 was initially bench tested in 1973 passed military qualification in 1976 and went into production in 1978 the initial t700 ge 700 is an ungeared free turbine turboshaft with a five stage axial one stage centrifugal mixed flow compressor featuring one piece blisk axial stages with the inlet guide vanes and first two stator stages variable an annular combustion chamber with central fuel injection to improve combustion and reduce smoke a two stage compressor turbine and a two stage free power turbine with tip shrouded blades the engine is designed for high reliability featuring an inlet particle separator designed to spin out dirt sand and dust the t700 ge 700 is rated at 1 622 shp 1 210 kw intermediate power the t700 ge 700 was followed by improved and uprated army engine

each nuclear plant s emergency core cooling system eccs exists specifically to deal with a loca nuclear reactors generate heat internally to remove this heat and convert it into useful electrical power a coolant system is used if this coolant flow is reduced or lost altogether the nuclear reactor s emergency shutdown system is designed to stop the fission chain reaction however due to radioactive decay the nuclear fuel will continue to generate a significant amount of heat the decay heat produced by a reactor shutdown from full power is initially equivalent to about 5 to 6 of the thermal rating of the reactor if all of the independent cooling trains of the eccs fail to operate as designed this heat can increase the fuel temperature to the point of damaging the reactor under operating conditions a reactor may passively that is in the absence of any control systems increase or decrease its power output in the event of a loca or of voids appearing in its coolant system by water boiling for example this is measured by the coolant void coefficient most modern nuclear power plants have a negative void coefficient indicating that as water turns to steam power

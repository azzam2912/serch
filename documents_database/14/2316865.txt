common fullerides are derivatives of the most common fullerenes i e c and c the scope of the area is large because multiple charges are possible i e c n 1 2 6 and all fullerenes can be converted to fullerides the suffix ide implies their negatively charged nature fullerides can be isolated as derivatives with a wide range of cations most heavily studied derivatives are those with alkali metals but fullerides have been prepared with organic cations fullerides are typically dark colored solids that generally dissolve in polar organic solvents according to electronic structure calculations the lumo of c is a triply degenerate orbital of t symmetry using the technique cyclic voltammetry c can be shown to undergo six reversible reductions starting at 1 v referenced to the fc fc couple reduction causes only subtle changes in the structure and many derivatives exhibit disorder which obscures these effects many fullerides are subject to jahn teller distortion in certain cases e g ppn c the structures are highly ordered and slight 10 pm elongation of some c c bonds is observed fullerides have been prepared in various ways the fulleride salt k crypt 222 c salt is synthesized by treating

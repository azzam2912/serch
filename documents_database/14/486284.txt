it consists of all the components in the receiver that process the signal at the original incoming radio frequency rf before it is converted to a lower intermediate frequency if in microwave and satellite receivers it is often called the low noise block lnb or low noise downconverter lnd and is often located at the antenna so that the signal from the antenna can be transferred to the rest of the receiver at the more easily handled intermediate frequency for most superheterodyne architectures the rf front end consists of in digital receivers particularly those in wireless devices such as cell phones and wifi receivers the intermediate frequency is digitized sampled and converted to a binary digital form and the rest of the processing if filtering and demodulation is done by digital filters digital signal processing dsp as these are smaller use less power and can have more selectivity in this type of receiver the rf front end is defined as everything from the antenna to the analog to digital converter adc which digitizes the signal the general trend is to do as much of the signal processing in digital form as possible and some receivers digitize the rf signal directly

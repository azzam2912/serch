it belongs to the field of combinatorics on words it was conjectured in 1972 by fran oise dejean and proven in 2009 by currie and rampersad and independently by rao in the study of strings concatenation is seen as analogous to multiplication of numbers so for instance if formula 1 is any string then the concatenation formula 2 of two copies of formula 1 is called the square of formula 1 and denoted formula 5 this exponential notation may also be extended to fractional powers if formula 1 has length formula 7 and formula 8 is a non negative rational number of the form formula 9 then formula 10 denotes the string formed by the first formula 11 characters of the infinite repetition formula 12 a square free word is a string that does not contain any square as a substring in particular it avoids repeating the same symbol consecutively repeating the same pair of symbols etc axel thue showed that there exists an infinite square free word using a three symbol alphabet the sequence of differences between consecutive elements of the thue morse sequence however it is not possible for an infinite two symbol word or even a two

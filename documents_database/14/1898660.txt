the cation sits at the center of a trigonal prism nine fluorides are close three at the bottom corners of the trigonal prism three in the faces of the trigonal prism and three at top corners of the trigonal prism there are also two fluorides a little further away above and below the prism the cation can be considered 9 coordinate or 11 coordinate the larger sized rare earth elements lanthanides which are those with smaller atomic number also form trifluorides with the laf structure some actinides do as well lanthanum fluoride is sometimes used as the high index component in multilayer optical elements such as ultraviolet dichroic and narrowband mirrors fluorides are among the most commonly used compounds for uv optical coatings due to their relative inertness and transparency in the far ultraviolet fuv 100 nm index of refraction the other with a high index there are very few high index materials in the far uv laf3 is one the material is also a component of multimetal fluoride glasses such as zblan it is also used with europium trifluoride euf3 in fluoride selective electrodes

it contains an amino group which is in the protonated nh form under biological conditions a carboxyl group which is in the deprotonated coo form under biological conditions and a side chain containing a hydroxyl group making it a polar uncharged amino acid it is essential in humans meaning the body cannot synthesize it it must be obtained from the diet threonine is synthesized from aspartate in bacteria such as e coli it is encoded by all the codons starting ac act acc aca and acg threonine sidechains are often hydrogen bonded the most common small motifs formed are based on interactions with serine st turns st motifs often at the beginning of alpha helices and st staples usually at the middle of alpha helices the threonine residue is susceptible to numerous posttranslational modifications the hydroxyl side chain can undergo o linked glycosylation in addition threonine residues undergo phosphorylation through the action of a threonine kinase in its phosphorylated form it can be referred to as phosphothreonine phosphothreonine has three potential coordination sites carboxyl amine and phosphate group and determination of the mode of coordination between phosphorylated ligands and metal ions occurring in an organism is important to explain the

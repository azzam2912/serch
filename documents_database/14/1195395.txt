the idea is that if the propagation channels between each pair of transmit and receive antennas are statistically independent and identically distributed then multiple independent channels with identical characteristics can be created by precoding and be used for either transmitting multiple data streams or increasing the reliability in terms of bit error rate in practice the channels between different antennas are often correlated and therefore the potential multi antenna gains may not always be obtainable this is called spatial correlation as it can be interpreted as a correlation between a signal s spatial direction and the average received signal gain in an ideal communication scenario there is a line of sight path between the transmitter and receiver that represents clear spatial channel characteristics in urban cellular systems this is seldom the case as base stations are located on rooftops while many users are located either indoors or at streets far from base stations thus there is a non line of sight multipath propagation channel between base stations and users describing how the signal is reflected at different obstacles on its way from the transmitter to the receiver however the received signal may still have a strong spatial signature in the

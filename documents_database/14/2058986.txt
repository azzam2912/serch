zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal in other words only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists when a drop of liquid is placed on such a surface the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in fig 1 furthermore on an ideal surface the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed the following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium figure 3 shows the line of contact where three phases meet in equilibrium the net force per unit length acting along the boundary line between the three phases must be zero the components of net force in the direction along each of the interfaces are given by where and are the angles shown and is the surface energy between the two indicated phases these relations can also be expressed by an analog to a triangle known as neumann s triangle shown in figure 4 neumann s triangle is consistent with the geometrical restriction that formula 4 and applying the law of sines and law of cosines to it produce

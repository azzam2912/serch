unlike other triangle area formulae there is no need to calculate angles or other distances in the triangle first heron s formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths and is where is the semi perimeter of the triangle that is heron s formula can also be written as let be the triangle with sides and the semiperimeter is and the area is in this example the side lengths and area are all integers making it a heronian triangle however heron s formula works equally well in cases where one or all of these numbers is not an integer the formula is credited to heron or hero of alexandria and a proof can be found in his book metrica written ce 60 it has been suggested that archimedes knew the formula over two centuries earlier and since metrica is a collection of the mathematical knowledge available in the ancient world it is possible that the formula predates the reference given in that work a formula equivalent to heron s namely was discovered by the chinese independently of the greeks it was published in mathematical treatise in nine sections qin jiushao 1247 heron s original proof made

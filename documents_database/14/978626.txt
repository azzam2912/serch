krogmann published the original journal article documenting the synthesis and characterization of the salt in 1969 krogmann s salt is a series of partially oxidized tetracyanoplatinate complexes linked by the platinum platinum bonds on the top and bottom faces of the planar pt cn anions this salt forms infinite stacks in the solid state based on the overlap of the d orbitals krogmann s salt has a tetragonal crystal structure with a pt pt distance of 2 880 angstroms which is much shorter than the metal metal bond distances in other planar platinum complexes such as ca pt cn 5ho 3 36 angstroms sr pt cn 5ho 3 58 angstroms and mg pt cn 7ho 3 16 angstroms the pt pt distance in krogmann s salt is only 0 1 angstroms longer than in platinum metal each unit cell contains a site for cl corresponding to 0 5 cl per pt however this site is only filled 64 of the time giving 0 32 cl per pt in the actual compound because of this the oxidation number of pt does not rise above 2 32 krogmann s salt has no recognizable phase range and is characterized by broad and intense

it is a white odorless crystalline indefinitely storable solid which dissolves in water and many organic solvents the compound is used as a source of butadiene sulfolene is formed via a reversible cheletropic reaction between 1 3 butadiene and sulfur dioxide these compounds are first mixed in an autoclave at about 20 c with an excess of sulfur dioxide in the presence of small amounts of a phenolic polymerization inhibitor e g hydroquinone or pyrogallol and either allowed to stand at room temperature for days or heated to about 130 c for 30 minutes the compound is unaffected by acids it can even be recrystallized from conc hno the protons in the 2 and 5 positions rapidly exchange with deuterium oxide under alkaline conditions sodium cyanide catalyzes this reaction under basic conditions or when catalyzed by cyanide ions 3 sulfolene isomerizes to a mixture of 2 sulfolene and 3 sulfolene the ratio of 2 sulfolene and 3 sulfolene depends on the ratio of cyanide and sulfolene at 50 c an equilibrium mixture is obtained containing 42 3 sulfolene and 58 2 sulfolene the thermodynamically more stable 2 sulfolene can be isolated from the mixture of isomers as pure substance in

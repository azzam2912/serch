lamb of irish descent was the only non african american of the big three composers of classical ragtime the other two being scott joplin and james scott the ragtime of joseph lamb ranges from standard popular fare to complex and highly engaging his use of long phrases was influenced by classical works he had learned from his sister and others while growing up but his sense of structure was potentially derived from his study of joplin s piano rags by the time he added some polish to his later works in the 1950s lamb had mastered the classic rag genre in a way that almost no other composer was able to approach at that time and continued to play it passably as well as evidenced by at least two separate recordings done in his home as well as a few recorded interviews lamb was born in montclair new jersey the youngest of four children he taught himself to play the piano and admired the early ragtime publications of scott joplin he dropped out of st jerome s college in 1904 to work for a dry goods company he met joplin in 1907 while purchasing the latest joplin and scott sheet

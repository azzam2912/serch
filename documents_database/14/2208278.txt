it is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types mia3 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum er exit site where it binds bulky cargo molecules such as collagens and creates mega transport carriers for the export of cargoes from the er this function suggests that it plays a role in assembly of extracellular matrix ecm and bone formation mia3 has been demonstrated to contribute to both tumor suppression and progression the mia3 gene also contains one of 27 loci associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease a tango1 like protein called tali is expressed in liver and intestine and shown to be required for the export of bulky very low density lipoproteins vldl and chylomicrons tango1 and tali assemble into rings around copii coats and this function is necessary for cargo export the mia3 gene resides on chromosome 1 at the band 1q41 and includes 32 exons this gene produces 4 isoforms through alternative splicing mia3 is a member of the mia otor family the full length protein spans 1 907 amino acids and localizes to the er exit sites it contains an n terminal sh3 like domain two predicted transmembrane domains a coiled coiled domain and a c

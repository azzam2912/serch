in operation it is higher than case temperature and the temperature of the part s exterior the difference is equal to the amount of heat transferred from the junction to case multiplied by the junction to case thermal resistance various physical properties of semiconductor materials are temperature dependent these include the diffusion rate of dopant elements carrier mobilities and the thermal production of charge carriers at the low end sensor diode noise can be reduced by cryogenic cooling on the high end the resulting increase in local power dissipation can lead to thermal runaway that may cause transient or permanent device failure maximum junction temperature sometimes abbreviated tjmax is specified in a part s datasheet and is used when calculating the necessary case to ambient thermal resistance for a given power dissipation this in turn is used to select an appropriate heat sink if applicable other cooling methods include thermoelectric cooling and coolants in modern processors from manufacturer such as intel amd qualcomm the core temperature is measured by a network of sensors every time the temperature sensing network determines that a rise above t is imminent measures such as clock gating clock stretching clock speed reduction and others commonly

the column space of a matrix is the image or range of the corresponding matrix transformation let formula 1 be a field the column space of an m n matrix with components from formula 1 is a linear subspace of the m space formula 3 the dimension of the column space is called the rank of the matrix and is at most min m n a definition for matrices over a ring formula 4 is also possible the row space is defined similarly this article considers matrices of real numbers the row and column spaces are subspaces of the real spaces r and r respectively let a be an m by n matrix then if one considers the matrix as a linear transformation from r to r then the column space of the matrix equals the image of this linear transformation the column space of a matrix a is the set of all linear combinations of the columns in a if a a a then colsp a span a a the concept of row space generalizes to matrices over c the field of complex numbers or over any field intuitively given a matrix a the action of the matrix a

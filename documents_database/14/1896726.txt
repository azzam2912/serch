campbell according to practopoietic theory of system organization downward causation in biological systems always involves the environment downward causation does not occur by direct causal effects from higher to lower levels of system organisation instead downward causation occurs indirectly because the mechanisms at higher levels of organisation fail to accomplish the tasks dictated by the lower levels of organisation as a result inputs from the environment signal to the mechanisms at lower levels of organisation that something is wrong and therefore to act for example a species may find itself under evolutionary pressure to adjust to novel circumstances which is a form of downward pressure for adjustment similarly an organism may be under downward pressure to express different genes if the expression patterns from the past did not lead to desired results another special case of downward causation is supervised learning of neuronal networks in which both behavior and environment govern the propagation from higher to lower levels this leads to a unique form of a causal interaction pattern called a practopoietic loop cycle of causation the end result is that the mechanisms responsible for mental events cause physical events only based on their joint interaction with the environment an

zwanzig in 1954 according to the free energy perturbation method the free energy difference for going from state a to state b is obtained from the following equation known as the zwanzig equation where t is the temperature k is boltzmann s constant and the triangular brackets denote an average over a simulation run for state a in practice one runs a normal simulation for state a but each time a new configuration is accepted the energy for state b is also computed the difference between states a and b may be in the atom types involved in which case the f obtained is for mutating one molecule onto another or it may be a difference of geometry in which case one obtains a free energy map along one or more reaction coordinates this free energy map is also known as a potential of mean force or pmf free energy perturbation calculations only converge properly when the difference between the two states is small enough therefore it is usually necessary to divide a perturbation into a series of smaller windows which are computed independently since there is no need for constant communication between the simulation for one window and the

they catalyze the internal transfer of a phosphate group from c 3 to c 2 which results in the conversion of 3 phosphoglycerate 3pg to 2 phosphoglycerate 2pg through a 2 3 bisphosphoglycerate intermediate these enzymes are categorized into the two distinct classes of either cofactor dependent dpgm or cofactor independent ipgm the dpgm enzyme is composed of approximately 250 amino acids and is found in all vertebrates as well as in some invertebrates fungi and bacteria the ipgm class is found in all plants and algae as well as in some invertebrate fungi and gram positive bacteria this class of pgm enzyme shares the same superfamily as alkaline phosphatase pgm is an isomerase enzyme effectively transferring a phosphate group po from the c 3 carbon of 3 phosphoglycerate to the c 2 carbon forming 2 phosphoglycerate there are a total of three reactions dpgm can catalyze a mutase reaction resulting in the conversion of 3pg to 2pg and vice versa a phosphatase reaction creating phosphoglycerate from 2 3 bisphosphoglycerate and a synthase reaction producing 2 3 bisphosphoglycerate from 1 3 bisphosphoglycerate similar to the enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase kinetic and structural studies have provided evidence that indicate dpgm and bisphosphoglycerate

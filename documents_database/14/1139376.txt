it is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein which has a so far largely unknown role in mtdna maintenance protein mpv17 is expressed in human pancreas kidney muscle liver lung placenta brain and heart human mpv17 is the orthologue of the mouse kidney disease gene mpv17 loss of function has been shown to cause hepatocerebral mtdna depletion syndromes mds with oxidative phosphorylation failure and mtdna depletion both in affected individuals and in mpv17 mice this protein was first thought to be a peroxisomal protein but in 2006 spinazzola demonstrated that it is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that is implicated in the formation of reactive oxygen species ros restoration of mpv17 expression in a mpv17 mice restore mtdna copy number suggesting mpv17 is involved in mtdna copy number and in mtdna maintenance mpv17 seems to be also involved in apoptosis in podocytes and involved in ros the human mpv17 gene is located on chromosome 2 at p21 23 comprising eight exons encoding 176 amino acids mpv17 belongs to a family of integral membrane proteins consisting of four members pxmp2 mpv17 mp l and fksg24 mpv17l2 in mammals and two members sym1 and yor292 in yeast the amino acid sequence of mpv17

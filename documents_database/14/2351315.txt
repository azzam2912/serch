calu 3 cells are epithelial and can act as respiratory models in preclinical applications calu 3 cells were first derived in 1975 by germain trempe and jorgen fogh of the memorial sloan kettering cancer center the cells were isolated from the pleural effusion of a 25 year old caucasian male with a lung adenocarcinoma the calu 3 cell line grows as an adherent monolayer and overexpresses the erbb2 gene leading to active erbb2 her2 the cells also express ck7 occludin and e cadherin calu 3 cells also have large amounts of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator calu 3 cells are commonly used as both in vitro and in vivo models for drug development against lung cancer the cells have been used in studies of pulmonary drug delivery demonstrating a capacity to intake low molecular weight substances calu 3 cells have served as respiratory models for air intake and lung injury due to their responsiveness to foreign substances the calu 3 cell line has shown to be useful in the study of chloride ion secretion by lung epithelial cells the cells may be used in high throughput screening applications focused on barrier integrity and surface protein expression of lung cells

these lower motor neurons innervate the muscles of facial expression and the stapedius the nucleus is situated in the caudal portion of the ventrolateral pontine tegmentum its axons take an unusual course traveling dorsally and looping around the abducens nucleus then traveling ventrally to exit the ventral pons medial to the spinal trigeminal nucleus these axons form the motor component of the facial nerve with parasympathetic and sensory components forming the intermediate nerve the nucleus has a dorsal and ventral region with neurons in the dorsal region innervating muscles of the upper face and neurons in the ventral region innervating muscles of the lower face because it innervates muscles derived from pharyngeal arches the facial motor nucleus is considered part of the special visceral efferent sve cell column which also includes the trigeminal motor nucleus nucleus ambiguus and arguably the spinal accessory nucleus like all lower motor neurons cells of the facial motor nucleus receive cortical input from the primary motor cortex in the frontal lobe of the brain upper motor neurons of the cortex send axons that descend through the internal capsule and synapse on neurons in the facial motor nucleus this pathway from the cortex to the brainstem

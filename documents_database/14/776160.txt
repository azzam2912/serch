the intuitive idea is that a given collection of measures does not escape to infinity let formula 1 be a topological space and let formula 2 be a algebra on formula 3 that contains the topology formula 4 thus every open subset of formula 3 is a measurable set and formula 2 is at least as fine as the borel algebra on formula 3 let formula 8 be a collection of possibly signed or complex measures defined on formula 2 the collection formula 8 is called tight or sometimes uniformly tight if for any formula 11 there is a compact subset formula 12 of formula 3 such that for all measures formula 14 where formula 16 is the total variation measure of formula 17 very often the measures in question are probability measures so the last part can be written as if a tight collection formula 8 consists of a single measure formula 17 then depending upon the author formula 17 may either be said to be a tight measure or to be an inner regular measure if formula 22 is an formula 3 valued random variable whose probability distribution on formula 3 is a tight measure then formula 22

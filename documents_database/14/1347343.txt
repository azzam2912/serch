instances where this slope fails resulting in a rock or earthfall can result in loss of life injuries and damage or destruction of equipment see mining it has been found that over the last few hours preceding a slope failure there is nearly always a small movement or alteration in the movement pattern in the rock face of that section the system is intended to monitor mine slopes to detect this movement and generate a warning of impending failure slope stability so that personnel and equipment may be removed prior to the failure the radar element provides very accurate real time all weather slope movement measurements with sub millimetre detection ability and is able to provide an alarm if the detected movement reaches a predetermined level thereby permitting evacuation of the unstable area and enhancing safety all radar measurements are fully geo referenced to an accuracy that allows easy integration with standard digital terrain mapping dtm tools a second function of the movement and surveying radar is to determine the absolute range to the electromagnetic reflective centroid of an area on a body of material or geographical feature this functionality combined with the accurately surveyed position of the measurement origin

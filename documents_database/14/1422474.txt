additionally increased functional demand can also stimulate this growth in tissues and organs the growth can be a result of increased cell size compensatory hypertrophy or an increase in cell division compensatory hyperplasia or both for instance if one kidney is surgically removed the cells of other kidney divide at an increased rate eventually the remaining kidney can grow until its mass approaches the combined mass of two kidneys along with the kidneys compensatory growth has also been characterized in a number of other tissues and organs including a large number of growth factors and hormones are involved with compensatory growth but the exact mechanism is not fully understood and probably varies between different organs nevertheless angiogenic growth factors which control the growth of blood vessels are particularly important because blood flow significantly determines the maximum growth of an organ compensatory growth may also refer to the accelerated growth following a period of slowed growth particularly as a result of nutrient deprivation

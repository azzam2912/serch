the pyruvate dehydrogenase pdh complex is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial multienzyme complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa and co and provides the primary link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle the pdh complex is composed of multiple copies of three enzymatic components pyruvate dehydrogenase e1 dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase e2 and lipoamide dehydrogenase e3 the e1 enzyme is a heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta subunits this gene encodes the e1 beta subunit mutations in this gene are associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase e1 beta deficiency the pdh genes that comprise the e1 subunit are 1 36 kilobases long alpha and 1 69 kb long beta the pdhb gene has a total of 10 exons and 9 introns all intron exon splice junctions follow the standard gt ag rule there was an alu family found in introns 2 and 8 the 5 flanking region gene contains a caat consensus promoter sequence but no tata sequence the transcription start site is an adenine residue located 132 bases upstream from the initiation codon in exon 1 the mrna species that results from transcription of pdhb has been experimentally determined via northern blotting to be 1 6 kb

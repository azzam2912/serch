the systematic name of this enzyme class is 1 2 carboxyphenylamino 1 deoxy d ribulose 5 phosphate carboxy lyase cyclizing 1 c indol 3 yl glycerol 3 phosphate forming other names in common use include indoleglycerol phosphate synthetase indoleglycerol phosphate synthase indole 3 glycerophosphate synthase 1 2 carboxyphenylamino 1 deoxy d ribulose 5 phosphate and carboxy lyase cyclizing this enzyme participates in phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and two component system general it employs one cofactor pyruvate in some bacteria igps is a single chain enzyme in others such as escherichia coli it is the n terminal domain of a bifunctional enzyme that also catalyses n 5 phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase prai activity the third step of tryptophan biosynthesis in fungi igps is the central domain of a trifunctional enzyme that contains a prai c terminal domain and a glutamine amidotransferase gatase n terminal domain a structure of the igps domain of the bifunctional enzyme from the mesophilic bacterium e coli eigps has been compared with the monomeric indole 3 glycerol phosphate synthase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus sigps both are single domain beta alpha 8 barrel proteins with one eigps or two sigps additional helices inserted before the first

as with c s other floating point types it may not necessarily map to an ieee format the codice 1 type was present in the original 1989 c standard but support was improved by the 1999 revision of the c standard or c99 which extended the standard library to include functions operating on codice 1 such as codice 6 and codice 7 long double constants are floating point constants suffixed with l or l lower case l e g 0 333333333333333333l without a suffix the evaluation depends on flt eval method on the x86 architecture most c compilers implement codice 1 as the 80 bit extended precision type supported by x86 hardware sometimes stored as 12 or 16 bytes to maintain data structure alignment as specified in the c99 c11 standards iec 60559 floating point arithmetic annex f an exception is microsoft visual c for x86 which makes codice 1 a synonym for codice 2 the intel c compiler on microsoft windows supports extended precision but requires the codice 11 switch for codice 1 to correspond to the hardware s extended precision format compilers may also use codice 1 for the binary128 this is the case on hp ux solaris

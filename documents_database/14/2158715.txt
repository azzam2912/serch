following and improving the classification systems introduced by carl linnaeus ernst haeckel robert whittaker and carl woese cavalier smith s classification attempts to incorporate the latest developments in taxonomy his classification has been a major foundation in modern taxonomy particularly with revisions and reorganisations of kingdoms and phyla cavalier smith has published extensively on the classification of protists one of his major contributions to biology was his proposal of a new kingdom of life the chromista although the usefulness of the grouping is questionable given that it is generally agreed to be an arbitrary polyphyletic grouping of taxa he also proposed that all chromista and alveolata share the same common ancestor a claim later refuted by studies of morphological and molecular evidence by other labs he named this new group the chromalveolates he also proposed and named many other high rank taxa like opisthokonta 1987 rhizaria 2002 and excavata 2002 together with chromalveolata amoebozoa he amended their description in 1998 and archaeplastida which he called plantae since 1981 the six form the basis of current taxonomy of eukaryotes prof cavalier smith has also published prodigiously on issues such as the origin of various cellular organelles including the nucleus mitochondria genome

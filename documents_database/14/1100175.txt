in eukaryotes this includes the enzyme glcnac phosphotransferase gpt which catalyzes the transfer of n acetylglucosamine 1 phosphate from udp n acetylglucosamine to dolichol phosphate in the first step of glycoprotein synthesis tunicamycin blocks n linked glycosylation n glycans and treatment of cultured human cells with tunicamycin causes cell cycle arrest in g1 phase it is used as an experimental tool in biology e g to induce unfolded protein response tunicamycin is produced by several bacteria including streptomyces clavuligerus and streptomyces lysosuperificus tunicamycin homologues have varying molecular weights owing to the variability in fatty acids side chain conjugates the biosynthesis of tunicamycins was studied in streptomyces chartreusis and a proposed biosynthetic pathway was characterized the bacteria utilize the enzymes in the tun gene cluster tuna n to make tunicamycins tuna uses the starter unit uridine diphosphate n acetyl glucosamine udp glcnac and catalyzes the dehydration of the 6 hydroxyl group first a tyr residue in tuna abstracts a proton from the 4 hydroxyl group forming a ketone at that position a hydride is subsequently abstracted from the 4 carbon by nad forming nadh the ketone is stabilized by hydrogen bonding from the tyr residue and a nearby thr residue a

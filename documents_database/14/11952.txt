the electrons interact with atoms in the sample producing various signals that contain information about the surface topography and composition of the sample the electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern and the position of the beam is combined with the intensity of the detected signal to produce an image in the most common sem mode secondary electrons emitted by atoms excited by the electron beam are detected using an everhart thornley detector the number of secondary electrons that can be detected and thus the signal intensity depends among other things on specimen topography sem can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer specimens are observed in high vacuum in conventional sem or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental sem and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments an account of the early history of sem has been presented by mcmullan although max knoll produced a photo with a 50 mm object field width showing channeling contrast by the use of an electron beam scanner it was manfred von ardenne who in 1937 invented a true microscope with high magnification by scanning a very small raster with a demagnified

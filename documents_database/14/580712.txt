the law states that the speed v of efflux of a fluid through a sharp edged hole at the bottom of a tank filled to a depth h is the same as the speed that a body in this case a drop of water would acquire in falling freely from a height h i e formula 1 where g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s near the surface of the earth this expression comes from equating the kinetic energy gained formula 2 with the potential energy lost mgh and solving for v the law was discovered though not in this form by the italian scientist evangelista torricelli in 1643 it was later shown to be a particular case of bernoulli s principle under the assumptions of an incompressible fluid with negligible viscosity bernoulli s principle states that where v is fluid speed g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s h is the fluid s height above a reference point p is pressure and is density define the opening to be at h 0 at the top of the tank p is equal to the atmospheric pressure and v can be considered 0 because the

they often contain expansive amounts of base cell material that can be utilized for various projects cell banks can be used to generate detailed characterizations of cell lines and can also help mitigate cross contamination of a cell line utilizing cell banks also reduces the cost of cell culture processes providing a cost efficient alternative to keeping cells in culture constantly cell banks are commonly used within fields including stem cell research and pharmaceuticals with cryopreservation being the traditional method of keeping cellular material intact cell banks also effectively reduce the frequency of a cell sample diversifying from natural cell divisions over time before putting the donated cell lines into storage they are first proliferated and multiplied into a large number of identical cells before being stored in a number of cryovials along with the cells cryoprotection agents are also added to the vials to protect the cells from rupturing from ice crystals during the freezing process 10 dmso solution is a common cryoprotection agent these cryovials are then placed into a tray labeled with the cell line s genetic data and placed into cryogenic freezers the freezers contain nitrogen in either liquid or vapor form and the cells are

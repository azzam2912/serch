it is also called snap off diode or charge storage diode or memory varactor and has a variety of uses in microwave electronics as pulse generator or parametric amplifier when diodes switch from forward conduction to reverse cut off a reverse current flows briefly as stored charge is removed it is the abruptness with which this reverse current ceases which characterises the step recovery diode the first published paper on the srd is the authors start the brief survey stating that the recovery characteristics of certain types of pn junction diodes exhibit a discontinuity which may be used to advantage for the generation of harmonics or for the production of millimicrosecond pulses they also refer that they first observed this phenomenon in february 1959 the main phenomenon used in srds is the storage of electric charge during forward conduction which is present in all semiconductor junction diodes and is due to finite lifetime of minority carriers in semiconductors assume that the srd is forward biased and in steady state i e the anode bias current does not change with time since charge transport in a junction diode is mainly due to diffusion i e to a non constant spatial charge

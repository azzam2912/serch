the oldest known dracohorsian is asilisaurus dating to about 245 million years ago in the anisian age of the middle triassic period according to andrea cau 2018 the synapomorphies of dracohorsians are the anterior tympanic recess the axial epipophyses the centrodiapophyseal laminae in the presacral vertebrae the relative size enlargement of the postacetabular process of ilium the elongation of the pubis the proximal sulcus and the reduction of the ligament tuber in the femoral head and the further reduction in length of the fourth metatarsal and toe compared to the third cau defined the group as the most inclusive clade containing megalosaurus bucklandii mantell 1827 but excluding marasuchus lilloensis romer 1971 a good consensus of phylogenetic work supports the sister grouping of silesaurids and dinosaurs but the interrelationships within dinosauria have been debated of particular debate are the positions of various basal triassic dinosaurs such as eodromaeus daemonosaurus pisanosaurus and herrerasaurids and the interrelationships of the major dinosaur groups sauropodomorpha theropoda and ornithischia the reason for this uncertainty is the taxon sampling size and the implications of how they affect the coding for the phylogenetic tree in his paper about the stepwise evolution of the avian bauplan cau 2018 found

in addition it is a major constituent of the mycobacterium cell wall this gycloconjugate is a virulence factor that plays a key role in the human immune system via interaction with various immune cells it is also considered to be a precursor of lipoarabinomannans it is a trigger for tlr 2 it consists of an linked mannan which consists of 50 70 residues with some branches points linked glycosidically to a diglyceride of which the fatty acids are similar to those of the whole cell lipid in addition succinic acid residues are present as o acyl substituents on about one in four of the mannose residues the terminal carboxyl group of the succinic acid providing the whole polymer with a considerable number of acidic functions lipomannan has functional components that resemble lipoteichoic acids a lipophilic region and a hydrophilic portion with frequent acid groups lipomannan is a phosphorylated polysaccharide associated with the cell enelop and is considered to be the multimannosylated form of pim which is primarily located in the plasma membrane structurally lm is composed of two segments a pi anchor to which is attached an d mannan domain both play key roles in inducing cytokine production by phagocytic

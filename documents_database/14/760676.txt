beginning in the early 1990s with the advent of pcr researchers have been able to obtain high quality dna samples from small quantities of hair feathers scales or excrement these noninvasive samples are an improvement over older allozyme and dna sampling techniques that often required larger samples of tissue or the destruction of the studied organism noninvasive genotyping is widely utilized in conservation efforts where capture and sampling may be difficult or disruptive to behavior additionally in medicine this technique is being applied in humans for the diagnosis of genetic disease and early detection of tumors in this context invasivity takes on a separate definition where noninvasive sampling also includes simple blood samples in conservation noninvasive genotyping has been used to supplement traditional techniques with broadly ranging levels of success modern dna amplification methods allow researchers to use fecal or hair samples collected from the field to assess basic information about the specimen including sex or species despite the potential that noninvasive genotyping has in conservation genetics efforts the efficiency of this method is in question as field samples often suffer from degradation and contamination or are difficult to procure for instance a team of researchers successfully used coyote fecal

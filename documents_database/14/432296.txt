for most satellite applications this approach has been superseded by three axis stabilisation it is also used in non satellite applications such as rifle and artillery despinning can be achieved by various techniques including yo yo de spin on rockets with a solid motor upper stage spin stabilization is used to keep the motor from drifting off course as they don t have their own thrusters usually small rockets are used to spin up the spacecraft and rocket then fire the rocket and send the craft off rockets that use spin stabilization the pioneer 4 spacecraft the second object sent on a lunar flyby in 1959 maintained its attitude using spin stabilization the schiaparelli edm lander was spun up to 2 5 rpm before being ejected from the exomars trace gas orbiter prior to its attempted landing on mars in october 2016 another spin stabilized spacecraft is juno which arrived at jupiter orbit in 2016 in operation as a third stage the star 48 rocket booster sits on top of spin table and before it is separated it is spun up to stabilize it during the separation from the previous stage

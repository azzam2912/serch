normal deformation is approximately 1 3 1 1 only some nuclei can exist in superdeformed states the first superdeformed states to be observed were the fission isomers low spin states of elements in the actinide and lanthanide series the strong force decays much faster than the coulomb force which becomes stronger when nucleons are greater than 2 5 femtometers apart for this reason these elements undergo spontaneous fission in the late 1980s high spin superdeformed rotational bands were observed in other regions of the periodic table specific elements include ruthenium rhodium palladium silver osmium iridium platinum gold and mercury the existence of superdeformed states occurs because of a combination of macroscopic and microscopic factors which together lower their energies and make them stable minima of energy as a function of deformation macroscopically the nucleus can be described by the liquid drop model the liquid drop s energy as a function of deformation is at a minimum for zero deformation due to the surface tension term however the curve may become soft with respect to high deformations because of the coulomb repulsion especially for the fission isomers which have high z and also in the case of high spin states because

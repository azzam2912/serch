it unites the elements of a risc processor core a microcontroller and a dsp in one chip package in 1999 infineon launched the first generation of audo automotive unified processor which is based on what the company describes as a 32 bit unified risc mcu dsp microcontroller core called tricore which is as of 2011 on its fourth generation called audo max version 1 6 tricore is a heterogeneous asymmetric dual core architecture with a peripheral control processor that enables user modes and core system protection infineon s audo families targets gasoline and diesel engine control units ecus applications in hybrid and electric vehicles as well as transmission active and passive safety and chassis applications it also targets industrial applications e g optimized motor control applications and signal processing different models offer different combinations of memories peripheral sets frequencies temperatures and packaging infineon also offers software claimed to help manufacturers meet sil asil safety standards all members of the audo family are binary compatible and share the same development tools an autosar library that enables existing code to be integrated is also available infineon s portfolio includes microcontrollers with additional hardware features as well as safetcore safety software and a

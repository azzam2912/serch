they are dual to the homotopy groups but less studied the p th cohomotopy set of a pointed topological space x is defined by the set of pointed homotopy classes of continuous mappings from formula 2 to the p sphere formula 3 for p 1 this set has an abelian group structure and provided formula 2 is a cw complex is isomorphic to the first cohomology group formula 5 since the circle formula 6 is an eilenberg maclane space of type formula 7 in fact it is a theorem of heinz hopf that if formula 2 is a cw complex of dimension at most p then formula 9 is in bijection with the p th cohomology group formula 10 the set formula 9 also has a natural group structure if formula 2 is a suspension formula 13 such as a sphere formula 14 for formula 15 if x is not homotopy equivalent to a cw complex then formula 5 might not be isomorphic to formula 17 a counterexample is given by the warsaw circle whose first cohomology group vanishes but admits a map to formula 6 which is not homotopic to a constant map some basic facts about cohomotopy sets

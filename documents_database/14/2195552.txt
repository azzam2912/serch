its part of a prototyping platform called ebot innovation platform software electronics mechanical parts to allow fast and easy prototyping the platfoem has received many national and international prizes ebot board is a mini integrated digital computer that consists of a processor ram and input output peripheral devices unlike processors used in pcs ebot was designed for embedded systems to control operations the ebot microcontroller was built using an atmega1284p integrated circuit from the avr 8 bit family which uses 8 bits to build the commands the diagram consists of two layers the first layer has atmega1284p pin functions the second has the arduino compatible pins bootloader and the second layer has the names of the ebot pins the pin names and placement have been modified to suit the unit s inputs and outputs ports which will facilitate the programming process for the user ebot ide was developed by creativebits co and was designed to teach programming in a simple way the software allows users to program using a command line interface or a graphical interface with a data lab to analyze the records a serial monitor to view current readings and an pc control interface to add more advanced

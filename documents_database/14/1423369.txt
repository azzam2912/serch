of course all matter is inhomogeneous at some scale but frequently it is convenient to treat it as homogeneous a good example is the continuum concept which is used in continuum mechanics under this assumption materials such as fluids solids etc can be treated as homogeneous materials and associated with these materials are material properties such as shear modulus elastic moduli etc frequently inhomogeneous materials such as composite materials possess microstructure and therefore they are subjected to loads or forcings which vary on a lengthscale which is far bigger than the characteristic lengthscale of the microstructure in this situation one can often replace the equation above with an equation of the form where formula 7 is a constant tensor coefficient and is known as the effective property associated with the material in question it can be explicitly computed as from 1 periodic functions formula 9 satisfying this process of replacing an equation with a highly oscillatory coefficient with one with a homogeneous uniform coefficient is known as homogenization this subject is inextricably linked with the subject of micromechanics for this very reason in homogenization one equation is replaced by another if formula 11 for small enough formula 2 provided formula

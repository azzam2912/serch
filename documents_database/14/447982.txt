color print film is the most common type of photographic film in consumer use print film produces a negative image when it is developed requiring it to be reversed again when it is printed onto photographic paper almost all color print film made today is designed to be processed according to the c 41 process color negatives are prone to damage through fingerprints and tears therefore it is a good idea to wear nylon or cotton gloves when handling them and placing them in negative sleeves avoid bending folding or rolling up your negatives sleeves as well generally color prints are more sensitive to temperature and light as opposed to black and white film therefore there are more precautions to take when trying to protect and optimize the lifespan of them it is important to keep the prints protected from physical damage from as little as a fingerprint to as much as scratches that can destroy them completely storage for prints that are developed from color print film should be free of any unsafe harmful chemicals specifically referring to peroxides sulfur dioxide ozone and nitrogen oxides for the best prolonged storage and protection placing the prints in polyester uncoated sleeves

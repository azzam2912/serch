the process is also called hinged lid inactivation or n type inactivation a voltage gated ion channel can be in three states open closed or inactivated the inactivated state is mainly achieved through fast inactivation by which a channel transitions rapidly from an open to an inactivated state the model proposes that the inactivated state which is stable and non conducting is caused by the physical blockage of the pore the blockage is caused by a ball of amino acids connected to the main protein by a string of residues on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane the ball enters the open channel and binds to the hydrophobic inner vestibule within the channel this blockage causes inactivation of the channel by stopping the flow of ions this phenomenon has mainly been studied in potassium channels and sodium channels the initial evidence for a ball and chain inactivation came in 1977 with clay armstrong and francisco bezanilla s work the suggestion of a physical basis for non conductance came from experiments in squid giant axons showing that internal treatment with pronase disrupted the inactivation phenomenon this suggested a physical tethered mechanism for inactivation as the pronase was inferred to degrade the

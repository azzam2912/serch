the technologies may consist of various pipes liners access ports sampling pumps pressure sensors and sealing mechanisms that are installed temporarily or permanently in boreholes drilled into unconsolidated sediments or bedrock mls systems facilitate 1 ongoing measurement and monitoring of depth discrete water pressures hydraulic heads and 2 repeated collection of depth discrete groundwater samples for chemical testing commercial mls systems are available with as few as three ports cmt system to more than 20 ports mp westbay and solinst waterloo systems an essential design element of all mls systems is that they must prevent hydraulic connection of the various monitored intervals within the wellbore while installed primarily in water saturated sediments and rock mls systems can also be installed in the vadose zone for the collection of depth discrete soil gas samples hybrid mls systems can be constructed with some ports in the vadose zone and some ports in the saturated zone prior to the 1970s collection of discrete groundwater samples from multiple depths in the subsurface required the installation of well clusters or nested wells well clusters consist of a closely spaced group of monitoring wells each well completed to a different depth in individual boreholes well clusters

f gracilis is reported from many parts of europe in sweden even as one of the dominant freshwater diatom taxa despite its frequent occurrence there has been some confusion about the identification of this taxon however a recent study using both molecular and morphological data has shown that f gracilis is separated from other similar long fragilaria taxa and can be identified by both its rbcl barcode and by using light microscopy lm in lm is can be identified by its quite stable character of almost parallel valve sides in the long cells and the clear opposite arrangement of the striae giving the impression of regularly arranged parallel lines across the valve in lm these characters are also in agreement with strup s original description of 1910 of almost linear valves and tuji s observation of the type material describing the striae as being parallel throughout with sem pictures showing mainly opposite striae the valve shown in the original picture of strup 1910 tab v fig 117 has a length of 43 and a width of 2 1 m with 25 striae per 10 m the microphotographs from the lectotype slide coll strup 1342 given in krammer and lange bertalot

it is a colorless liquid in humans it is a toxic metabolite of hexane and of 2 hexanone the chronic toxicity of hexane is attributed to hexane 2 5 dione the symptoms are tingling and cramps in the arms and legs followed by general muscular weakness in severe cases atrophy of the skeletal muscles is observed along with a loss of coordination and vision problems similar symptoms are observed in animal models they are associated with a degeneration of the peripheral nervous system and eventually the central nervous system starting with the distal portions of the longer and wider nerve axons it appears that the neurotoxicity of 2 5 hexanedione resides in its diketone structure since 2 3 2 4 hexanedione and 2 6 heptanedione are not neurotoxic whereas 2 5 heptanedione and 3 6 octanedione and other diketones are 2 5 hexanedione reacts with lysine residues in axonal proteins by schiff base formation followed by cyclization to give pyrroles oxidation of the pyrrole residues then causes cross linking and denaturation of proteins which perturbs axonal transport and function and causes damage to nerve cells 2 5 hexanedione has been prepared in several ways a common method involves hydrolysis of

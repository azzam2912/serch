it is named after french engineer and mathematician jean victor poncelet poncelet s porism can be proved by an argument using an elliptic curve whose points represent a combination of a line tangent to one conic and a crossing point of that line with the other conic let c and d be two plane conics if it is possible to find for a given n 2 one n sided polygon that is simultaneously inscribed in c meaning that all of its vertices lie on c and circumscribed around d meaning that all of its edges are tangent to d then it is possible to find infinitely many of them each point of c or d is a vertex or tangency respectively of one such polygon if the conics are circles the polygons that are inscribed in one circle and circumscribed about the other are called bicentric polygons so this special case of poncelet s porism can be expressed more concisely by saying that every bicentric polygon is part of an infinite family of bicentric polygons with respect to the same two circles view c and d as curves in the complex projective plane p for simplicity assume that c and

as in unification several frameworks are distinguished depending on which expressions also called terms are allowed and which expressions are considered equal if variables representing functions are allowed in an expression the process is called higher order anti unification otherwise first order anti unification if the generalization is required to have an instance literally equal to each input expression the process is called syntactical anti unification otherwise e anti unification or anti unification modulo theory an anti unification algorithm should compute for given expressions a complete and minimal generalization set that is a set covering all generalizations and containing no redundant members respectively depending on the framework a complete and minimal generalization set may have one finitely many or possibly infinitely many members or may not exist at all it cannot be empty since a trivial generalization exists in any case for first order syntactical anti unification gordon plotkin gave an algorithm that computes a complete and minimal singleton generalization set containing the so called least general generalization lgg anti unification should not be confused with dis unification the latter means the process of solving systems of inequations that is of finding values for the variables such that all given

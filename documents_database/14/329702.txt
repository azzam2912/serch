the vr tube then acts as a negative resistance device as the current through the device increases the amount of ionization also increases reducing the resistance of the device to further current flow in this way the device conducts sufficient current to hold the voltage across its terminals to the desired value because the device would conduct a nearly unlimited amount of current there must be some external means of limiting the current usually this is provided by an external resistor upstream from the vr tube the vr tube then conducts any portion of the current that does not flow into the downstream load maintaining an approximately constant voltage across the vr tube s electrodes the vr tube s regulation voltage was only guaranteed when conducting an amount of current within the allowable range in particular if the current through the tube is too low to maintain ionization the output voltage can rise above the nominal output as far as the input supply voltage if the current through the tube is too high it can enter an arc discharge mode where the voltage will be significantly lower than nominal and the tube may be damaged some voltage regulator tubes contained

people can often make better predictions or choices with less information more information is not always better an example of information bias is believing that the more information that can be acquired to make a decision the better even if that extra information is irrelevant for the decision in an experiment subjects considered this diagnostic problem involving fictitious diseases a female patient is presenting symptoms and a history which both suggest a diagnosis of globoma with about 80 probability if it isn t globoma it s either popitis or flapemia each disease has its own treatment which is ineffective against the other two diseases a test called the et scan would certainly yield a positive result if the patient had popitis and a negative result if she has flapemia if the patient has globoma a positive and negative result are equally likely if the et scan was the only test you could do should you do it why or why not many subjects answered that they would conduct the et scan even if it were costly and even if it were the only test that could be done however the test in question does not affect the course of action

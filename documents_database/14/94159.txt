protein catabolism which is the breakdown of macromolecules is essentially a digestion process protein catabolism is most commonly carried out by non specific endo and exo proteases however specific proteases are used for cleaving of proteins for regulatory and protein trafficking purposes one example is the subclass of proteolytic enzymes called oligopeptidase the amino acids produced by catabolism may be directly recycled to form new proteins converted into different amino acids or can undergo amino acid catabolism to be converted to other compounds via the krebs cycle the primary reason for protein catabolism is so organisms can convert proteins into a form of energy that the body can use to reuse their proteins bacteria or soil microorganisms break down their proteins through protein catabolism into their individual amino acids and are used to form bacterial proteins or oxidized for energy to convert to energy once the proteins are broken down they are typically deaminated removal of an amino group so that they can be processed into the krebs citric acid tca cycle by proceeding into the citric acid cycle the original proteins will be converted into usable energy for the organism there are also other processes to convert amino acids

it is licensed as public domain the method was published by robert c edgar in two papers in 2004 the first paper published in nucleic acids research introduced the sequence alignment algorithm the second paper published in bmc bioinformatics presented more technical details the muscle algorithm proceeds in three stages the draft progressive improved progressive and refinement stages in the draft progressive stage the algorithm produces a draft multiple alignment emphasising speed over accuracy in the improved progressive stage the kimura distance is used to reestimate the binary tree to create the draft alignment in turn producing a more accurate multiple alignment the final refinement stage refines the improved alignment made in step two multiple alignments are available at the end of each stage in the first two stages of the algorithm the time complexity is the space complexity is the refinement stage adds to the time complexity another term muscle is often used as a replacement for clustal since it usually but not always gives better sequence alignments depending on the chosen options also muscle is significantly faster than clustal more so for larger alignments muscle is integrated into dnastar s lasergene software geneious and macvector and is available

it was invented by david karger and first published in 1993 the idea of the algorithm is based on the concept of contraction of an edge formula 1 in an undirected graph formula 2 informally speaking the contraction of an edge merges the nodes formula 3 and formula 4 into one reducing the total number of nodes of the graph by one all other edges connecting either formula 3 or formula 4 are reattached to the merged node effectively producing a multigraph karger s basic algorithm iteratively contracts randomly chosen edges until only two nodes remain those nodes represent a cut in the original graph by iterating this basic algorithm a sufficient number of times a minimum cut can be found with high probability a cut formula 7 in an undirected graph formula 2 is a partition of the vertices formula 9 into two non empty disjoint sets formula 10 the cutset of a cut consists of the edges formula 11 between the two parts the size or weight of a cut in an unweighted graph is the cardinality of the cutset i e the number of edges between the two parts there are formula 13 ways of choosing for

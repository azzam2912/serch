the bogoliubov transformation is an isomorphism of either the canonical commutation relation algebra or canonical anticommutation relation algebra this induces an autoequivalence on the respective representations the bogoliubov transformation is often used to diagonalize hamiltonians which yields the stationary solutions of the corresponding schr dinger equation the bogoliubov transformation is also important for understanding the unruh effect hawking radiation pairing effects in nuclear physics and many other topics the bogoliubov transformation is often used to diagonalize hamiltonians with a corresponding transformation of the state function operator eigenvalues calculated with the diagonalized hamiltonian on the transformed state function thus are the same as before consider the canonical commutation relation for bosonic creation and annihilation operators in the harmonic basis define a new pair of operators for complex number u and v where the latter is the hermitian conjugate of the first the bogoliubov transformation is the canonical transformation mapping the operators formula 4 and formula 5 to formula 6 and formula 7 to find the conditions on the constants u and v such that the transformation is canonical the commutator is evaluated viz it is then evident that formula 9 is the condition for which the transformation is canonical since the

the project began in 1954 with study contracts for an early warning radar system which was followed by the february 1955 release of air staff target 1135 ast 1135 calling for a system to counter intermediate range ballistic missiles irbms being fired at the uk from eastern europe ast 1135 required the system to be able to attack six targets at once and be ready for initial deployment in 1963 after many changes due both to technical progress and changes in the strategic mission in 1958 an interim design emerged that used existing missiles and radars to lower cost the concept used ames type 85 radars in east anglia for long range early detection as soon as the missiles rose above the radar horizon initial tracking of the warheads would then be handed off to an fps 16 radars in the uk and the netherlands as they approached the uk track information from the fps 16 would direct a ames type 86 fire control radar to begin illuminating each selected target the enemy warheads would be attacked by a nuclear armed bloodhound mk 3 with interceptions taking place between due to the short flight times of the ballistic missiles and

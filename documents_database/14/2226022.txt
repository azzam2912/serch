its mode of action does not depend on direct killing or inhibition of the invading pathogen but rather on increasing physical or chemical barrier of the host plant like the systemic acquired resistance sar a plant can develop defenses against an invader such as a pathogen or parasite if an infection takes place in contrast to sar which is triggered by accumulation of pathogenesis related proteins or salicylic acid isr instead relies on signal transduction pathways activated by jasmonate and ethylene the induction of plant induced resistance to pathogen protection was identified in 1901 and was described as the system of acquired resistance subsequently several different terms have been used namely acquired physiological immunity resistance displacement plant immune function and induced system resistance many forms of stimulus have been found to induce the plant to the virus bacteria and fungi and other disease resistance including mechanical factors dry ice damage electromagnetic ultraviolet and low temperature and high temperature treatment etc chemical factors heavy metal salts water salicylic acid and biological factors fungi bacteria viruses and their metabolites induced resistance of plants has two major modes of action the sar pathway and the isr pathway sar can elicit a rapid local

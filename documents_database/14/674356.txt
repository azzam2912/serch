the type species lirainosaurus astibiae was described by sanz powell le loeuff martinez and pereda suberbiola in 1999 this genus was based on a skull fragment isolated teeth several vertebrae including the holotype an anterior caudal vertebra and appendicular bones from the late cretaceous of la o northern spain new material from la o spain described by diaz et al 2013 which includes cervical dorsal and caudal vertebrae dorsal ribs and a haemal arch has been assigned to lirainosaurus according to diaz et al lirainosaurus can be distinguished by the presence of a lamina in the interzygapophyseal fossa of the most proximal caudal vertebrae and the spinopostzygapophyseal structure not posteriorly projected in the posterior caudal vertebrae with respect to phylogeny the combination of characters present in the new axial remains described supports the placement of lirainosaurus as a derived lithostrotian titanosaur closely related to the saltasaurinae the results of an unpublished svpca abstract published in 2016 narrow down the exact position of lirainosaurus by placing it as closer to alamosaurus and opisthocoelicauda than to saltasaurus later diez diaz et al 2018 erected lirainosaurinae to accommodate lirainosaurus as well as ampelosaurus and atsinganosaurus specimens have been found in the north pyrenean

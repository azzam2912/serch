gram positive bacterium characteristics include small irregular rods lateral flagella the ability to persist in aerobic environments and cells containing catalase in the interest of studying pathogenicity in plants the species curtobacterium flaccumfaciens is broken down further into pathovars which help to better describe the pathogen curtobacterium flaccumfacien is a bacterial wilt pathogen the hallmark symptoms of bacterial wilt are leaf and petiole wilting chlorosis of the leaf and tissue occurs due to the lack of water transport curtobacterium flaccumfaciens as a species has a wide host range not limited to kidney beans soybeans tulips and tomatoes however the species is artificially separated into a pathovar based on host range and symptoms one of the economically important pathovars is curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv flaccumfaciens this pathovar is classified as bacterial wilt and has a primary host range of the genus phaseolus beans but the pathogen can infect many other species of the fabaceae in beans the symptoms can be devastating to the crop yield these beans have severe foliage wilting and chlorosis one ornamental example is curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv oortii the primary host are plants from the genus tulipa tulip although the host range differs the symptoms are relatively similar during

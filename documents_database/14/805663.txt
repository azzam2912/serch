there are two types of concrete pumps the first type of concrete pump is attached to a truck or longer units are on semi trailers it is known as a boom concrete pump because it uses a remote controlled articulating robotic arm called a boom to place concrete accurately boom pumps are used on most of the larger construction projects as they are capable of pumping at very high volumes and because of the labour saving nature of the placing boom they are a revolutionary alternative to line concrete pumps the second main type of concrete pump is either mounted on a truck or placed on a trailer and it is commonly referred to as a line pump or trailer mounted concrete pump this pump requires steel or flexible concrete placing hoses to be manually attached to the outlet of the machine those hoses are linked together and lead to wherever the concrete needs to be placed the length of the hoses varies typically 10 12 5 25 and 50 depending on the diameter of the hose line pumps normally pump concrete at lower volumes than boom pumps and are used for smaller volume concrete placing applications such as swimming

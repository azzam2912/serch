it is a six membered heterocyclic aromatic ring one of several isomeric triazines s triazine and its derivatives are useful in a variety of applications symmetrical 1 3 5 triazines are prepared by trimerization of certain nitriles such as cyanogen chloride or cyanimide benzoguanamine with one phenyl and 2 amino substituents is synthesised from benzonitrile and dicyandiamide in the pinner triazine synthesis named after adolf pinner the reactants are an alkyl or aryl amidine and phosgene insertion of an n h moiety into a hydrazide by a copper carbenoid followed by treatment with ammonium chloride also gives the triazine core amine substituted triazines called guanamines are prepared by the condensation of cyanoguanidine with the corresponding nitrile as a reagent in organic synthesis s triazine is used as the equivalent of hydrogen cyanide hcn being a solid vs a gas for hcn triazine is sometimes easier to handle in the laboratory one application is in the gattermann reaction used to attach the formyl group to aromatic substrates n and c substituted triazines are used industrially the most common derivative of 1 3 5 triazine is 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 6 triamine commonly known as melamine or cyanuramide another important

in essence cell adhesion molecules help cells stick to each other and to their surroundings cell adhesion is a crucial component in maintaining tissue structure and function in fully developed animals these molecules play an integral role in creating force and movement and consequently ensure that organs are able to execute their functions in addition to serving as molecular glue cell adhesion is important in affecting cellular mechanisms of growth contact inhibition and apoptosis oftentimes aberrant expression of cams will result in pathologies ranging from frostbite to cancer combined with cell junctions and ecm cams help hold animal cells together cams are typically single pass transmembrane receptors and are composed of three conserved domains an intracellular domain that interacts with the cytoskeleton a transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain these proteins can interact in several different ways the first method is through homophilic binding where cams bind with the same cams they are also capable of heterophilic binding meaning a cam on one cell will bind with different cams on another cell the final type of binding occurs between cells and substrate where a mutual extracellular ligand that binds two different cams there are four major superfamilies or groups of

it was presumed in the past that the main causes of desertification lay in overuse of the land resulting in impoverishment of the soil reduced vegetation cover increased risk of drought and the resulting wind erosion however recent projects to regreen deserts have not met with the success envisaged and cast doubts on this theory research suggests that it is extreme events rather than drought caused by low annual precipitation that do the most damage heavy downpours resulting in flash floods wash away sediment and there seems to have been an increased number of extreme events in the levant at the end of the byzantine period the decline of settlements in the desert belt at this time may have been caused by these extreme events rather than a reduction in annual precipitation the mediterranean and its transition zones to the deserts are characterized by impressive roman and byzantine ruins which are subject of discussion as to how these magnificent cities came to be deserted it was assumed that population growth or conquest by nomadic tribes led to over exploitation of the land leading to soil erosion and irreversible degradation reduced soil and vegetation cover led to reduced precipitation and advancing

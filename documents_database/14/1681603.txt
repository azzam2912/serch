the other two sites are the a site aminoacyl which is the first binding site in the ribosome and the e site exit the third during protein translation the p site holds the trna which is linked to the growing polypeptide chain when a stop codon is reached the peptidyl trna bond of the trna located in the p site is cleaved releasing the newly synthesized protein during the translocation step of the elongation phase the mrna is advanced by one codon coupled to movement of the trnas from the ribosomal a to p and p to e sites catalyzed by elongation factor ef g the ribosomal p site plays a vital role in all phases of translation initiation involves recognition of the start codon aug by initiator trna in the p site elongation involves passage of many elongator trnas through the p site termination involves hydrolysis of the mature polypeptide from trna bound to the p site and ribosome recycling involves release of deacylated trna binding a trna to the p site in the presence of mrna establishes codon anticodon interaction and this interaction is important for small subunit ribosome 30s contacts to the trna the classical two state

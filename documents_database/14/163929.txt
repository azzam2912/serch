the n th pentagonal number p is the number of distinct dots in a pattern of dots consisting of the outlines of regular pentagons with sides up to n dots when the pentagons are overlaid so that they share one vertex for instance the third one is formed from outlines comprising 1 5 and 10 dots but the 1 and 3 of the 5 coincide with 3 of the 10 leaving 12 distinct dots 10 in the form of a pentagon and 2 inside p is given by the formula for n 1 the first few pentagonal numbers are 1 5 12 22 35 51 70 92 117 145 176 210 247 287 330 376 425 477 532 590 651 715 782 852 925 1001 1080 1162 1247 1335 1426 1520 1617 1717 1820 1926 2035 2147 2262 2380 2501 2625 2752 2882 3015 3151 3290 3432 3577 3725 3876 4030 4187 the n th pentagonal number is one third of the 3n 1 th triangular number generalized pentagonal numbers are obtained from the formula given above but with n taking values in the sequence 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 producing the sequence 0 1 2 5

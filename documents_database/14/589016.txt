they belong to subfamily rhacophoridae members of this genus are collectively known as whipping frogs they occur in east south and southeast asia the delimitation of polypedates versus the related rhacophorus has been difficult in former times the present genus was often entirely included in rhacophorus however molecular phylogenetic studies support the recognition of both genera polypedates taruga are considered to be the sister taxon of feihyla rhacophorus currently 24 species are included in polypedates with new species still being described on a regular basis the recently described polypedates bijui has now been renamed as beddomixalus bijui the only species in its genus the following phylogeny of polypedates is from pyron wiens 2011 8 species are included polypedates is a sister group of feihyla together polypedates and feihyla form a sister group to rhacophorus kuraishi et al 2013 gives the following phylogeny of polypedates polypedates and rhacophorus are estimated to have split off from their most recent common ancestor 26 6 million years ago during the oligocene

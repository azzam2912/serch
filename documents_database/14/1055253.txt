in room and pillar mining tunnels are advanced in a rectangular pattern resembling city streets tunnels leaving behind blocks pillars of coal to a miner a partially completed tunnel resembles a room dug into the coal seam as mining proceeds the weight of rock overburden previously supported by coal mined from rooms is redistributed to pillars if that weight exceeds the strength of a pillar the pillar can fail by crushing or exploding an explosive failure is called a bump in the eastern united states coalfields bumps are more likely when the overburden is at least 500 feet 150 m where a strong overlying stratum such as sandstone occurs near the coalbed and with a strong inflexible floor in the united states the number of deaths from bumps had dropped off dramatically since the early 1990s but fatalities are more common in the west where mines often run deeper bumps are three times more likely in room and pillar mines and are even more common in mines that do retreat mining in which the pillars are removed as the miners retreat towards the mine entrance with the intent of allowing an orderly collapse of the mine the springhill mining disaster

missiles greatly enhance a vessel s ability to attack surface combatants and strike land targets and although torpedoes are a more stealthy option missiles give a much longer stand off range as well as the ability to engage multiple targets on different headings at the same time many cruise missile submarines retain the capability to deploy nuclear warheads on their missiles but they are considered distinct from ballistic missile submarines due to the substantial differences between the two weapons systems characteristics originally early designs of cruise missile submarines had to surface to launch their missiles while later designs could do so underwater via dedicated vertical launching system vls tubes many modern attack submarines can launch cruise missiles and dedicated anti ship missiles from their torpedo tubes while some designs also incorporate a small number of vls canisters giving some significant overlap between cruise missile submarines and traditional attack submarines nonetheless vessels classified as attack submarines still use torpedoes as their main armament and have a more multi role mission profile due to their greater speed and maneuverability in contrast to cruise missile submarines which are typically larger slower boats focused on the long distance surface strike role the united states

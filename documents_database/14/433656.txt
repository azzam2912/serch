it is a strong fluorination reagent brf finds use in oxygen isotope analysis laser ablation of solid silicates in the presence of bromine pentafluoride releases o for subsequent analysis it has also been tested as an oxidizer in liquid rocket propellants and is used as a fluorinating agent in the processing of uranium bromine pentafluoride was first prepared in 1931 by the direct reaction of bromine with fluorine this reaction is suitable for the preparation of large quantities and is carried out at temperatures over with an excess of fluorine for the preparation of smaller amounts potassium bromide is used this route yields bromine pentafluoride almost completely free of trifluorides and other impurities bromine pentafluoride reacts violently with water but when moderated by dilution with acetonitrile it will form bromic acid and hydrofluoric acid simple hydrolysis products it is an extremely effective fluorinating agent converting most uranium compounds to the hexafluoride at room temperature bromine pentafluoride is severely corrosive to the skin and its vapors are irritating to the eyes skin and mucous membranes exposure to 100 ppm for a few minutes is lethal to most experimental animals chronic exposure may cause kidney damage and liver failure it may spontaneously

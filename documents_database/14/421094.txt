both concepts are related to certain psychiatric conditions such as hyperactivity the concept of mbd was strongly criticized by sir michael rutter gillberg 2003 p 904 and several other researchers and this led to its abandonment in the 1980s at the same time research showed that something similar was needed one alternative concept was adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder gillberg proposed another alternative damp gillberg s concept was formulated in the early 1980s and the term itself was introduced in a paper that gillberg published in 1986 see gillberg 1986 damp is essentially mbd without the etiological assumptions the concept of damp met with considerable criticism for example sir michael rutter stated that the concept of damp unlike adhd was muddled and lacks both internal coherence and external discriminative validity it has no demonstrated treatment or prognostic implications he concluded that the concept should be abandoned another example is the criticism of per anders rydelius professor of child psychiatry at the karolinska institute who argued that the definition of damp was too vague the borderline between damp and conduct disorders is unclear the borderline between damp and adhd is unclear he concluded that the concept is in need of revision

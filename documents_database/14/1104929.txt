the cerebral hemispheres develop completely but abnormally the condition is frequently though not always associated with anencephaly the fetus is said to suffer from acrania if it meets the following criteria the fetus should have a perfectly normal facial bone a normal cervical column but without the fetal skull and a volume of brain tissue equivalent to at least one third of the normal brain size there are two problems that may occur during development that cause acrania there are no known family ties in acrania and recurrence rates are extremely low not much is known about the exact mechanism involved in acrania it is hypothesized that like other developmental malformations there are multiple origins for acrania recent work has identified mutations in the hedgehog acyltransferase hhat gene that have caused acrania along with holoprosencephaly and agnathia the mutation in which causes this disease is a loss of function mutation before this discovery in 2010 hhat was known to play a role in the sonic hedgehog pathway when hhat contains a loss of function mutation less hhat protein is produced is necessary for the production of hedgehog proteins post transcriptionally as hhat production decreases production of long range hh proteins

it is usually considered a subspecies of the sharp shinned hawk by most taxonomists including the american ornithological society but the taxonomy is far from resolved with some authorities considering the southern taxa to represent three separate species white breasted hawk a chionogaster plain breasted hawk a ventralis and rufous thighed hawk a erythronemius the breeding range of the groups are entirely allopatric although the wintering range of the nominate group partially overlaps with the range of chionogaster as is also the case with certain taxa within the nominate group this allopatry combined with differences in plumage see appearance and apparently certain measurements has been the background for the split but hard scientific data are presently lacking aou disregarding field guides most material published in recent years e g aou ferguson lees et al p 586 and dickinson et al has therefore considered all to be members of a single widespread species but not without equivocation ferguson lees et al say that if they were to make a world list they would include the three taxa as separate species p 75 and the aou s comment includes the note split almost certainly good in bolivia ventralis and erythronemius approach each

he formally named three species each corresponding to a different species of the host animal molecular phylogenetics later showed that nephromyces are not actually fungi but instead constitute a group within the apicomplexa that is related to the piroplasmida nephromyces is found in the lumen of the renal sac of its host animals the renal sac is a closed fluid filled structure that is derived from the epicardium during development there are different cell types at least seven in nephromyces from molgula manhattensis which appear to be different life cycle stages as the different types appear in a consistent sequence after initial infection of the host animal however in a mature infection different stages simultaneously co occur in the same host individual they include filaments trophic stages spores motile but non flagellated cells and biflagellated swarmer cells the non flagellated motile cells resemble the sporozoites of other apicomplexans while the spores contain structures that resemble the rhoptries of the apical complex another typical apicomplexan feature nephromyces is specific to the family molgulidae and has been found in species of molgula and at least one other molgulid genus bostrichobranchus b pilularis every wild collected adult molgula animal examined has been found

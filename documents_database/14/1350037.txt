these measurements are typically made with insertion temperature probes and pressure probes fitted to tapping points on the pump s inlet and outlet from these measurements the flow produced by a pump can be derived the thermodynamic method was developed in the early 1960s and since has been increasingly used it is described in high precision hydraulic testing standards such as iso 5198 the thermodynamic method is used for performance testing of pumps flow meter calibration system curve tests and other applications it is capable of achieving results with uncertainties of less than 1 in pump efficiency and less than 1 5 in flow while being able to test piping configurations where other conventional pump testing methods cannot provide accurate results the thermodynamic method was developed concurrently in the 1960s at the university of glasgow and university of strathclyde in scotland and the national engineering laboratory in france electricite de france and austin whillier chamber of mines johannesburg south africa whillier published a paper titled pump efficiency determination from temperature measurements in the october 1967 edition of the south african mechanical engineer describing the method since that time the thermodynamic method has been rigorously verified in many instances by different

allenes are classified as polyenes with cumulated dienes the parent compound of this class is propadiene which is itself also called allene compounds with an allene type structure but with more than three carbon atoms are called cumulenes allenes are much more reactive than most other alkenes for example their reactivity with gaseous chlorine is more like the reactivity of alkynes than that of alkenes the central carbon atom of allene forms two sigma bonds and two pi bonds the central carbon is sp hybridized and the two terminal carbon atoms are sp hybridized the bond angle formed by the three carbon atoms is 180 indicating linear geometry for the central carbon atom the two terminal carbon atoms are planar and these planes are twisted 90 from each other the structure can also be viewed as an extended tetrahedral with a similar shape to methane an analogy that is continued into the stereochemical analysis of certain derivative molecules the symmetry and isomerism of allenes has long fascinated organic chemists for allenes with four identical substituents there exist two twofold axes of rotation through the center carbon inclined at 45 to the ch planes at either end of the molecule the

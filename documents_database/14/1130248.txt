this protein is also called rhogef11 or pdz rhogef rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 11 is guanine nucleotide exchange factor gef for the rhoa small gtpase protein rho is a small gtpase protein that is inactive when bound to the guanine nucleotide gdp but when acted on by rho gef proteins such as rhogef1 this gdp is released and replaced by gtp leading to the active state of rho in this active gtp bound conformation rho can bind to and activate specific effector proteins and enzymes to regulate cellular functions in particular active rho is a major regulator of the cell actin cytoskeleton rhogef11 is a member of a group of four rhogef proteins known to be activated by g protein coupled receptors coupled to the g and g heterotrimeric g proteins the others are arhgef1 also known as p115 rhogef arhgef12 also known as larg and akap13 also known as arhgef13 and lbc gpcr regulated rhogef11 and these related gef proteins acts as an effector for g and g g proteins in addition to being activated by g or g g proteins three of these four rhogef proteins arhgef1 11 12 also function as rgs family gtpase activating proteins

he provided significant contributions to the theory of beams and frames in structural analysis m ller breslau was both a practicing engineer and theoretical researcher during his lifetime he brought the previously separate elements of classical structural analysis together in a unified theory of beams and frames he systematized the computational methods in particular the principle of virtual displacements and applied the energy sets systematically he also calculated structures of airships after finishing school in 1869 he fought in the war of 1870 71 after which he began to study at the berlin trade academy in 1871 he also attended lectures in mathematics taught by elwin bruno christoffel and karl weierstrass at berlin university as a student he helped fellow students of the school of architecture with their revision of structural analysis and prepared them for the second state examination based on this teaching he compiled his first textbook elementares handbuch der festigkeitslehre elementary handbook of the strength of materials in 1875 two years later he wrote contributions on elasticity and strength as well as structural mechanics for h tte des ingenieurs tachenbuch h tte s engineer s handbook

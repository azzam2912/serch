they are assigned to the stramenopiles heterokonts a group which also contains kelp and various microalgae several stages occur in its lifecycle the feeding form has a stiff rounded body with cellular extensions used in feeding cells can transform into mobile flagellated cells with stiff tripartite hairs typical of the stramenopiles cells can also grow and divide to form a cluster of cells which may become a sorus that produces biflagellated zoospores certain species produce large amounts of docosahexaenoic acid dha and are grown commercially for production of this oil for animal feeds biomass biofuels and direct human consumption in supplements and additives in 2016 juvenile nile tilapia were given a feed containing dried schizochytrium in place of fish oil when compared to a control group raised on regular feed they exhibited higher weight gain and better feed conversion and their flesh was higher in omega 3 fatty acids dha synthesis in schizochytrium does not involve membrane bound desaturases or fatty acid elongation enzymes such as those described for other eukaryotes instead it is thought that dha synthesis in schizochytrium occurs via a polyketide synthase pks based pathway although the primary structures of the polyketide synthases do not conform to

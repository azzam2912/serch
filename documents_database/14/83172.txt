in this example a signal received by the microphone is amplified and passed out of the loudspeaker the sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again amplified further and then passed out through the loudspeaker again the frequency of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone amplifier and loudspeaker the acoustics of the room the directional pick up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker and the distance between them for small pa systems the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech the principles of audio feedback were first discovered by danish scientist s ren absalon larsen hence the name larsen effect feedback is almost always considered undesirable when it occurs with a singer s or public speaker s microphone at an event using a sound reinforcement system or pa system audio engineers typically use directional microphones with cardioid pickup patterns and various electronic devices such as equalizers and since the 1990s automatic feedback detection devices to prevent these unwanted squeals or screeching sounds which detract from the audience s enjoyment of the event and may damage equipment on the other hand since the 1960s electric guitar players

while dna had been known to biologists since 1869 many scientists still assumed at the time that proteins carried the information for inheritance because dna appeared to be an inert molecule and since it is located in the nucleus its role was considered to be phosphorus storage in their experiments hershey and chase showed that when bacteriophages which are composed of dna and protein infect bacteria their dna enters the host bacterial cell but most of their protein does not hershey and chase and subsequent discoveries all served to prove that dna is the hereditary material hershey shared the 1969 nobel prize in physiology or medicine with max delbr ck and salvador luria for their discoveries concerning the genetic structure of viruses in the early twentieth century biologists thought that proteins carried genetic information this was based on the belief that proteins were more complex than dna phoebus levene s influential tetranucleotide hypothesis which incorrectly proposed that dna was a repeating set of identical nucleotides supported this conclusion the results of the avery macleod mccarty experiment published in 1944 suggested that dna was the genetic material but there was still some hesitation within the general scientific community to accept this

thus square integrability on the real line formula 2 is defined as follows one may also speak of quadratic integrability over bounded intervals such as formula 3 for formula 4 an equivalent definition is to say that the square of the function itself rather than of its absolute value is lebesgue integrable for this to be true the integrals of the positive and negative portions of the real part must both be finite as well as those for the imaginary part the vector space of square integrable functions with respect to lebesgue measure form the l space with formula 5 among the l spaces the class of square integrable functions is unique in being compatible with an inner product which allows notions like angle and orthogonality to be defined along with this inner product the square integrable functions form a hilbert space since all of the l spaces are complete under their respective p norms often the term is used not to refer to a specific function but to equivalence classes of functions that are equal almost everywhere the square integrable functions in the sense mentioned in which a function actually means an equivalence class of functions that are equal

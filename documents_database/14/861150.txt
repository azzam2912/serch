the napierian logarithms were published first in 1614 henry briggs introduced common base 10 logarithms which were easier to use tables of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries the idea of logarithms was also used to construct the slide rule which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s a breakthrough generating the natural logarithm was the result of a search for an expression of area against a rectangular hyperbola and required the assimilation of a new function into standard mathematics as the common log of ten is one of a hundred is two and a thousand is three the concept of common logarithms is very close to the decimal positional number system the common log is said to have base 10 but base 10 000 is ancient and still common in east asia in his book the sand reckoner archimedes used the myriad as the base of a number system designed to count the grains of sand in the universe as was noted in 2000 in 1616 henry briggs visited napier at edinburgh in order to discuss the suggested change to napier s logarithms the following year he again visited for a similar purpose during

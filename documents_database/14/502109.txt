this set of models is often referred to collectively as sgp4 due to the frequency of use of that model particularly with two line element sets produced by norad and nasa these models predict the effect of perturbations caused by the earth s shape drag radiation and gravitation effects from other bodies such as the sun and moon simplified general perturbations sgp models apply to near earth objects with an orbital period of less than 225 minutes simplified deep space perturbations sdp models apply to objects with an orbital period greater than 225 minutes which corresponds to an altitude of 5 877 5 km assuming a circular orbit the sgp4 and sdp4 models were published along with sample code in fortran iv in 1988 with refinements over the original model to handle the larger number of objects in orbit since sgp8 sdp8 introduced additional improvements for handling orbital decay the sgp4 model has an error 1 km at epoch and grows at 1 3 km per day this data is updated frequently in nasa and norad sources due to this error the original sgp model was developed by kozai in 1959 refined by hilton kuhlman in 1966 and was originally

it resembles nodaviruses family nodaviridae but has yet to be formally classified orsay virus has a ssrna genome consisting of two segments termed rna1 and rna2 the rna1 segment encodes an rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp of 982 amino acids the rna2 segment has two open reading frames orfs that code for a capsid protein and a non structural protein with unknown function the virus is composed of two structural domains a shell s and a protrusion p domain the orsay virus was discovered in 2011 in caenorhabditis elegans nematodes in rotting fruit in orsay france just before the time of the discovery standardized methods were developed for the wild isolation of nematodes using these methods caenorhabditis briggsae and c elegans nematodes were found that displayed abnormalities in the intestines such as extensive convolutions of the apical intestinal border the lysate of infected nematodes was added to healthy nematodes which led to infection since for the lysate a filter was used that only allows virus particles to penetrate this suggested that a virus was the cause of the intestinal abnormalities electron microscopy showing viral particles confirmed the role of a virus on infection of a susceptible nematode the viral particles

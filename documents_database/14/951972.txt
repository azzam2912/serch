usually r is 2 or 3 i e the n x r matrix x lists points in 2 or 3 dimensional euclidean space so that the result may be visualised i e an mds plot the function formula 2 is a cost or loss function that measures the squared differences between ideal formula 3 dimensional distances and actual distances in r dimensional space it is defined as where formula 5 is a weight for the measurement between a pair of points formula 6 formula 7 is the euclidean distance between formula 8 and formula 9 and formula 10 is the ideal distance between the points their separation in the formula 3 dimensional data space note that formula 12 can be used to specify a degree of confidence in the similarity between points e g 0 can be specified if there is no information for a particular pair a configuration formula 13 which minimizes formula 1 gives a plot in which points that are close together correspond to points that are also close together in the original formula 3 dimensional data space there are many ways that formula 16 could be minimized for example kruskal recommended an iterative steepest descent approach

the cementum is the part of the periodontium that attaches the teeth to the alveolar bone by anchoring the periodontal ligament the cells of cementum are the entrapped cementoblasts the cementocytes each cementocyte lies in its similar to the pattern noted in bone these lacunae also have canaliculi or canals unlike those in bone however these canals in cementum do not contain nerves nor do they radiate outward instead the canals are oriented toward the periodontal ligament and contain cementocytic processes that exist to diffuse nutrients from the ligament because it is vascularized after the apposition of cementum in layers the cementoblasts that do not become entrapped in cementum line up along the cemental surface along the length of the outer covering of the periodontal ligament these cementoblasts can form subsequent layers of cementum if the tooth is injured sharpey fibers are part of the principal collagenous fibers of the periodontal ligament embedded in the cementum and alveolar bone to attach the tooth to the alveolus the cementum joins the enamel to form the cementoenamel junction cej which is referred to as the cervical line three possible types of transitional interfaces may be present at the cej the traditional view

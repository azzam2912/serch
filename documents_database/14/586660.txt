the chemical reaction catalyzed by enolase is enolase belongs to the family of lyases specifically the hydro lyases which cleave carbon oxygen bonds the systematic name of this enzyme is 2 phospho d glycerate hydro lyase phosphoenolpyruvate forming the reaction is reversible depending on environmental concentrations of substrates the optimum ph for the human enzyme is 6 5 enolase is present in all tissues and organisms capable of glycolysis or fermentation the enzyme was discovered by lohmann and meyerhof in 1934 and has since been isolated from a variety of sources including human muscle and erythrocytes in humans deficiency of eno1 is linked to hereditary haemolytic anemia while eno3 deficiency is linked to glycogen storage disease type x in humans there are three subunits of enolase and each encoded by a separate gene that can combine to form five different isoenzymes and three of these isoenzymes all homodimers are more commonly found in adult human cells than the others when present in the same cell different isozymes readily form heterodimers enolase is a member of the large enolase superfamily it has a molecular weight of 82 000 100 000 daltons depending on the isoform in human alpha enolase the two

before an animal can be used for intravital microscopy imaging it has to undergo a surgery involving implantation of an imaging window for example if researchers want to visualize liver cells of a live mouse they will implant an imaging window into mouse s abdomen mice are the most common choice of animals for intravital microscopy but in special cases other rodents such as rats might be more suitable animals are always anesthetized throughout surgeries and imaging sessions intravital microscopy is used in several areas of research including neurology immunology stem cell and others this technique is particularly useful to assess a progression of a disease or an effect of a drug intravital microscopy involves imaging cells of a live animal through an imaging window that is implanted into the animal tissue during a special surgery the main advantage of intravital microscopy is that it allows imaging living cells while they are in the true environment of a complex multicellular organism thus intravital microscopy allows researchers to study the behavior of cells in their natural environment or in vivo rather than in a cell culture another advantage of intravital microscopy is that the experiment can be set up in a

it was invented by the german physiologist hermann von helmholtz in 1851 although an earlier model was developed in 1796 by jesse ramsden and everard home a keratometer uses the relationship between object size o image size i the distance between the reflective surface and the object d and the radius of the reflective surface r if three of these variables are known or fixed the fourth can be calculated using the formula there are two distinct variants of determining r javal schiotz type keratometers have a fixed image size and are typically two position whereas bausch and lomb type keratometers have a fixed object size and are usually one position the javal schiotz keratometer is a two position instrument which uses a fixed image and doubling size and adjustable object size to determine the radius of curvature of the reflective surface it uses two self illuminated mires the object one a red square the other a green staircase design which are held on a circumferential track in order to maintain a fixed distance from the eye in order to get repeatable accurate measurements it is important that the instrument stays focused it uses the scheiner principle common in autofocus

by contrast static timing analysis computes the delays of entire paths using delay calculation to determine the delay of each gate and wire there are many methods used for delay calculation for the gate itself the choice depends primarily on the speed and accuracy required similarly there are many ways to calculate the delay of a wire the delay of a wire will normally be different for each destination in order of increasing accuracy and decreasing speed the most common methods are often it makes sense to combine the calculation of a gate and all the wire connected to its output this combination is often called the stage delay the delay of a wire or gate may also depend on the behaviour of the nearby components this is one of the main effects that is analyzed during signal integrity checks in the context of semi custom digital design pre characterized digital information is often abstracted in the form of the above mentioned 2 d look up table lut the idea behind semi custom design method is to use blocks of pre built and tested components to build something larger say a chip in this context the blocks are logic gates

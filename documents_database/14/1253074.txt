the theorem was obtained by alexander kurosh a russian mathematician in 1934 informally the theorem says that every subgroup of a free product is itself a free product of a free group and of its intersections with the conjugates of the factors of the original free product after the original 1934 proof of kurosh there were many subsequent proofs of the kurosh subgroup theorem including proofs of harold w kuhn 1952 saunders mac lane 1958 and others the theorem was also generalized for describing subgroups of amalgamated free products and hnn extensions other generalizations include considering subgroups of free pro finite products and a version of the kurosh subgroup theorem for topological groups in modern terms the kurosh subgroup theorem is a straightforward corollary of the basic structural results of bass serre theory about groups acting on trees let g a b be the free product of groups a and b and let h g be a subgroup of g then there exist a family a of subgroups a a a family b of subgroups b b families g i i and f j j of elements of g and a subset x g such that this means that x

p waves travel faster than other seismic waves and hence are the first signal from an earthquake to arrive at any affected location or at a seismograph p waves may be transmitted through gases liquids or solids the name p wave can stand for either pressure wave as it is formed from alternating compressions and rarefactions or primary wave as it has high velocity and is therefore the first wave to be recorded by a seismograph primary and secondary waves are body waves that travel within the earth the motion and behavior of both p type and s type in the earth are monitored to probe the interior structure of the earth discontinuities in velocity as a function of depth are indicative of changes in phase or composition differences in arrival times of waves originating in a seismic event like an earthquake as a result of waves taking different paths allow mapping of the earth s inner structure almost all the information available on the structure of the earth s deep interior is derived from observations of the travel times reflections refractions and phase transitions of seismic body waves or normal modes p waves travel through the fluid layers of

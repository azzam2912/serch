when the filesystem is idle for a few seconds it marks these as safe points the product allows the disk drive to be restored to any point within the available history it also allows older versions of files to be restored and previous versions of the whole disk to be browsed depending on disk activity the typical history might cover a few hours to a few days goback replaces the master boot record and also replaces the partition table with a single partition this allows a hard drive to be changed back even in the event that the operating system is unable to boot while also protecting the filesystem from alteration so that the revert information remains correct goback is compatible with hardware raid drives due to the changes made to the partition table this can cause problems when dual booting other operating systems on the same hard disk it is possible to retain dual boot compatibility but can involve saving the partition table before enabling goback and after enabling goback re writing the partition table back to the disk after booting from a different device such as a live cd it may also be necessary to disable goback prior

the four criteria all influence the drug levels and kinetics of drug exposure to the tissues and hence influence the performance and pharmacological activity of the compound as a drug sometimes liberation and or toxicity are also considered yielding ladme admet or ladmet for a compound to reach a tissue it usually must be taken into the bloodstream often via mucous surfaces like the digestive tract intestinal absorption before being taken up by the target cells factors such as poor compound solubility gastric emptying time intestinal transit time chemical instability in the stomach and inability to permeate the intestinal wall can all reduce the extent to which a drug is absorbed after oral administration absorption critically determines the compound s bioavailability drugs that absorb poorly when taken orally must be administered in some less desirable way like intravenously or by inhalation e g zanamivir routes of administration are an important consideration the compound needs to be carried to its effector site most often via the bloodstream from there the compound may distribute into muscle and organs usually to differing extents after entry into the systemic circulation either by intravascular injection or by absorption from any of the various extracellular sites

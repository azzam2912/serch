it is an alternative to akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic it is given as where formula 2 is the log likelihood k is the number of parameters and n is the number of observations burnham anderson 2002 p 287 say that hqc while often cited seems to have seen little use in practice they also note that hqc like bic but unlike aic is not an estimator of kullback leibler divergence claeskens hjort 2008 ch 4 note that hqc like bic but unlike aic is not asymptotically efficient however it misses the optimal estimation rate by a very small formula 3 factor they further point out that whatever method is being used for fine tuning the criterion will be more important in practice than the term formula 3 since this latter number is small even for very large formula 5 however the formula 3 term ensures that unlike aic hqc is strongly consistent it follows from the law of the iterated logarithm that any strongly consistent method must miss efficiency by at least a formula 3 factor so in this sense hqc is asymptotically very well behaved van der pas and gr nwald prove that model

based upon an annual parallax shift of 68 22 mas as seen from earth it is located approximately 47 8 light years from the sun this system came closest approach to the sun about 585 000 years ago when it made perihelion passage at an estimated distance of psi serpentis is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 5 84 this system can be resolved into two components that orbit each other with a period of 528 79 years and an eccentricity of 0 146 the primary component a is a yellow hued g type main sequence star with a stellar classification of g5 v it is a solar analog but its physical properties differ enough from the sun to not be considered a solar twin the star has an estimated 99 3 of the mass of the sun and it matches the sun s radius within the margin of error it is radiating 98 of the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5 683 k when observed from 1997 through 2000 the primary component appeared to be transitioning from a maunder minimum state to a state of cycling magnetic activity

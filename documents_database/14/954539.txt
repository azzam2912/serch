a subset of fingerprint impressions acquired with various sensors was provided to registered participants to allow them to adjust the parameters of their algorithms participants were requested to provide enroll and match executable files of their algorithms the evaluation was conducted at the organizers facilities using the submitted executable files on a sequestered database acquired with the same sensors as the training set the organizers of fvc are each participant can submit up to one algorithm to the open and light categories the first second and third international competitions on fingerprint verification fvc2000 fvc2002 and fvc2004 were organized in 2000 2002 and 2004 respectively these events received great attention both from academic and industrial biometric communities they established a common benchmark allowing developers to unambiguously compare their algorithms and provided an overview of the state of the art in fingerprint recognition based on the response of the biometrics community fvc2000 fvc2002 and fvc2004 were undoubtedly successful initiatives the interest shown in previous editions by the biometrics research community has prompted the organizers to schedule a new competition for the year 2006 in 2006 there were one of the most important and time consuming tasks of any biometric system evaluation is

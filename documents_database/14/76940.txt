the individual components remain separate and distinct within the finished structure differentiating composites from mixtures and solid solutions the new material may be preferred for many reasons common examples include materials which are stronger lighter or less expensive when compared to traditional materials more recently researchers have also begun to actively include sensing actuation computation and communication into composites which are known as robotic materials typical engineered composite materials include composite materials are generally used for buildings bridges and structures such as boat hulls swimming pool panels racing car bodies shower stalls bathtubs storage tanks imitation granite and cultured marble sinks and countertops the most advanced examples perform routinely on spacecraft and aircraft in demanding environments the earliest synthetic composite materials were straw and mud combined to form bricks for building construction ancient brick making was documented by egyptian tomb paintings wattle and daub is one of the oldest synthetic composite materials at over 6000 years old concrete is also a composite material and is used more than any other synthetic material in the world about 7 5 billion cubic metres of concrete are made each year more than one cubic metre for every person on earth concrete is the

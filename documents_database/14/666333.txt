asymmetric induction is a key element in asymmetric synthesis asymmetric induction was introduced by hermann emil fischer based on his work on carbohydrates several types of induction exist internal asymmetric induction makes use of a chiral center bound to the reactive center through a covalent bond and remains so during the reaction the starting material is often derived from chiral pool synthesis in relayed asymmetric induction the chiral information is introduced in a separate step and removed again in a separate chemical reaction special synthons are called chiral auxiliaries in external asymmetric induction chiral information is introduced in the transition state through a catalyst of chiral ligand this method of asymmetric synthesis is economically most desirable several models exist to describe chiral induction at carbonyl carbons during nucleophilic additions these models are based on a combination of steric and electronic considerations and are often in conflict with each other models have been devised by cram 1952 cornforth 1959 felkin 1969 and others the cram s rule of asymmetric induction developed by donald j cram in 1952 is an early concept relating to the prediction of stereochemistry in certain acyclic systems in full the rule is in certain non catalytic reactions

the technical feasibility of the ground carriage is being investigated by two research groups in 2013 iata included the technology into their technology roadmap airbus pursues the concept as part of its future by airbus strategy the aircraft installed landing gear and related structures and systems account for 6 to 15 per cent of the empty weight of an aircraft but it is only required on the ground for takeoff and landing as well as for taxiing and parking during cruise flight it is carried along as unused ballast an aircraft without landing gear could therefore require 8 to 20 per cent less fuel in flight furthermore landing gears are one of the most expensive aircraft systems and complex in operation and maintenance finally less noise is emitted when the drag of the undercarriage is omitted during approach and the engines are switched off while taxiing on ground a ground carriage provides the means for an aircraft to takeoff and land without carrying an own aircraft installed landing gear instead the aircraft is equipped with much lighter interfaces which connect to the ground carriage every airport approached by aircraft without landing gear must operate at least one ground carriage in

the dutch geodesist snellius 1620 repeated the experiment between alkmaar and bergen op zoom using more modern geodetic instrumentation later grade measurements aimed at determining the flattening of the earth ellipsoid by measuring at different geographic latitudes the first of these was the one commissioned by the french academy of sciences in 1735 1738 involving measurement expeditions to lapland maupertuis et al and peru pierre bouguer et al later struve measured a geodetic triangle chain between the arctic sea and the black sea and bessel compiled several meridian arcs to compute the famous bessel ellipsoid 1841 nowadays the method is replaced by worldwide geodetic networks and by satellite geodesy also the imaginary grade measurement described by jules verne in his book adventures of 3 russians and 3 englishmen in south africa of 1872 may be mentioned

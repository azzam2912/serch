it is an example of a hypervalent compound the molecular shape is trigonal bipyramid pentamethylbismuth is produced in a two step process first trimethylbismuth is reacted with sulfuryl chloride to yield dichloro trimethylbismuth which is then reacted with twice as much methyllithium dissolved in ether the blue solution is cooled to 110 c to precipitate the solid product at 110 c bi ch is a blue violet solid the methyl groups are arranged in a trigonal bipyramid and the bond lengths of methyl with bismuth are all the same however the molecule is not rigid as can be determined from the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum that shows all methyl groups are equivalent it is stable as a solid but in the gas phase when heated or in solution decomposes to trimethylbismuth the colour is unusual for bismuth or other hypervalent pnictide compounds which are colourless calculations show that the colour is due to homo lumo transition the homo is ligand based whereas the lumo is modified by relativistically stabilised bismuth 6s orbitals if excess methyllithium is used in production an orange hexamethylbismuth salt libi ch is formed this is unusual as very few elements can form bonds with six organic

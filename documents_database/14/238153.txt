it has an apparent visual magnitude of 3 56 making it a fourth magnitude star that is visible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere parallax measurements from the hipparcos satellite yield an estimated distance of from earth this makes it one of the nearest bright stars to the solar system it is a subgiant of spectral type g8 iv it will stop fusing hydrogen relatively soon starting the process of becoming a red giant hence delta pavonis is 22 brighter than the sun but the effective temperature of its outer atmosphere is less 5 604 k its mass is 99 1 of sol s mass with a mean radius 122 of sol s radius delta pavonis s surface convection zone extends downward to about 43 1 of the star s radius but only contains 4 8 of the star s mass spectroscopic examination of delta pavonis shows that it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than helium metallicity than does the sun this value is typically given in terms of the ratio of iron chemical symbol fe to hydrogen h in a star s atmosphere relative to that in sol s atmosphere iron being a good proxy

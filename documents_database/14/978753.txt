it involves fixed flexion deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joints the fifth finger is always affected camptodactyly can be caused by a genetic disorder in that case it is an autosomal dominant trait that is known for its incomplete genetic expressivity this means that when a person has the genes for it the condition may appear in both hands one or neither a linkage scan proposed that the chromosomal locus of camptodactyly was 3q11 2 q13 12 the specific cause of camptodactyly remains unknown but there are a few deficiencies that lead to the condition a deficient lumbrical muscle controlling the flexion of the fingers and abnormalities of the flexor and extensor tendons a number of congenital syndromes may also cause camptodactyly the pattern of inheritance is determined by the phenotypic expression of a gene which is called expressivity camptodactyly can be passed on through generations in various levels of phenotypic expression which include both or only one hand this means that the genetic expressivity is incomplete it can be inherited from either parent in most of its cases camptodactyly occurs sporadically but it has been found in several studies that it is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition if

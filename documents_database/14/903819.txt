a variety of unrelated structural domains have been shown to exhibit guanine nucleotide exchange activity some gefs can activate multiple gtpases while others are specific to a single gtpase guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs are proteins or protein domains involved in the activation of small gtpases small gtpases act as molecular switches in intracellular signaling pathways and have many downstream targets the most well known gtpases comprise the ras superfamily and are involved in essential cell processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation cytoskeletal organization vesicle trafficking and nuclear transport gtpases are active when bound to gtp and inactive when bound to gdp allowing their activity to be regulated by gefs and the opposing gtpase activating proteins gaps gdp dissociates from inactive gtpases very slowly the binding of gefs to their gtpase substrates catalyzes the dissociation of gdp allowing a gtp molecule to bind in its place gefs function to promote the dissociation of gdp after gdp has disassociated from the gtpase gtp generally binds in its place as the cytosolic ratio of gtp is much higher than gdp at 10 1 the binding of gtp to the gtpase results in the release of the gef which can then activate

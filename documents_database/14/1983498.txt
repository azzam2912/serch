this process is used as a method for analyzing dna and it is also the basis of certain kinds of poisoning there are several ways molecules in this case also known as ligands can interact with dna ligands may interact with dna by covalently binding electrostatically binding or intercalating intercalation occurs when ligands of an appropriate size and chemical nature fit themselves in between base pairs of dna these ligands are mostly polycyclic aromatic and planar and therefore often make good nucleic acid stains intensively studied dna intercalators include berberine ethidium bromide proflavine daunomycin doxorubicin and thalidomide dna intercalators are used in chemotherapeutic treatment to inhibit dna replication in rapidly growing cancer cells examples include doxorubicin adriamycin and daunorubicin both of which are used in treatment of hodgkin s lymphoma and dactinomycin used in wilm s tumour ewing s sarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma metallointercalators are complexes of a metal cation with polycyclic aromatic ligands the most commonly used metal ion is ruthenium ii because its complexes are very slow to decompose in the biological environment other metallic cations that have been used include rhodium iii and iridium iii typical ligands attached to the metal ion are dipyridine and terpyridine whose planar structure

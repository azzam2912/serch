rp cars takes advantage of polarization dependent selection rules in order to gain information about molecule orientation anisotropy and direction within the optical point spread function coherent anti stokes raman spectroscopy cars is a non linear process in which the energy difference of a pair of incoming photons matches the energy of the vibrational mode of a molecular bond of interest this phonon population is coherently probed by a third photon and anti stokes radiation is emitted in presence of molecular orientation anisotropy in the sample cars images often display artefacts due to polarization dependent selection rules that affects the measured intensity with respect of the alignment between the polarization plane of the incident light and the main orientation plane of the molecular bonds this is due because the four wave mixing process is more efficient when the polarization plane of the incident light is aligned with the main orientation plane of the molecular vibrations rp cars takes advantage of the polarization dependent selection rules to detect the local microscopic orientation of the chemical bonds under investigation by means of rp cars it is possible to visualize the degree of orientation anisotropy of selected molecular bonds and to detect their

the name of the switching lemma stems from the following observation take an arbitrary formula in conjunctive normal form which is in particular a depth 2 circuit now the switching lemma guarantees that after setting some variables randomly we end up with a boolean function that depends only on few variables i e it can be computed by a decision tree of some small depth formula 2 this allows us to write the restricted function as a small formula in disjunctive normal form a formula in conjunctive normal form hit by a random restriction of the variables can therefore be switched to a small formula in disjunctive normal form the original proof of the switching lemma involves an argument with conditional probabilities arguably simpler proofs have been subsequently given by and for an introduction see chapter 14 in

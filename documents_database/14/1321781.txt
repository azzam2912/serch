the radar was developed and successfully tested between 1949 and 1950 demonstrating a detection range of 150 km against a target aircraft at 8 km altitude and was accepted into operational service the p 8 was developed by the skb design bureau a division of state plant no 197 named after v i lenin who developed the previous p 3 the predecessor of the current nizhniy novgorod research institute of radio engineering nniirt the development of the p 8 radar won the team responsible for its introduction the state prize in 1951 the p 8 radar underwent a significant modification which boosted the detection range to 250 km against a target flying at an altitude of 10 km the target detection range of low altitude targets was also improved by a factor of 60 70 between 1956 and 1957 the p 10 and legacy p 8 radar were equipped with improved clutter suppression equipment allowing for cancellation of clutter moving up to 30 m s cancellation was improved by a factor of 5 compared with no cancellation the p 8 being a development of the earlier p 3 shares many similarities with the earlier system like the p 3m mobile

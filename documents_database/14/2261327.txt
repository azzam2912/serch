the microbial biomass blocks the pathway of water in the pore space forming a certain thickness of impermeable layer in soil and it reduces the rate of infiltration of water remarkably bioclogging is observed under continuous ponded infiltration at various field conditions such as artificial recharge ponds percolation trench irrigation channel sewage treatment system and landfill liner it also affects groundwater flow in aquifer such as permeable reactive barrier and microbial enhanced oil recovery in the situation where infiltration of water at appropriate rate is needed bioclogging can be problematic and countermeasures such as regular drying of the system are taken in some cases bioclogging can be utilized to make impermeable layer to minimize the rate of infiltration bioclogging is observed as the decrease of the infiltration rate decrease in the infiltration rate under ponded infiltration was observed in 1940s for studying the infiltration of artificial recharge pond and the water spreading on agricultural soils when soils are continuously submerged permeability or saturated hydraulic conductivity changes in 3 stages which was explained as follows the 3 stages are not necessarily distinct in every field condition of bioclogging when the second stage is not clear permeability just continues to decrease the

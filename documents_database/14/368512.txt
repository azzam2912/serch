its main function is to induce uterine contractions the myometrium is located between the endometrium the inner layer of the uterine wall and the serosa or perimetrium the outer uterine layer myometrium has 3 layers outer longitudinal smooth muscles middle crisscrossing figure of eight muscle fibres and inner circular fibres middle crisscross fibres act as living ligature during involution of the uterus and prevent blood loss the inner one third of the myometrium termed the junctional or sub endometrial layer appears to be derived from the m llerian duct while the outer more predominant layer of the myometrium appears to originate from non m llerian tissue and is the major contractile tissue during parturition and abortion the junctional layer appears to function like a circular muscle layer capable of peristaltic and anti peristaltic activity equivalent to the muscular layer of the intestines the molecular structure of the smooth muscle of myometrium is very similar to that of smooth muscle in other sites of the body with myosin and actin being the predominant proteins in uterine smooth muscle there is approximately 6 fold more actin than myosin a shift in the myosin expression of the uterine smooth muscle may be responsible

low level enzootic transmission is likely continuing in the epidemic zone and with increased deforestation and population expansion additional epidemics caused by rocio virus are highly probable if migratory species of birds are or become involved in the virus transmission cycle the competency of a wide variety of mosquito species for transmitting rocio virus experimentally suggest that the virus may become more widely distributed the encephalitis outbreak in the western hemisphere caused by west nile virus a related flavivirus highlights the potential for arboviruses to cause severe problems far from their source enzootic foci the causative rocio virus belongs to the genus flavivirus the same genus as the zika virus in family flaviviridae and is closely related serologically to ilh us st louis encephalitis japanese encephalitis and murray valley encephalitis viruses during 1975 and 1976 rocio virus was responsible for several epidemics of meningoencephalitis in coastal communities in southern s o paulo brazil the outbreaks affected over 1 000 people and killed about 10 of those infected but apparently responded well to treatment for viral encephalitides the disease progresses rapidly after onset with patients dying within 5 days of symptoms first appearing the disease first presents with fever headache vomiting

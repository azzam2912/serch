data recording and readback are achieved by focusing lasers within the medium however because of the volumetric nature of the data structure the laser light must travel through other data points before it reaches the point where reading or recording is desired therefore some kind of nonlinearity is required to ensure that these other data points do not interfere with the addressing of the desired point no commercial product based on 3doptical data storage has yet arrived on the mass market although several companies are actively developing the technology and claim that it may become available soon the 3d aspect of this is what is holding it back as 3d is becomming less used in modern life current optical data storage media such as the cd and dvd store data as a series of reflective marks on an internal surface of a disc in order to increase storage capacity it is possible for discs to hold two or even more of these data layers but their number is severely limited since the addressing laser interacts with every layer that it passes through on the way to and from the addressed layer these interactions cause noise that limits the technology to

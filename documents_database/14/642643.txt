it has been proposed as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine accumulation of greenhouse gases which are released by burning fossil fuels carbon dioxide is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological chemical and physical processes artificial processes have been devised to produce similar effects including large scale artificial capture and sequestration of industrially produced using subsurface saline aquifers reservoirs ocean water aging oil fields or other carbon sinks carbon sequestration is the process involved in carbon capture and the long term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide and may refer specifically to carbon dioxide may be captured as a pure by product in processes related to petroleum refining or from flue gases from power generation sequestration includes the storage part of carbon capture and storage which refers to large scale artificial capture and sequestration of industrially produced using subsurface saline aquifers reservoirs ocean water aging oil fields or other carbon sinks carbon sequestration describes long term storage of carbon dioxide or other forms of carbon to either mitigate or defer global warming and avoid dangerous climate change it has been proposed as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine accumulation of greenhouse gases which are released by

it is notable as the location of one of the largest central galactic black holes in the known universe which has also apparently produced the most powerful active galactic nucleus eruption ever discovered since the big bang using data from the chandra space telescope scientists have deduced that an eruption has been occurring for the last 100 million years at the heart of the galaxy cluster releasing as much energy over this time as hundreds of millions of gamma ray bursts the amount of energy released in a year is thus equivalent to several grbs the remnants of the eruption are seen as two cavities on either side of a large central galaxy if this outburst with a total energy budget of more than 10 j was caused by a black hole accretion event it must have consumed nearly 600 million solar masses work done by brian mcnamara et al 2008 point out the striking possibility that the outburst was not the result of an accretion event but was instead powered by the rotation of the black hole moreover the scientists mentioned the possibility that the central black hole in ms 0735 6 7421 could be one of the biggest

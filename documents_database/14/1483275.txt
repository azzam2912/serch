it completes one orbit around the sun in just over 247 earth years at an average distance of about 44 au it came to perihelion around 1868 and to aphelion in 2015 it is currently about 50 7 au from the sun and will again return to perihelion around 2163 has been observed 70 times with precovery images dating back to 2006 and has an orbital quality code of 4 the size of an object can be ascertained once its absolute magnitude h and its albedo the proportion of light it reflects are known when was first discovered it was believed to have an absolute magnitude h of 2 8 which would have made it the first bright kbo found from the southern hemisphere has an absolute magnitude h of 4 5 since has an absolute magnitude dimmer than h 1 it will not be overseen by two naming committees and will not automatically be listed as a dwarf planet by the international astronomical union iau this value would ve made it the eighth intrinsically brightest known trans neptunian object but it was later found to be much dimmer it has an absolute magnitude h of 4 5 which would

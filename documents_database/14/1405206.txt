butcher by is an infinite dimensional lie group first introduced in numerical analysis to study solutions of non linear ordinary differential equations by the runge kutta method it arose from an algebraic formalism involving rooted trees that provides formal power series solutions of the differential equation modeling the flow of a vector field it was prompted by the work of sylvester on change of variables in differential calculus who first noted that the derivatives of a composition of functions can be conveniently expressed in terms of rooted trees and their combinatorics a rooted tree is a graph with a distinguished node called the root in which every other node is connected to the root by a unique path if the root of a tree t is removed and the nodes connected to the original node by a single bond are taken as new roots the tree t breaks up into rooted trees t t reversing this process a new tree t t t can be constructed by joining the roots of the trees to a new common root the number of nodes in a tree is denoted by t a heap ordering of a rooted tree t is an allocation

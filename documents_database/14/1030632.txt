thought of as deformations of elasto plastic bodies functions of bounded deformation play a major role in the mathematical study of materials e g the francfort marigo model of brittle crack evolution more precisely given an open subset of r a function u r is said to be of bounded deformation if the symmetrized gradient u of u is a bounded symmetric n n matrix valued radon measure the collection of all functions of bounded deformation is denoted bd r or simply bd introduced essentially by p m suquet in 1978 bd is a strictly larger space than the space bv of functions of bounded variation one can show that if u is of bounded deformation then the measure u can be decomposed into three parts one absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure denoted e u d x a jump part supported on a rectifiable n 1 dimensional set j of points where u has two different approximate limits u and u together with a normal vector and a cantor part which vanishes on borel sets of finite h measure where h denotes k dimensional hausdorff measure a function u is said to be of special bounded deformation if

they respond to pathogens and injury by changing morphology and migrating to the site of infection injury where they destroy pathogens and remove damaged cells as part of their response they secrete cytokines chemokines prostaglandins and reactive oxygen species which help to direct the immune response additionally they are instrumental in the resolution of the inflammatory response through the production of anti inflammatory cytokines microglia have also been extensively studied for their harmful roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer s disease parkinson s disease multiple sclerosis as well as cardiac diseases glaucoma and viral and bacterial infections the word neuroinflammation has come to stand for chronic central nervous system cns specific inflammation like glial responses that may produce neurodegenerative symptoms such as plaque formation dystrophic neurite growth and excessive tau phosphorylation it is important to distinguish between acute and chronic neuroinflammation acute neuroinflammation is generally caused by some neuronal injury after which microglia migrate to the injured site engulfing dead cells and debris the term neuroinflammation generally refers to more chronic sustained injury when the responses of microglial cells contribute to and expand the neurodestructive effects worsening the disease process when microglia are activated they take on an amoeboid

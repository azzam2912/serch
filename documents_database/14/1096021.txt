it was established in 1992 to provide an inter face for interactive research in neurobiology physics and applied physics computer science and psychophysics with the objective of increasing the understanding of how the brain works with specific focus on computational aspects of the nervous system the center has facilities for studying and modeling the nervous system at its different levels from single neuron computation to signal processing in small and large cortical networks to the system and the behavioral level this is backed up by 26 faculty members the icnc groups work together using experimental and theoretical approaches ranging from molecular techniques in vitro intracellular using dic video microscopy and imaging methods with voltage dependent dyes in vivo multi unit recordings in behaving animals and imaging techniques using fmri theoretical approaches include cable and compartmental modeling information and learning theory statistical mechanics and techniques from signal processing theory a number of research centers in europe usa and japan are now following the model established by the icnc including the institute for neuroinformatics eth univ z rich laboratories de neurophysique univ paris v paris the gatsby computational neuroscience unit ucl london each of whom have sent missions to icnc the icnc

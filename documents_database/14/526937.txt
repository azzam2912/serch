it is an unstable structural isomer of nitrate although its conjugate acid is highly reactive peroxynitrite is stable in basic solutions it is prepared by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with nitrite peroxynitrite is an oxidant and nitrating agent because of its oxidizing properties peroxynitrite can damage a wide array of molecules in cells including dna and proteins formation of peroxynitrite in vivo has been ascribed to the reaction of the free radical superoxide with the free radical nitric oxide the resultant pairing of these two free radicals results in peroxynitrite a molecule that is itself not a free radical but that is a powerful oxidant in the laboratory a solution of peroxynitrite can be prepared by treating acidified hydrogen peroxide with a solution of sodium nitrite followed by rapid addition of naoh its concentration is indicated by the absorbance at 302 nm ph 12 1670 m cm onoo reacts nucleophilically with carbon dioxide in vivo the concentration of carbon dioxide is about 1 mm and its reaction with onoo occurs quickly thus under physiological conditions the reaction of onoo with carbon dioxide to form nitrosoperoxycarbonate is by far the predominant pathway for onoo homolyzes to form carbonate radical and

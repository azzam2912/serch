in comparison with radiation burns caused by ionizing radiation where the dominant mechanism of tissue damage is internal cell damage caused by free radicals the primary damage mechanism of microwave radiation is by heat microwave damage can manifest with a delay pain or signs of skin damage can show some time after microwave exposure the depth of penetration depends on the frequency of the microwaves and the tissue type the active denial system pain ray is a less lethal directed energy weapon that employs a microwave beam at 95 ghz a two second burst of the 95 ghz focused beam heats the skin to a temperature of 130 f 54 c at a depth of 1 64th of an inch 0 4 mm and is claimed to cause skin pain without lasting damage conversely lower frequencies penetrate deeper at 5 8 ghz 3 2 mm the depth most of the energy is dissipated in the first millimeter of the skin the 2 45 ghz frequency microwaves commonly used in microwave ovens can deliver energy deeper into the tissue the generally accepted value is 17 mm for muscle tissue as lower frequencies penetrate deeper into the tissue and as there are

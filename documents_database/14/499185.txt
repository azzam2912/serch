power reactors are generally classified by the type of coolant rather than by the configuration of the reactor vessel used to contain the coolant the classifications are of the main classes of reactor with a pressure vessel the pressurized water reactor is unique in that the pressure vessel suffers significant neutron irradiation called fluence during operation and may become brittle over time as a result in particular the larger pressure vessel of the boiling water reactor is better shielded from the neutron flux so although more expensive to manufacture in the first place because of this extra size it has an advantage in not needing annealing to extend its life annealing of pressurized water reactor vessels to extend their working life is a complex and high value technology being actively developed by both nuclear service providers areva and operators of pressurized water reactors all pressurized water reactor pressure vessels share some features regardless of the particular design the reactor vessel body is the largest component and is designed to contain the fuel assembly coolant and fittings to support coolant flow and support structures it is usually cylindrical in shape and is open at the top to allow the fuel to

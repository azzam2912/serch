all are brown solids which are soluble in acetic acid and water these compounds are used in organic synthesis as oxidizing agents compounds with the formula mn occh have not been verified instead manganese iii acetate adopts the structure reminiscent of those of basic chromium acetate and basic iron acetate for this reason manganese iii acetate is sometimes referred to as basic manganese acetate the formula is mno occh l x where l is a ligand and x is an anion the coordination polymer mno occh occhhocch has been crystallized it is usually used as the dihydrate although the anhydrous form is also used in some situations the dihydrate is prepared by combining potassium permanganate and manganese ii acetate in acetic acid addition of acetic anhydride to the reaction produces the anhydrous form it is also synthesized by electrochemical method starting from mn oac manganese triacetate has been used as a single electron oxidant it can oxidize alkenes via addition of acetic acid to form lactones this process is thought to proceed via the formation of a chcoh radical intermediate which then reacts with the alkene followed by additional oxidation steps and finally ring closure when the alkene is not

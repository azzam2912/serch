the intent was to develop an aircraft bomb which was high yield up to over 100 kilotons and yet was small enough and had low enough drag to carry under the wing of a fighter or fighter bomber type aircraft one major feature was full fuzing options allowing various air and ground burst usage options free fall air burst parachute retarded air burst free fall ground burst parachute retarded ground burst and laydown or parachute retarded time delay after impact ground burst the b61 project started in 1960 with a study contract analyzing the potential of such a weapon the official development program was funded in 1961 and the weapon was designated tx 61 test experimental in 1963 the first tx 61 free fall ballistic test was held at tonopah test range on august 20 1963 the first war reserve b61 0 was accepted by the aec on december 21 1966 the original models of b61 used pbx 9404 hmx based plastic bonded explosive to implode the fissile material in the primary stage newer models use tatb based pbx 9502 which is an insensitive high explosive ihe and will not detonate due to fire shock or impact the overall b61

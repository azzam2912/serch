it is an additive construct of several potentially overlapping frames the motivation for this concept comes from the event that a signal can not be acquired by a single sensor alone a constraint found by limitations of hardware or data throughput rather the partial components of the signal must be collected via a network of sensors and the partial signal representations are then fused into the complete signal by construction fusion frames easily lend themselves to parallel or distributed processing of sensor networks consisting of arbitrary overlapping sensor fields given a hilbert space formula 1 let formula 2 be closed subspaces of formula 1 where formula 4 is an index set let formula 5 be a set of positive scalar weights then formula 6 is a fusion frame of formula 1 if there exist constants formula 8 such that for all formula 9 we have formula 10 where formula 11 denotes the orthogonal projection onto the subspace formula 12 the constants formula 13 and formula 14 are called lower and upper bound respectively when the lower and upper bounds are equal to each other formula 6 becomes a formula 13 tight fusion frame furthermore if formula 17 we can call

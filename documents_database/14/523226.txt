it is therefore an algebraic subvariety of a of dimension dim a 1 classical results of bernhard riemann describe in another way in the case that a is the jacobian variety j of an algebraic curve compact riemann surface c there is for a choice of base point p on c a standard mapping of c to j by means of the interpretation of j as the linear equivalence classes of divisors on c of degree 0 that is q on c maps to the class of q p then since j is an algebraic group c may be added to itself k times on j giving rise to subvarieties w if g is the genus of c riemann proved that is a translate on j of w he also described which points on w are non singular they correspond to the effective divisors d of degree g 1 with no associated meromorphic functions other than constants in more classical language these d do not move in a linear system of divisors on c in the sense that they do not dominate the polar divisor of a non constant function riemann further proved the riemann singularity theorem identifying the multiplicity

the jwst will provide greatly improved resolution and sensitivity over the hubble and will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology including observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe such as the formation of the first galaxies other goals include understanding the formation of stars and planets and direct imaging of exoplanets and novas the primary mirror of the jwst the optical telescope element is composed of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold plated beryllium which combine to create a diameter mirror that is much larger than the hubble s mirror unlike the hubble which observes in the near ultraviolet visible and near infrared 0 1 to 1 m spectra the jwst will observe in a lower frequency range from long wavelength visible light through mid infrared 0 6 to 27 m which will allow it to observe high redshift objects that are too old and too distant for the hubble to observe the telescope must be kept very cold in order to observe in the infrared without interference so it will be deployed in space near the earth sun lagrangian point and a large sunshield made of

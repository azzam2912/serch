flows the formulation of a theory is invariant under it is generally agreed that flows indicate nothing more than a redundancy in the description of the dynamics of a system but often it is simpler computationally to work with a redundant description classically the action is a functional on the configuration space the on shell solutions are given by the variational problem of extremizing the action subject to boundary conditions while the boundary is often ignored in textbooks it is crucial in the study of flows suppose we have a flow i e the generator of a smooth one dimensional group of transformations of the configuration space which maps on shell states to on shell states while preserving the boundary conditions because of the variational principle the action for all of the configurations on the orbit is the same this is not the case for more general transformations which map on shell to on shell states but change the boundary conditions here are several examples in a theory with translational symmetry timelike translations are not flows because in general they change the boundary conditions however now take the case of a simple harmonic oscillator where the boundary points are at

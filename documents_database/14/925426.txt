this enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction mutations in rhodopsin kinase are associated with a form of night blindness called oguchi disease rhodopsin kinase is a member of the family of g protein coupled receptor kinases and is officially named g protein coupled receptor kinase 1 or grk1 rhodopsin kinase is found primarily in mammalian retinal rod cells where it phosphorylates light activated rhodopsin a member of the family of g protein coupled receptors that recognizes light phosphorylated light activated rhodopsin binds to the protein arrestin to terminate the light activated signaling cascade the related grk7 also known as cone opsin kinase serves a similar function in retinal cone cells subserving high acuity color vision in the fovea the post translational modification of grk1 by farnesylation and carboxyl methylation is important for regulating the ability of the enzyme to recognize rhodopsin in rod outer segment disk membranes arrestin 1 bound to rhodopsin prevents rhodopsin activation of the transducin protein to turn off photo transduction completely rhodopsin kinase is inhibited by the calcium binding protein recoverin in a graded manner that maintains rhodopsin sensitivity to light despite large changes in ambient light conditions that is in retinas exposed to only dim

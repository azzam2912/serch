the frequencies used by video signals are so high that the tape head speed is on the order of several meters per second tens of feet per second an order of magnitude faster than professional analog audio tape recording the bbc solved the problem by using reels of magnetic tape that passed static heads at a speed of vera was capable of recording about 15 minutes e g 4 572 meters of 405 line black and white video per reel and the picture tended to wobble because the synchronizing pulses that keep the picture stable were not recorded accurately enough in order to cope with 625 line pal or secam colour transmissions vera would likely have required an even faster and possibly unfeasible tape speed development began in 1952 but vera was not perfected until 1958 it was given a live demonstration on air in panorama on april 14 1958 richard dimbleby seated by a clock talked for a couple of minutes about the new method of vision recording with an instant playback and then the tape was wound back and replayed the picture was slightly watery but reasonably watchable and instant playback was something completely new however by this

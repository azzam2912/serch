it is named after its inventor edmond halley the algorithm is second in the class of householder s methods after newton s method like the latter it produces iteratively a sequence of approximations to the root their rate of convergence to the root is cubic multidimensional versions of this method exist halley s method exactly finds the roots of a linear over linear pad approximation to the function in contrast to newton s method or the secant method which approximate the function linearly or muller s method which approximates the function quadratically edmond halley was an english mathematician who introduced the method now called by his name halley s method is a numerical algorithm for solving the nonlinear equation f x 0 in this case the function f has to be a function of one real variable the method consists of a sequence of iterations beginning with an initial guess x if f is a three times continuously differentiable function and a is a zero of f but not of its derivative then in a neighborhood of a the iterates x satisfy this means that the iterates converge to the zero if the initial guess is sufficiently close and that

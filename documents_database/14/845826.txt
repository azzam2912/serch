oih is characterized as generalized pain that is not necessarily confined to the affected site over time individuals taking opioids can develop an increasing sensitivity to noxious stimuli even evolving a painful response to previously non noxious stimuli allodynia some studies on animals have also demonstrated this effect occurring after only a single high dose of opioids tolerance another condition that can arise from prolonged exposure to opioids can often be mistaken for opioid induced hyperalgesia and vice versa as the clinical presentation can appear similar although tolerance and opioid induced hyperalgesia both result in a similar need for dose escalation to receive the same level of effect to treat pain they are nevertheless caused by two distinct mechanisms the similar net effect makes the two phenomena difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting under chronic opioid treatment a particular individual s requirement for dose escalation may be due to tolerance opioid induced hyperalgesia or a combination of both in tolerance there is a lower sensitivity to opioids which occurs via two major theories decreased receptor activation desensitization of antinociceptive mechanisms and opioid receptor down regulation internalization of membrane receptors in opioid induced hyperalgesia sensitization of pronociceptive mechanisms occurs resulting

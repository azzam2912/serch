a genome is an organism s complete set of dna including all of its genes in contrast to genetics which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of all of an organism s genes their interrelations and influence on the organism genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules in turn proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput dna sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery based research and systems biology to facilitate understanding of even the most complex biological systems such as the brain the field also includes studies of intragenomic within the genome phenomena such as epistasis effect of one gene on another pleiotropy one gene affecting more than one trait heterosis hybrid vigour and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome from the greek gen gene gamma epsilon nu epsilon meaning

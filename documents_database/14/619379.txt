its most common cause is cold rainy or otherwise bad weather during the flowering stage of the vines though other factors such as boron deficiency or fanleaf degeneration may also play a role while millerandage will always cause a drop in yield its potential impact on wine quality will vary particularly by grape variety for some varieties that are prone to uneven ripeness within a cluster such as sangiovese zinfandel and gew rztraminer the development of millerandage may be unfavorable due to green flavors from the potentially unripe grapes hidden within the cluster for other varieties such as pinot noir or the mendoza clone of chardonnay wine quality could be improved due to the reduced overall berry size and higher skin to juice ratio the root cause of millerandage is the poor fertilization of grape flowers during the growing season while this is most often attributed to bad weather other factors such as nutritional deficiencies particularly of the mineral boron which is needed to synthesis the growth hormone auxin and facilitate the movement of sugars in the vine or viral infections can play a role for grapevines flowering occurs usually 8 weeks after the beginning of bud break when the

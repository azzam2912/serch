analogous to a facade in architecture a facade is an object that serves as a front facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code a facade can developers often use the facade design pattern when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has many interdependent classes or because its source code is unavailable this pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client it typically involves a single wrapper class that contains a set of members required by the client these members access the system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details the facade design pattern is one of the twenty three well known gof design patterns that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object oriented software that is objects that are easier to implement change test and reuse what problems can the facade design pattern solve clients that access a complex subsystem directly refer to depend on many different objects having different interfaces tight coupling which makes the clients hard to implement change test and reuse what solution does the facade design pattern describe define a

it is a severe variant of twin to twin transfusion syndrome ttts the twins blood systems are connected instead of independent one twin called the acardiac twin or trap fetus is severely malformed the heart is missing or deformed hence the name acardiac as are the upper structures of the body the legs may be partially present or missing and internal structures of the torso are often poorly formed the other twin is usually normal in appearance the normal twin called the pump twin drives blood through both fetuses it is called reversed arterial perfusion because in the acardiac twin the blood flows in a reversed direction trap sequence occurs in 1 of monochorionic twin pregnancies and in 1 in 35 000 pregnancies overall the acardiac twin is a parasitic twin that fails to properly develop a heart and therefore generally does not develop the upper structures of the body the parasitic twin little more than a torso with or without legs receives its blood supply from the host twin by means of an umbilical cord like structure which often only has 2 blood vessels instead of 3 much like a fetus in fetu except the acardiac twin is outside

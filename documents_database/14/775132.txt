for nearly 30 years it was the last true analog synthesizer made by roland and has been critically acclaimed as one of their classic analog instruments in 2015 roland once again started producing analog synthesizers beginning with their jd xa and jd xi keyboards as analog digital crossover synthesizers the design on the jx 10 is essentially two roland jx 8p synthesizers put together with a 76 note velocity sensitive keyboard with aftertouch it also includes features not found on the jx 8p including a simple 1 track sketchbook sequencer and a delay effect which works like a midi delay by delaying one tone rather than acting as a true dsp delay effect however the jx 10 is not exactly the same as two jx 8p s because the chorus is not identical to the jx 8p hence the chorus sounds different between the jx 8p and the jx 10 with single patches the jx 10 also has a slightly different amplifier section as well as different electronic components which further distinguish its sound from its predecessor the jx 8p like most synthesizers of the time the jx 10 is programmed by selecting the desired parameter through a keypad and

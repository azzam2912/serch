routers will select the desired path on the basis of number of hops distance lowest cost latency measurements or based on the least congested route anycast networks are widely used for content delivery network cdn products to bring their content closer to the end user the internet protocol and other network addressing systems recognize five main addressing methods anycast can be implemented by using border gateway protocol bgp multiple hosts usually in different geographic areas are given the same unicast ip address and different routes to the address are announced through bgp routers consider these to be alternative routes to the same destination though they are actually routes to different destinations with the same address as usual routers select a route by whatever distance metric is in use the least cost least congested shortest selecting a route in this setup amounts to selecting a destination the pitfall of this approach is that a connection to an anycast address may fail because the network can change the routing of packets in mid connection due to congestion or changes in the network with the result that the destination changes mid connection though the new destination is not aware of the connection and

the helmet was made through the use of slivers of boar tusks which were attached to a leather base padded with felt in rows a description of a boar s tusk helmet appears in book ten of homer s iliad as odysseus is armed for a night raid to be conducted against the trojans fragments of ivory which might have come from helmets of this kind have been discovered on mycenaean sites at dendra for instance fragments were found alongside the bronze panoply excavated in 1960 and an ivory plaque also from a mycenaean site represents a helmet of this kind although they would not provide as good protection as a metal helmet they may have been worn by some leaders as a status symbol or a means of identification homer specifies that the helmet given by meriones to odysseus was an heirloom passed down through the generations a detail which perhaps suggests its value although the number of plates required to make an entire helmet varies anything from 40 to 140 can be required it has been estimated that forty to fifty boars would have to be killed to make just one helmet

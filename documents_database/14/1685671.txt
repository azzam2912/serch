it is found in the c terminal part of a number of plant cell wall proteins which are defined not only by the burp domain but also by the overall similarity in their modular construction the burp domain proteins consists of either three or four modules i an n terminal hydrophobic domain a presumptive transit peptide joined to ii a short conserved segment or other short segment iii an optional segment consisting of repeated units which is unique to each member and iv the c terminal burp domain although the burp domain proteins share primary structural features their expression patterns and the conditions under which they are expressed differ the presence of the conserved burp domain in diverse plant proteins suggests an important role for this domain it is possible that the burp domain represents a general motif for localization of proteins within the cell wall matrix the other structural domains associated with the burp domain may specify other target sites for intermolecular interactions some proteins known to contain a burp domain are listed below

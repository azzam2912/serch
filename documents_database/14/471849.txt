he carried out studies on phenols and discovered a phenol derivative now known as bisphenol a and the accordingly named dianin s compound he was married to the adopted daughter of fellow chemist alexander borodin in 1887 dianin succeeded his father in law as chair of the chemistry department at the imperial medical surgical academy in st petersburg now the s m kirov military medical academy dianin s method for preparing bisphenol a from 1891 remains the most widely known approach to this important compound though the method has been refined for industrial scale synthesis it involves the catalysed condensation of a 2 1 mixture of phenol and acetone in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid the reaction proceeds readily at room temperature producing a crude product containing a great variety of side products including dianin s compound in a matter of hours the overall equation is simple with water as the only by product mechanistically the acid catalyst converts the acetone to a carbenium ion that undergoes an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction with the phenol producing predominantly para substituted products a second carbenium species is produced by protonation and loss of the aliphatic hydroxyl group leading

the gtk server project aims to bring graphical user interface programming to any interpreted language using the gimp tool kit gtk or xforms the gtk server provides a stream oriented interface to gtk if the gtk server is compiled as a standalone binary it allows five different interfaces stdin fifo named pipe ipc message queue tcp or udp any interpreted language or shellscript with i o capabilities can start the gtk server with an argument specifying the type of interface and can start sending gtk function calls in s expression format after each request the gtk server returns a result depending on the type of gtk function invoked if the gtk server is compiled as a shared object it exports the function gtk which must be imported in the client program first after that the client program can start sending gtk function calls in s expression format as argument to the imported gtk function before the gtk server actually can execute gtk functions it has to read a configuration file in which the prototypes of the gtk functions are described since version 2 2 3 this also can be done on the fly allowing the gtk server to run without

recently two mks genes mks1 and mks3 have been identified a study done recently has described the cellular sub cellular and functional characterization of the novel proteins mks1 and meckelin encoded by these genes the malfunction of this protein production is mainly responsible for this lethal disorder recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of genetic disorders both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related may be in fact highly related in the genetypical root cause of the widely varying phenotypically observed disorders thus meckel gruber syndrome is a ciliopathy other known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia bardet biedl syndrome polycystic kidney and liver disease nephronophthisis alstr m syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration the mks1 gene has been identified as being associated with a ciliopathy dysplastic kidneys are prevalent in over 95 of all identified cases when this occurs microscopic cysts develop within the kidney and slowly destroy it causing it to enlarge to 10 to 20 times its original size the level of amniotic fluid within the womb may be significantly altered or remain normal and a normal level of fluid should not be

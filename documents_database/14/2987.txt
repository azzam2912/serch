a computational problem is a task solved by a computer a computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps such as an algorithm a problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources whatever the algorithm used the theory formalizes this intuition by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity i e the amount of resources needed to solve them such as time and storage other measures of complexity are also used such as the amount of communication used in communication complexity the number of gates in a circuit used in circuit complexity and the number of processors used in parallel computing one of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do the p versus np problem one of the seven millennium prize problems is dedicated to the field of computational complexity closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory a key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a

the concept study was done to support the nasa 2010 planetary science decadal survey due to the orbits and relative positions of saturn and earth launch was proposed for 30 august 2027 for a 22 june 2034 arrival the mission was studied for the nasa planetary science decadal survey as a possible nasa new frontiers class mission to unveil the processes of outer planet formation and solar system evolution detailed studies of the composition structure and dynamics of giant planet interiors and atmospheres would be necessary to constrain the internal structure of gas giants a combination of both in situ entry probe missions and remote sensing studies of the giant planets would be needed the saturn atmospheric entry probe mission would consist of a carrier relay spacecraft and a probe the carrier relay spacecraft would release the probe into saturn a gas giant and provide data relay from the probe to earth the probe would determine the structure of the atmosphere as well as noble gas abundances and isotopic ratios of hydrogen carbon nitrogen and oxygen tier 2 objectives include in order to complete its objectives the probe must carry at least these two instruments launch is proposed for 30

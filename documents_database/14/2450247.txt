it was introduced by frigyes riesz in 1912 let formula 1 be a closed linear operator in the banach space formula 2 let formula 3 be a simple or composite rectifiable contour which encloses some region formula 4 and lies entirely within the resolvent set formula 5 formula 6 of the operator formula 1 assuming that the contour formula 3 has a positive orientation with respect to the region formula 4 the riesz projector corresponding to formula 3 is defined by here formula 12 is the identity operator in formula 2 if formula 14 is the only point of the spectrum of formula 1 in formula 4 then formula 17 is denoted by formula 18 the operator formula 17 is a projector which commutes with formula 1 and hence in the decomposition both terms formula 22 and formula 23 are invariant subspaces of the operator formula 1 moreover if formula 31 and formula 32 are two different contours having the properties indicated above and the regions formula 33 and formula 34 have no points in common then the projectors corresponding to them are mutually orthogonal

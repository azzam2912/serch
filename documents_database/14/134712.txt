there are several nonequivalent definitions of group algebra each of which is considered convenient in a particular situation if formula 1 is a finite group then for any field formula 2 the set formula 3 of all functions formula 4 possesses a natural structure of finite dimensional hopf algebra over formula 2 with the usual pointwise summation of functions and multiplication them by scalars and the dual space formula 14 of all linear functionals formula 15 is the dual hopf algebra where in particular the multiplication formula 16 can be described by the formula formula 17 or by the formula formula 18 where formula 19 are delta functionals and formula 20 are the expansions of formula 21 and formula 22 along the basis formula 23 in the vector space formula 24 example the operation of passage to the delta functional formula 36 is a representation of formula 1 in formula 24 formula 39 there is a natural correspondence between the representations of the group formula 1 in unital associative algebras formula 31 and the homomorphisms of the unital algebras formula 42 this observation has a series of important corollaries which allow to reduce the theory of representations of finite groups

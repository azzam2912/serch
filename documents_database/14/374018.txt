they are used in lasers for q switching telecommunications for signal modulation and in spectroscopy for frequency control a piezoelectric transducer is attached to a material such as glass an oscillating electric signal drives the transducer to vibrate which creates sound waves in the material these can be thought of as moving periodic planes of expansion and compression that change the index of refraction incoming light scatters see brillouin scattering off the resulting periodic index modulation and interference occurs similar to bragg diffraction the interaction can be thought of as a three wave mixing process resulting in sum frequency generation or difference frequency generation between phonons and photons the properties of the light exiting the aom can be controlled in five ways this frequency shift is also required by the fact that energy and momentum of the photons and phonons are conserved in the process a typical frequency shift varies from 27 mhz for a less expensive aom to 1 ghz for a state of the art commercial device in some aoms two acoustic waves travel in opposite directions in the material creating a standing wave in this case the spectrum of the diffracted beam contains multiple frequency shifts in

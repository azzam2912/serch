the satellite was planned for launch together with cheops characterising exoplanets satellite in 2019 however this launch is no longer as of 2019 considered some sources name 2020 or 2021 as the launch year of the satellite nano jasmine is a microsatellite measuring and weighing approximately it carries a small ritchey chr tien telescope that will make observations in the infrared spectrum allowing for easier observation toward the center of the milky way its exterior is covered with gaas solar cells providing approximately 20 watts of power due to limited bandwidth nano jasmine will employ a star image extractor sie for onboard raw image processing that will extract and transmit only specific object data nano jasmine is japan s first and the world s third astrometric survey spacecraft following hipparcos 1989 and gaia 2013 both launched by the european space agency it is the pathfinder in a planned series of three spacecraft of increasing size and capability the second is small jasmine with a telescope and the third being jasmine with an telescope the spacecraft is designed to have an astrometric accuracy 2 3 mas for stars less than 7 5 magnitude comparable to hipparcos 1 mas nano jasmine should

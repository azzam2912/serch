it is traversed by a large area of a very pale fawn made more accentuated by the colour of the yellow red decurrent cords on two thirds of the whorls in their midst the shell contains seven whorls the two white opaque whorls in the protoconch are rounded and smooth the intermediates whorls are rather convex angular on the first whorls in the upper part becoming rounder on the penultimate whorl and rather convex on the body whorl the whorls are crossed by longitudinal ribs these are oblique flexuous shallow rounded thin their intersections are wider on the upper whorls closer on the penultimate and the body whorl the many high spiral lirae are a little more slender than the ribs when crossing the ribs the produce a very fine granulation forming an elegant reticulation whose mesh is wider than higher and their interstices crisscross by very subtle growth streaks the body whorl occupies more than half the total length of the shell it is elongated more convex slightly rounded at the top becoming angular towards the middle of the columellar side it is strongly depressed below this angulation which is accentuated on the dorsal part and ends in an

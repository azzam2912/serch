there are a number of different transposition mechanisms in nature but tn 10 uses the non replicative cut and paste mechanism the transposase protein recognizes the ends of the element and cuts it from the original locus the protein dna complex then diffuses away from the donor site until random collisions brings it in contact with a new target site where it is integrated to accomplish this reaction the 50 kda transposase protein must break four dna strands to free the transposon from the donor site and perform two strand exchange reactions to integrate the element at the target site this leaves two strands unjoined at the target site but the host dna repair proteins take care of this the target site selection is essentially random but there is a preference for the sequence 5 gctnagc 3 the 6 9 base pairs that flank the sequence also influence selection of the insertion site cut and paste transposition does not cause an increase in the number of transposons per se there is one copy at the start and one copy at the end if this was the end of the matter the transposon would perish by genetic drift and the loss

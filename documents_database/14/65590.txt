its function is to transmit sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear and then to the oval window in the fluid filled cochlea hence it ultimately converts and amplifies vibration in air to vibration in fluid the malleus bone bridges the gap between the eardrum and the other ossicles rupture or perforation of the eardrum can lead to conductive hearing loss collapse or retraction of the eardrum can cause conductive hearing loss or cholesteatoma the tympanic membrane is oriented obliquely in the anteroposterior mediolateral and superoinferior planes consequently its superoposterior end lies lateral to its anteroinferior end anatomically it relates superiorly to the middle cranial fossa posteriorly to the ossicles and facial nerve inferiorly to the parotid gland and anteriorly to the temporomandibular joint the eardrum is divided into two general regions the pars flaccida and the pars tensa the relatively fragile pars flaccida lies above the lateral process of the malleus between the notch of rivinus and the anterior and posterior malleal folds consisting of two layers and appearing slightly pinkish in hue it is associated with eustachian tube dysfunction and cholesteatomas the larger pars tensa consists of three layers skin fibrous tissue and mucosa

in contrast to robots built from rigid materials soft robots allow for increased flexibility and adaptability for accomplishing tasks as well as improved safety when working around humans these characteristics allow for its potential use in the fields of medicine and manufacturing the bulk of the field of soft robotics is based upon the design and construction of robots made completely from compliant materials with the end result being similar to invertebrates like worms and octopuses the motion of these robots is difficult to model as continuum mechanics apply to them and they are sometimes referred to as continuum robots soft robotics is the specific sub field of robotics dealing with constructing robots from highly compliant materials similar to those found in living organisms similarly soft robotics also draws heavily from the way in which these living organisms move and adapt to their surroundings this allows scientists to use soft robots to understand biological phenomena using experiments that cannot be easily performed on the original biological counterparts in contrast to robots built from rigid materials soft robots allow for increased flexibility and adaptability for accomplishing tasks as well as improved safety when working around humans these characteristics allow for its

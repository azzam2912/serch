a left handed polyproline ii helix ppii poly pro ii is formed when sequential residues all adopt backbone dihedral angles of roughly 75 150 and have trans isomers of their peptide bonds this ppii conformation is also common in proteins and polypeptides with other amino acids apart from proline similarly a more compact right handed polyproline i helix ppi poly pro i is formed when sequential residues all adopt backbone dihedral angles of roughly 75 160 and have cis isomers of their peptide bonds of the twenty common naturally occurring amino acids only proline is likely to adopt the cis isomer of the peptide bond specifically the x pro peptide bond steric and electronic factors heavily favor the trans isomer in most other peptide bonds however peptide bonds that replace proline with another n substituted amino acid such as sarcosine are also likely to adopt the cis isomer the ppii helix is defined by backbone dihedral angles of roughly 75 150 and trans isomers of the peptide bonds the rotation angle per residue of any polypeptide helix with trans isomers is given by the equation substitution of the poly pro ii dihedral angles into this equation yields almost exactly 120

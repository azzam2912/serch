the theorem also has been studied by diederik korteweg in 1883 and by lord rayleigh in 1913 this theorem is in fact true for any fluid motion where the nonlinear term of the incompressible navier stokes equations can be neglected or equivalently when formula 1 where formula 2 is the vorticity vector for example the theorem also applies to unidirectional flows such as couette flow and hagen poiseuille flow where nonlinear terms disappear automatically let formula 3 and formula 4 be the velocity pressure and strain rate tensor of the stokes flow and formula 5 and formula 6 be the velocity pressure and strain rate tensor of any other incompressible motion with formula 7 on the boundary let formula 8 and formula 9 be the representation of velocity and strain tensor in index notation where the index runs from one to three consider the following integral where in the above integral only symmetrical part of the deformation tensor remains because the contraction of symmetrical and antisymmetrical tensor is identically zero integration by parts gives the first integral is zero because velocity at the boundaries of the two fields are equal now for the second integral since formula 8 satisfies the

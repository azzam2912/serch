there is one fewer quantile than the number of groups created thus quartiles are the three cut points that will divide a dataset into four equal sized groups common quantiles have special names for instance quartile decile creating 10 groups see below for more the groups created are termed halves thirds quarters etc though sometimes the terms for the quantile are used for the groups created rather than for the cut points quantiles are values that partition a finite set of values into subsets of nearly equal sizes there are of the quantiles one for each integer satisfying in some cases the value of a quantile may not be uniquely determined as can be the case for the median 2 quantile of a uniform probability distribution on a set of even size quantiles can also be applied to continuous distributions providing a way to generalize rank statistics to continuous variables when the cumulative distribution function of a random variable is known the quantiles are the application of the quantile function the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function to the values some quantiles have special names as in the computation of for example standard deviation the estimation of a quantile

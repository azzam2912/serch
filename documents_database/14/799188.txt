singles from the album included rabba released in 2003 and sajan released in 2004 the tunes on sampooran were written incorporating traditional material from the eastern classical tradition and adapting these with music which was based on the jazz rock fusion explosion of the seventies it possesses arguably the finest musical arrangements that have ever been experienced in the country and the compositions really light up the album the album starts with the lukewarm sajan whose lyrics have been taken from a kaafi written by shah hussain a moderate mix of acoustic guitars and percussion and some sweet flute playing renders this a really good opening track waris shah is next with its yanni isque musical intonations and lyrics inspired from texts by amrita preetam the album seems to be getting into a groove as the vocals start getting tuned up and the music gets more and more passionate a classically inspired flute arrangement mixed with soft bass drums and javed bashir does total justice with the lyrics the song has probably lingered on a bit and some pieces seem a bit lengthy but overall it is the vocals that stand out on waris shah more than anything else rabba

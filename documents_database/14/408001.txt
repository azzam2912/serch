the cutting edges of the drill bit contact the workpiece and are connected via the shaft with the shank which fits into the chuck in many cases a general purpose arrangement is used such as a bit with cylindrical shaft and shank in a three jaw chuck which grips a cylindrical shank tightly different shank and chuck combination can deliver improved performance such as allowing higher torque greater centering accuracy or moving the bit but not the chuck with a hammer action this shank was common before 1850 and is still in production at first the tapered shank was just rammed into a square hole in the end of the drill over time various chuck designs have been invented and modern chucks can grasp and drive this shank effectively it has been difficult to find a reference to the included angle of the taper but 7 different bits were measured and they all had an included angle of 8 0 25 degrees the straight shank is the most usual style on modern drill bits by number manufactured the whole of the drill bit shaft and shank is usually of the same diameter it is held usually in a three jaw

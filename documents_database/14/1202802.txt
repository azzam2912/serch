this came as a surprise because when the cosmological constant is zero a vacuum solution of 2 1 dimensional gravity is necessarily flat the weyl tensor vanishes in three dimensions while the ricci tensor vanishes due to the einstein field equations so the full riemann tensor vanishes and it can be shown that no black hole solutions with event horizons exist but thanks to the negative cosmological constant in the btz black hole it is able to have remarkably similar properties to the 3 1 dimensional schwarzschild and kerr black hole solutions which model real world black holes the similarities to the ordinary black holes in 3 1 dimensions since 2 1 dimensional gravity has no newtonian limit one might fear that the btz black hole is not the final state of a gravitational collapse it was however shown that this black hole could arise from collapsing matter and we can calculate the energy moment tensor of btz as same as 3 1 black holes section 3 black holes and gravitational collapse the btz solution is often discussed in the realm on 2 1 dimensional quantum gravity the metric in the absence of charge is where formula 2 are the

the control net at a terminated row resembles the letter t modeling surfaces with t splines can reduce the number of control points in comparison to nurbs surfaces and make pieces easier to merge but increases the book keeping effort to keep track of the irregular connectivity t splines can be converted into nurbs surfaces by knot insertion and nurbs can be represented as t splines without t s or by removing knots t splines can therefore in theory do everything that nurbs can do in practice enormous amount of programming was required to make nurbs work as well as they do and creating the equivalent t spline functionality would require similar effort to smoothly join at points where more than three surface pieces meet t splines have been combined with geometrically continuous constructions of degree 3 by 3 bi cubic and more recently of degree 4 by 4 bi quartic t splines subdivision surfaces nurbs surfaces and polygon meshes are alternative technologies subdivision surfaces as well as t spline and nurbs surfaces with the addition of geometrically continuous constructions can represent everywhere smooth surfaces of any connectivity and topology such as holes branches and handles however none of t

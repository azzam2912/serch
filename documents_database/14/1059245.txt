the shells of species in the family vermetidae are extremely irregular and do not resemble the average snail shell hence the common name worm shells or worm snails these snails usually grow cemented onto a hard surface or cemented together in colonies these snails do not have typical regularly coiled gastropod shells instead they have very irregular elongated tubular shells which are moulded to and cemented to a surface of attachment such as a rock or another shell in the adult the apertural part of the shell is usually free with the opening directed upward some species have an operculum and some do not damaged sections of the shell can be sealed off by calcareous septa when necessary some vermetids are solitary whereas others live in colonies partially cemented together the shells of species within this family vary greatly and can sometimes be extremely challenging to identify the empty calcareous tubes of certain marine annelid tube worms for example the serpulidae can sometimes be casually misidentified as empty vermetid shells and vice versa the difference is that vermetid shells are shiny inside and have three shell layers whereas the annelid worm tubes are dull inside and have only two shell

the members of the genus are diurnal and terrestrial in behaviour exhibiting bright colouration or cryptic markings which are species specific mantella are an example of convergent evolution the independent evolution of a similar trait with species of a different lineage in this they are similar to the family dendrobatidae from latin america in size appearance and also some aspects of their behaviour however they are in no means related to the famous neotropical family during the early description of the first specimens from 1866 1872 alfred grandidier described both the brown mantella mantella betsileo and malagasy mantella mantella madagascariensis and placed them within the genus dendrobates based upon their close resemblance to them of course the placement of these new species was ambiguous and heavily debated until in 1882 george albert boulenger created the genus mantella after describing both cowan s mantella mantella cowanii and later in 1888 baron s mantella mantella baroni the species was named by boulenger after the gentleman that collected the specimens rev richard baron who was a missionary and botanist living in madagascar baron was also interested in geology and herpetology collecting many specimens upon his extensive expeditions across the country this species of

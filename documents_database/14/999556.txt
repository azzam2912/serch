there are two types of vehicle emission control systems the orvr and the stage ii vapor recovery system without either of these two systems fuel vapors trapped inside gas tanks would be released into the atmosphere each time refueling of the vehicle occurred however an orvr system is able to retain those emissions delivering them to the vehicle s carbon filled canister and then to dispose of those vapors by adding them to the engine intake manifold and the stream of fuel supplying the engine during normal operation the goal behind implementing the orvr system throughout the u s is to eventually make the stage ii systems obsolete william f woodcock william e ruhig jr and loren h kline hold the patents for the orvr system according to freda fung and bob maxwell the environmental protection agency epa has been controlling emissions among the united states since the 1970s they implemented regulations which would limit the amount of fuel vapor released into the atmosphere during the refueling of a motor vehicle before any epa mandate was put into action california devised its own regulations ahead of every other state by 16 years when it required the implementation of the stage

it is an ill posed problem as the motion is in three dimensions but the images are a projection of the 3d scene onto a 2d plane the motion vectors may relate to the whole image global motion estimation or specific parts such as rectangular blocks arbitrary shaped patches or even per pixel the motion vectors may be represented by a translational model or many other models that can approximate the motion of a real video camera such as rotation and translation in all three dimensions and zoom more often than not the term motion estimation and the term optical flow are used interchangeably it is also related in concept to image registration and stereo correspondence in fact all of these terms refer to the process of finding corresponding points between two images or video frames the points that correspond to each other in two views images or frames of a real scene or object are usually the same point in that scene or on that object before we do motion estimation we must define our measurement of correspondence i e the matching metric which is a measurement of how similar two image points are there is no right or

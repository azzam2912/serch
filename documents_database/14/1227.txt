the most common bead weaving technique requires two passes of the weft thread first an entire row of beads is strung on the weft thread then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads the needle is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place heddle looms were popular near the beginning of the 20th century they allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed the space between the lowered and raised threads there are still a few heddle bead looms being manufactured today the most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads although loomed pieces are typically rectangular it is possible to increase and decrease to produce angular or curvy shapes fringe can also be added during weaving or before the piece is removed from the loom bead looms vary in size and are typically made of wood or metal usually a comb or spring is used to hold the warp threads a bead width apart some looms have roller bars that allow the weaver to produce pieces that are longer than the loom most looms are meant to sit

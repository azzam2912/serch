while the dispute has historically centered on the exact make up of the insect head it has been widened to include other living arthropods such as the crustaceans and chelicerates and fossil forms such as the many arthropods known from exceptionally preserved cambrian faunas while the topic has classically been based on insect embryology in recent years a great deal of developmental molecular data has become available dozens of more or less distinct solutions to the problem dating back to at least 1897 have been published including several in the 2000s the arthropod head problem is popularly known as the endless dispute the title of a famous paper on the subject by jacob g rempel in 1975 referring to its seemingly intractable nature although some progress has been made since that time the precise nature of especially the labrum and the pre oral region of arthropods remain highly controversial recent research suggests that some key events in the evolution of the arthropod body resulted from changes in certain hox genes dna sequences the trunks of arthropods comprise repeated segments which are typically associated with various structures such as a pair of appendages apodemes for muscle attachment ganglia and at least

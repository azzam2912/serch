in this sense a core is the scarred nucleus resulting from the detachment of one or more flakes from a lump of source material or tool stone usually by using a hard hammer percussor such as a hammerstone the core is marked with the negative scars of these flakes the surface area of the core which received the blows necessary for detaching the flakes is referred to as the striking platform the core may be discarded or shaped further into a core tool such as can be seen in some types of handaxe the purpose of lithic reduction may be to rough out a blank for later refinement into a projectile point knife or other stone tool or it may be performed in order to obtain sharp flakes from which a variety of simple tools can be made generally the presence of a core is indicative of the latter process since the former process usually leaves no core because the morphology of cores will influence the shape of flakes by studying the core surface morphology we might be able to know more information about the dimensional flake attribute including their length and thickness cores may be subdivided into specific types

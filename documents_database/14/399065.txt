as these interstitial atoms distort the lattice slightly there will be an associated residual stress field surrounding the interstitial this stress field can be relaxed by the interstitial atom diffusing towards a dislocation which contains a small gap at its core as it is a more open structure see figure 1 once the atom has diffused into the dislocation core the atom will stay typically only one interstitial atom is required per lattice plane of the dislocation once a dislocation has become pinned a large force is required to unpin the dislocation prior the yielding thus at room temperature the dislocation will not get unpinned this produces an observed upper yield point in a stress strain graph beyond the upper yield point the pinned dislocation will act as frank read source to generate new dislocations that are not pinned these dislocations are free to move in the crystal which results in a subsequent lower yield point and the material will deform in a more plastic manner leaving the sample to age by holding it at room temperature for a few hours enables the carbon atoms to rediffuse back to dislocation cores resulting in a return of the upper yield point

during aging of alcohols in oak barrels vescalagin can be extracted from the wood and can subsequently be transformed into new derivatives by chemical reactions vescalagin is one of the most abundant ellagitannins extracted from oak wood using white wine the flavono ellagitannin known as acutissimin a is created when the oak tannin vescalagin interacts with a flavonoid in wine in some plants including oak and chestnut the ellagitannins are formed from 1 2 3 4 6 pentagalloyl glucose and further elaborated via oxidative dehydrogenation tellimagrandin ii and casuarictin formations after conversion of casuarictin to pedunculagin the pyranose ring of the glucose opens and the family of compounds including casuariin casuarinin castalagin and castlin vescalagin and vescalin forms castalagin thus forms from a pentagalloyl glucose structure castalagin and vescalagin 1 2 3 5 nonahydroxytriphenoyl 4 6 hexahydroxydiphenoyl glucoses can be further polymerized in their corresponding dimers roburin a and roburin d and 33 carboxy 33 deoxyvescalagin grandinin is a castalagin glycoside by binding of the pentose lyxose

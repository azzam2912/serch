the whorls are marked by a narrow obscurely nodulous spiral keel at the summit which is followed by a depressed spiral sulcus that equals the keel in width the two comprise the posterior two fifths of the whorls between the sutures the anterior three fifths are marked by strong broad low rounded slightly protractive axial ribs which are strongest at their junction with the sulcus beyond which they scarcely extend the type has lost the early whorls upon the first of those remaining there are 10 and upon the rest 12 ribs intercostal spaces are about one half as wide as the ribs on account of the closely appressed summits the sutures are poorly defined the base of the body whorl is moderately long marked by the continuations of the ribs which gradually weaken in strength as they pass forward the entire surface of the spire and base are marked by lines of growth and numerous closely crowded fine wavy spiral striations the posterior angle of the aperture is acute sinus below the keel at the summit the sigmoid columella is covered by a thin callus which also extends over the parietal wall in the posterior portion of which it

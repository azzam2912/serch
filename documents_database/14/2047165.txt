research in the uk suggests that actual carbon emissions from new homes can be 2 5 times the design estimates on average for non domestic buildings the gap is even higher actual carbon emissions as much as 3 8 times the design estimates on average there are established tools for reducing the performance gap by reviewing project objectives outline and detailed design drawings design calculations implementation of designs on site and post occupancy evaluation nef s assured performance process app is one such tool which is being used extensively on different sites that form part of east hampshire s whitehill and bordon new town development one of the largest regeneration projects anywhere in the uk with high ambitions for both environmental performance and health the performance gap is produced mainly due to uncertainties uncertainties are found in any real world system and buildings are no exception as early as 1978 gero and dudnik wrote a paper presenting a methodology to solve the problem of designing subsystems hvac subjected to uncertain demands after that other authors have shown an interest in the uncertainties that are present in building design ramallo gonz lez classified uncertainties in building design construction in three different

his book the knot book has been praised for its accessible approach to advanced topics in knot theory he is currently francis christopher oakley third century professor of mathematics at williams college where he has been since 1985 he writes mathematically bent a column of math humor for the mathematical intelligencer adams received a b sc from mit in 1978 and a ph d in mathematics from the university of wisconsin madison in 1983 his dissertation was entitled hyperbolic structures on link complements and supervised by james cannon in 2012 he became a fellow of the american mathematical society among his earliest contributions is his theorem that the gieseking manifold is the unique cusped hyperbolic 3 manifold of smallest volume the proof utilizes horoball packing arguments adams is known for his clever use of such arguments utilizing horoball patterns and his work would be used in the later proof by cao and meyerhoff that the smallest cusped orientable hyperbolic 3 manifolds are precisely the figure eight knot complement and its sibling manifold adams has investigated and defined a variety of geometric invariants of hyperbolic links and hyperbolic 3 manifolds in general he developed techniques for working with volumes of special

it is also identified as wucam and vstm3 tigit could bind to cd155 pvr on dendritic cells dcs macrophages etc with high affinity and also to cd112 pvrl2 with lower affinity research has shown that tigit fc fusion protein could interact with pvr on dendritic cells and increase its il 10 secretion level decrease its il 12 secretion level under lps stimulation and also inhibit t cell activation in vivo tigit s inhibition of nk cytotoxicity can be blocked by antibodies against its interaction with pvr and the activity is directed through its itim domain tigit regulates t cell mediated immunity via the cd226 tigit pvr pathway during human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection tigit expressing cd8 t cells has been shown to be expanded and associated with clinical markers of hiv disease progression in a diverse group of hiv infected individuals elevated tigit levels remained sustained even among those with undetectable viral loads and a large fraction of hiv specific cd8 t cells simultaneously express both tigit and another negative checkpoint receptor programmed death protein 1 pd 1 and retained several features of exhausted t cells blocking these pathways with novel targeted monoclonal antibodies synergistically rejuvenated hiv specific cd8 t

it is a particular issue in 4wd cars with tires having varied tread patterns or brands despite marked size different brands often differ in actual size even if both front and rear are the same brand and marked with the same size they may still differ in actual size a pull to the right or left when driving or braking could trigger windup caused by mismatched tire tread sizes heavy off road vehicles using 6 6 or 8 8 may use a h drive drivetrain these are particularly prone to driveline windup h drives do not use axles but rather individual wheel stations carried on a punt or backbone chassis a single differential splits the drive into separate left and right drive shafts which each run fore and aft inside the bottom corners of the chassis at each wheel station a bevel box drives the half shaft out to the wheel unlike a typical transfer box for permanent four wheel drive there is no differential action front to back when used for equally spaced wheels i e rather than cargo trucks with close set rear axles the front two wheels are arranged so that both steer the rear less so

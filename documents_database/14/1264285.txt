compared to the unified system and video memory used by other 8 bit computers of the time such as the apple ii zx spectrum and commodore 64 separate memory has the advantage of freeing up of the z80 processor s 64 kib address space for main ram and the vdp doesn t need to steal cpu cycles to access video memory the disadvantage is that the program has to use the cpu s dedicated i o instructions to command the vdp to manipulate the contents of the video ram this not only slows down video access but also makes the porting of games from unified memory platforms more difficult attempts of porting zx spectrum games in the uk the system most similar to the msx were often thwarted by this difference also programmers had to learn to optimally use the more advanced capabilities of the vdp the tms9918a s method of accessing the video ram is slower than direct access as used in unified memory computers because accessing video memory involved first outputting the low then the hi byte of the 14 bit video memory address to i o port 99 then one or more bytes of 8 bit data

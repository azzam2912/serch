this includes traditional industrial robots as well as emerging technologies such as drone aircraft and wearable robotic exoskeletons types of accidents include collisions crushing and injuries from mechanical parts hazard controls include physical barriers good work practices and proper maintenance many workplace robots are industrial robots used in manufacturing according to the international federation of robotics 1 7 million new robots are expected to be used in factories between 2017 and 2020 emerging robot technologies include collaborative robots personal care robots construction robots exoskeletons autonomous vehicles such as google s self driving car project and drone aircraft also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or uavs advances in automation technologies e g fixed robots collaborative and mobile robots and exoskeletons have the potential to improve work conditions but also to introduce workplace hazards in manufacturing workplaces 1 fifty six percent of robot injuries are classified as pinch injuries and 44 of injuries are classified as impact injuries a 1987 study found that line workers are at the greatest risk followed by maintenance workers and programmers poor workplace design and human error caused most injuries despite the lack of occupational surveillance data on injuries associated specifically with robots researchers from the us

the problem is as follows if the viewer stands too close to the wall or too far from the wall the angle is small somewhere in between it is as large as possible the same approach applies to finding the optimal place from which to kick a ball in rugby for that matter it is not necessary that the alignment of the picture be at right angles we might be looking at a window of the leaning tower of pisa or a realtor showing off the advantages of a sky light in a sloping attic roof there is a unique circle passing through the top and bottom of the painting and tangent to the eye level line by elementary geometry if the viewer s position were to move along the circle the angle subtended by the painting would remain constant all positions on the eye level line except the point of tangency are outside of the circle and therefore the angle subtended by the painting from those points is smaller by euclid s elements iii 36 alternatively the power of a point theorem the distance from the wall to the point of tangency is the geometric mean of the heights

like all synthetic elements it has no stable isotopes the first isotope to be synthesized was lr in 1961 there are twelve known radioisotopes from lr to lr and 1 isomer lr the longest lived isotope is lr with a half life of 11 hours heavier isotopes are expected to have longer half lives this reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by yuri oganessian and his team at the flnr evidence was provided for the formation of lr in the 2n exit channel this reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by yuri oganessian and his team at the flnr this reaction was reported in 1984 by yuri oganessian at the flnr the team was able to detect decays of cf a descendant of lr this reaction was studied in a series of experiments in 1976 by yuri oganessian and his team at the flnr results are not readily available this reaction has been used to study the spectroscopic properties of lr the team at ganil used the reaction in 2003 and the team at the flnr used it between 2004 2006 to provide further information for the decay scheme of lr the

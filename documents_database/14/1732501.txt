depending on the flow configurations the kinematic wave can be linear or non linear which depends on whether the wave celerity is a constant or a variable kinematic wave can be described by a simple partial differential equation with a single unknown field variable e g the flow or wave height formula 1 in terms of the two independent variables namely the time formula 2 and the space formula 3 with some parameters coefficients containing information about the physics and geometry of the flow in general the wave can be advecting and diffusing however in simple situation the kinematic wave is mainly advecting non linear kinematic wave for debris flow can be written as follows with complex non linear coefficients where formula 1 is the debris flow height formula 2 is the time formula 3 is the downstream channel position formula 8 is the pressure gradient and the depth dependent nonlinear variable wave speed and formula 9 is a flow height and pressure gradient dependent variable diffusion term this equation can also be written in the conservative form where formula 11 is the generalized flux that depends on several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow flow height and the

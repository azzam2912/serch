the bacterial haemoglobin vhb was first discovered from vitreoscilla and vhb is found to have a wide range of biological and biotechnological applications including promotion of cell growth protein synthesis metabolite productivity respiration cellular detoxification fermentation and biodegradation the generic name is derived from the latin adjective vitreus which means clear or transparent and the noun oscillum meaning a swing thus vitreoscilla is used to describe the bacterium as the transparent swing or oscillator the way it exhibits locomotion there are three valid species under the genus namely members of vitreoscilla are obligate aerobic bacteria which are morphologically colourless filaments that contain cells with diameters of 1 3 m and 1 12 m long each filament may contain from 1 to 40 cells locomotion is by gliding and no special locomotor organelles are present the cell walls are composed of the amino acids alanine glutamate and diaminopimelic acid with approximate molar ratios of 2 1 1 vitreoscilla bacteria have a unique property in that they produces a type of haemoglobin vhb this molecule unlike classic haemoglobin is composed only of a single globin molecule vhb is known to have a wide variety of functions including improving cell growth protein synthesis

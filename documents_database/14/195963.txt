it is named after physicists marvin d girardeau and lewi tonks strictly speaking this is not a bose einstein condensate as it does not demonstrate any of the characteristics such as off diagonal long range order or a unitary two body correlation function even in a thermodynamic limit and as such cannot be described by a macroscopically occupied orbital order parameter in the gross pitaevskii formulation consider a row of bosons all confined to a one dimensional line they cannot pass each other and therefore cannot exchange places the resulting motion has been compared to a traffic jam the motion of each boson would be strongly correlated with that of its two neighbours this can be thought of as the large c limit of the delta bose gas because the particles cannot exchange places one might expect their behaviour to be fermionic but it turns out that their behaviour differs from that of fermions in several important ways the particles can all occupy the same momentum state which corresponds to neither bose einstein nor fermi dirac statistics this is the phenomenon of bosonization which happens in 1 1 dimensions in the case of a tonks girardeau gas tg so many

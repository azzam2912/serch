the short tube and hose barb effectively act as an adapter over which the end of a thick walled flexible hose tubing can be fitted to form a connection to the flask the other end of the hose can be connected to source of vacuum such as an aspirator vacuum pump or house vacuum preferably this is done through a trap see below which is designed to prevent the sucking back of water from the aspirator into the b chner flask the thick wall of the b chner flask provides it the strength to withstand the pressure difference while holding a vacuum inside it is primarily used together with a b chner funnel fitted through a drilled rubber bung or an elastomer adapter a b chner ring at the neck on top of the flask for the filtration of samples the b chner funnel holds the sample isolated from the suction by a layer of filter paper during filtration the filtrate enters and is held by the flask while the residue remains on the filter paper in the funnel the b chner flask can also be used as a vacuum trap in a vacuum line to ensure that no fluids

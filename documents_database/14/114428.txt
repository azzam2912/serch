this enables it to demonstrate some behavior or property of the original object without examining the original object itself the most familiar scale models represent the physical appearance of an object in miniature but there are many other kinds scale models are used in many fields including engineering architecture film making military command salesmanship and hobby model building while each field may use a scale model for a different purpose all scale models are based on the same principles and must meet the same general requirements to be functional the detail requirements vary depending on the needs of the modeler to be a true scale model all relevant aspects must be accurately modeled such as material properties so the model s interaction with the outside world is reliably related to the original object s interaction with the real world in general a scale model must be designed and built primarily considering similitude theory however other requirements concerning practical issues must also be considered similitude is the theory and art of predicting prototype original object performance from scale model observations the main requirement of similitude is all dimensionless quantities must be equal for both the scaled model and the prototype under

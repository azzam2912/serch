unlike most small skinks which have smooth scales this species has rough ridged and pointed scales these keeled scales may be an adaptation to its high rainfall habitat to its microhabitat in rotting logs or to camouflage it when moving through forest leaf litter this species concinnia queenslandiae is a member of the australian sphenomorphid group of skinks family scincidae which includes such genera as ctenotus anomalopus and eulamprus although formerly placed in the monotypic genus gnypetoscincus molecular phylogenetic studies by o connor 2003 and skinner et al 2013 demonstrated that this species forms a well supported clade that included nangura spinosa also an unusual narrowly endemic monotypic genus along with the five species of the eulamprus tenuis group among other taxonomic changes within the australian sphenomorphids skinner and co authors placed this well supported clade into the genus concinnia with the nangur spiny skink c spinosus and the prickly skink c queenslandiae as successive sister groups to the remaining species the prickly skink is a habitat specialist restricted to closed canopy forest in high rainfall areas rainforests of the australian wet tropics extending from lowland tropical rainforest to montane forests on the adjacent hills and tablelands within these rainforests

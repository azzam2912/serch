its split planes positions and orientations are not given explicitly but implicitly by some recursive splitting function defined on the hyperrectangles belonging to the tree s nodes each inner node s split plane is positioned on a grid plane of the underlying grid partitioning the node s grid into two subgrids the terms min max k d tree and implicit k d tree are sometimes mixed up this is because the first publication using the term implicit k d tree did actually use explicit min max k d trees but referred to them as implicit k d trees to indicate that they may be used to ray trace implicitly given iso surfaces nevertheless this publication used also slim k d trees which are a subset of the implicit k d trees with the restriction that they can only be built over integer hyperrectangles with sidelengths that are powers of two implicit k d trees as defined here have recently been introduced with applications in computer graphics as it is possible to assign attributes to implicit k d tree nodes one may refer to an implicit k d tree which has min max values assigned to its nodes as an implicit

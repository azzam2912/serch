the ordinary chondrites are thought to have originated from three parent asteroids with the fragments making up the h chondrite l chondrite and ll chondrite groups respectively their name comes from their relatively low iron abundance with respect to the h chondrites which are about 20 25 iron by weight historically the l chondrites have been named hypersthene chondrites or olivine hypersthene chondrites for the dominant minerals but these terms are now obsolete characteristic is the fayalite content fa in olivine of 21 to 25 mol about 4 10 iron nickel is found as a free metal making these meteorites magnetic but not as strongly as the h chondrites the most abundant minerals are olivine and hypersthene an orthopyroxene as well as iron nickel and troilite chromite sodium rich feldspar and calcium phosphates occur in minor amounts petrologic type 6 dominates with over 60 of the l chondrites falling into this class this indicates that the parent body was sizeable enough greater than in diameter to experience strong heating many of the l chondrite meteors may have their origin in the ordovician meteor event radioisotope dated with uranium lead at around 467 50 0 28 million years ago compared to

in fact for all formula 6 since the sequence formula 5 is decreasing and bounded below by 0 it converges to a non negative limit indeed the limit is zero see below by means of integration by parts a recurrence relation can be obtained using the identity formula 10 we have for all formula 11 integrating the second integral by parts with we have substituting this result into equation 1 gives and thus for all formula 20 this is a recurrence relation giving formula 21 in terms of formula 22 this together with the values of formula 23 and formula 24 give us two sets of formulae for the terms in the sequence formula 5 depending on whether formula 26 is odd or even wallis s integrals can be evaluated by using euler integrals if we make the following substitution inside the beta function formula 31 we obtain so this gives us the following relation to evaluate the wallis integrals so for odd formula 26 writing formula 35 we have whereas for even formula 26 writing formula 38 and knowing that formula 39 we get suppose that we have the following equivalence known as stirling s formula for some constant

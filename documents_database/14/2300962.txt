this is an exact solution to the navier stokes equations which was first discovered by lev landau in 1944 and later by herbert squire in 1951 the self similar equation was in fact first derived by n a slezkin in 1934 but never applied to the jet following landau s work v i yatseyev obtained the general solution of the equation in 1950 the problem is described in spherical coordinates formula 1 with velocity components formula 2 the flow is axisymmetric i e independent of formula 3 then the continuity equation and the incompressible navier stokes equations reduce to where a self similar description is available for the solution in the following form substituting the above self similar form into the governing equations and using the boundary conditions formula 7 at infinity one finds the form for pressure as where formula 9 is a constant using this pressure we find again from the momentum equation replacing formula 11 by formula 12 as independent variable the velocities become for brevity the same symbol is used for formula 14 and formula 15 even though they are functionally the same but takes different numerical values and the equation becomes after two integrations the

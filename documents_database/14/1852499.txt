its core kernel contributed to the illumos project it features several technologies crossbow dtrace kvm zfs and zones unlike other illumos distributions smartos employs netbsd pkgsrc package management smartos is designed to be particularly suitable for building clouds and generating appliances it is developed for and by joyent but is open source and free for anyone to use smartos is an in memory operating system and boots directly into random access memory it supports various boot mechanisms such as booting from usb thumbdrive iso image or over the network via pxe boot one of the many benefits of employing this boot mechanism is that operating system upgrades are trivial simply requiring a reboot from a newer smartos image version smartos follows a strict local node storage architecture this means that virtual machines are stored locally on each node and do not boot over the network from a central san or nas this helps ensure that network latency issues are eliminated as well as to preserve node independence multi node smartos clouds can be managed via the open source joyent triton datacenter formerly known as smartdatacenter cloud orchestration suite or via the project fifo open source smartos cloud management platform built

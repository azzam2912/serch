the research and development of this vehicle was funded by the united states office of naval research onr and it became the us navy s first autonomous underwater vehicle auv the navy used a total of 7 spurv vehicles until 1979 the original engineers of spurv were bob van wagennen mechanical and wayne nodland electrical terry ewart calculated the hydrodynamics design on a berkeley ease analog computer spurv was machined by boeing from a forging of 7078 t6 aluminum spurv had an operating depth of at least 3000 meters and a maximum depth of 3600 meters it could go about 4 5 knots for about 4 hours a propulsion battery consisting of 2 sets of 16 silver zinc cells connected in a parallel through diodes was the primary power source for spurv the battery provided a 24 volt 200 ampere hour supply secondary power came from 4 solid state converters acoustic signals from the accompanying research vessel guided spurv in moving below the surface of the water spurv then generated models of underwater physical properties such as ocean currents and temperature spurv was first operated from the ata 195 the navy seagoing tug tatnuck in a 1957 cruise to cobb

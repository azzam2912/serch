more precisely the pl cker map embeds formula 1 algebraically into the projective space of the formula 3th exterior power of that vector space formula 4 the image is the intersection of a number of quadrics defined by the pl cker relations the pl cker embedding was first defined in the case k 2 n 4 by julius pl cker as a way of describing the lines in three dimensional space which as projective lines in real projective space correspond to two dimensional subspaces of a four dimensional vector space the image of that embedding is the klein quadric in rp hermann grassmann generalized pl cker s embedding to arbitrary k and n the homogeneous coordinates of the image of the grassmannian formula 1 under the pl cker embedding relative to the natural basis in the exterior space formula 6corresponding to the natural basis in formula 7 where formula 8 is the base field are called pl cker coordinates the pl cker embedding over the field k is the map defined by where gr k k is the grassmannian i e the space of all k dimensional subspaces of the n dimensional vector space k this is an isomorphism from

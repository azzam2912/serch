it removes unwanted room related resonances modes over a wide listening area a dba requires at least two subwoofers preferably same make and model that are placed at opposing walls in a specific layout the subwoofer array on the back wall is inverted and delayed based on the distance to the frontal subwoofer array this will actively absorb any reflected sound modes between side walls floor and ceiling are suppressed by arranging the subwoofer in a specific grid formula 1 formula 2 formula 3 wall width formula 4 wall height formula 5 horizontal distance from wall formula 6 for n 0 in picture formula 7 vertical distance from wall formula 8 for n 0 in picture formula 9 number of subwoofers horizontally formula 10 number of subwoofers vertically counter formula 11 with this specific grid layout reflections from the walls act as mirror sources interference of the subwoofers and mirror sources create a plane wave up to a certain frequency the more sources the higher the frequency this cutoff frequency formula 12 can be calculated for each dimension as follows formula 13 formula 14 speed of sound formula 15 distance between subwoofers example a 2 2 array on a wall

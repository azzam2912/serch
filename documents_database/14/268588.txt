let s be a particular set theory for example the zfc axioms and let t possibly the same as s also be a theory in formula 2 if m is a model for s and n is a formula 2 structure such that then we say that n is an inner model of t in m usually t will equal or subsume s so that n is a model for s inside the model m of s if only conditions 1 and 2 hold n is called a standard model of t in m a standard submodel of t if s t a model n of t in m is called transitive when it is standard and condition 3 holds if the axiom of foundation is not assumed that is is not in s all three of these concepts are given the additional condition that n be well founded hence inner models are transitive transitive models are standard and standard models are well founded the assumption that there exists a standard submodel of zfc in a given universe is stronger than the assumption that there exists a model in fact if there is a standard submodel then there is a

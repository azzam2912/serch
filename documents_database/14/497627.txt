the reaction product is a vicinal diol the reaction is named after pinacol also known as 2 3 dimethyl 2 3 butanediol or tetramethylethylene glycol which is the product of this reaction when done with acetone as reagent the reaction is usually a homocoupling but intramolecular cross coupling reactions are also possible pinacol was discovered by wilhelm rudolph fittig in 1859 the first step in the reaction mechanism is one electron reduction of the carbonyl group by a reducing agent such as magnesium to a ketyl radical anion species two ketyl groups react in a coupling reaction yielding a vicinal diol with both hydroxyl groups deprotonated addition of water or another proton donor gives the diol with magnesium as an electron donor the initial reaction product is a 5 membered cyclic compound with the two oxygen atoms coordinated to the oxidized mg ion this complex is also broken up by addition of water with formation of magnesium hydroxide the pinacol coupling can be followed up by a pinacol rearrangement a related reaction is the mcmurry reaction which uses titanium iii chloride or titanium iv chloride in conjunction with a reducing agent for the formation of the metal diol complex and

it is a flammable liquid with a foul odor which is detectable at levels as low as 1 part per trillion dimethyl trisulfide has been found in volatiles emitted from cooked onion leek and other allium species from broccoli and cabbage as well as from limburger cheese and is involved in the unpalatable aroma of aged beer and stale japanese sake it is a decomposition product of bacterial decomposition including the early stages of human decomposition and is a major attractant for blowflies looking for hosts dimethyl trisulfide along with dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide have been confirmed as volatile compounds given off by the fly attracting plant known as dead horse arum helicodiceros muscivorus these flies are attracted to the odor of fetid meat and help pollinate this plant dmts contributes to the foul odor given off by the fungus phallus impudicus also known as the common stinkhorn dmts causes the characteristic malodorous smell of a fungating lesion e g from cancer wounds and contributes to the odor of human feces dmts can be synthesized by the reaction of methanethiol with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of copper ii and with sulfur dichloride among other methods on heating at

the enzyme employs a unique four electron transfer at its fe ii fe iii coordination sites and the reaction proceeds through the direct binding of myo inositol followed by attack of the iron center by diatomic oxygen this enzyme is part of the only known pathway for the catabolism of inositol in humans and is expressed primarily in the kidneys recent medical research regarding miox has focused on understanding its role in metabolic and kidney diseases such as diabetes obesity and acute kidney injury industrially focused engineering efforts are centered on improving miox activity in order to produce glucaric acid in heterologous hosts myo inositol oxygenase is a monomeric 33 kda protein in both solution and crystal this enzyme possesses a fe ii fe iii atomic pair at the catalytic active site which enables its unique four electron transfer mechanism recent crystallization studies have elucidated the structures of the mouse miox in 2006 followed by the human miox in 2008 the overall structure of the mouse miox is primarily helical with five alpha helices forming the core of the protein like other di iron oxygenases the iron coordination centers are buried deep inside the protein presumably to protect the cell

government the goal was to replace the space shuttle by developing a re usable spaceplane that could launch satellites into orbit at a fraction of the cost while the requirement was for an unmanned launcher it was expected to carry passengers as cargo the venturestar would have had a wingspan of a length of and would have weighed roughly 1000 t 2 2 million lb venturestar was intended to be a commercial single stage to orbit vehicle that would launch vertically but return to earth as an airplane flights would have been leased to nasa as needed after failures with the x 33 subscale technology demonstrator test vehicle funding was cancelled in 2001 venturestar was essentially a bigger version of the x 33 but was not produced the x 33 had ongoing problems meeting performance requirements for the hydrogen carbon fiber fuel tank there were a number of other technologies that were part of the program including the linear aerospike rocket engine and one point of praise was the metallic thermal protection system invented by bf goodrich for the launch system venturestar s engineering and design would have offered numerous advantages over the space shuttle representing considerable savings in time

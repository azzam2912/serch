liquid marbles are also found naturally aphids convert honeydew droplets into marbles a variety of non organic and organic liquids may be converted into liquid marbles liquid marbles demonstrate elastic properties and do not coalesce when bounced or pressed lightly liquid marbles demonstrate a potential as micro reactors micro containers for growing micro organisms and cells micro fluidics devices and have even been used in unconventional computing liquid marbles remain stable on solid and liquid surfaces statics and dynamics of rolling and bouncing of liquid marbles were reported liquid marbles coated with poly disperse and mono disperse particles have been reported liquid marbles are not hermetically coated by solid particles but connected to the gaseous phase kinetics of the evaporation of liquid marbles has been investigated liquid marbles were first reported by p aussillous and d quere in 2001 who described a new method to construct portable water droplets in the atmospheric environment with hydrophobic coating on their surface to prevent the contact between water and the solid ground figure 1 liquid marbles provide a new approach to transport liquid mass on the solid surface which sufficiently transform the inconvenient glass containers into flexible user specified hydrophobic coating composed of

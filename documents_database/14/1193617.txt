this enzyme inhibits apoptosis by catalyzing adp atp exchange across the mitochondrial membranes and regulating membrane potential in particular ant4 is essential to spermatogenesis as it imports atp into sperm mitochondria to support their development and survival outside this role the slc25ac31 gene has not been implicated in any human disease the ant4 protein contains six transmembrane helices and a homodimer functional unit which serves as an adp atp channel protein unlike the other three ant isoforms ant4 has additional amino acids at its n and c terminals these amino acid sequences may interact with different factors for specialized functions such as localization to sperm flagella the slc25a31 gene is composed of 6 exons over a stretch of 44 kbp of dna the ant4 protein is a mitochondrial adp atp carrier that catalyzes the exchange of adp and atp between the mitochondrial matrix and cytoplasm during atp synthesis in addition ant4 stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane potential and decreases the permeability transition pore complex ptpc opening in order to prevent nuclear chromatin fragmentation and resulting cell death in humans the protein localizes to the liver brain and testis though in adult males it is expressed primarily in the testis studies on

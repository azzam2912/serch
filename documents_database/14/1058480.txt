this extension adds connectives specifically designed for combining simple actions into complex transactions and for providing control over their execution the logic has a natural model theory and a sound and complete proof theory transaction logic has a horn clause subset which has a procedural as well as a declarative semantics the important features of the logic include hypothetical and committed updates dynamic constraints on transaction execution non determinism and bulk updates in this way transaction logic is able to declaratively capture a number of non logical phenomena including procedural knowledge in artificial intelligence active databases and methods with side effects in object databases transaction logic was originally proposed in by anthony bonner and michael kifer and later described in more detail in and the most comprehensive description appears in in later years transaction logic was extended in various ways including concurrency defeasible reasoning partially defined actions and other features in 2013 the original paper on transaction logic has won the 20 year test of time award as the most influential paper from the proceedings of iclp 1993 conference in the preceding 20 years graph coloring here tinsert denotes the elementary update operation of transactional insert the connective is called

most zero length launch experiments took place in the 1950s during the cold war the primary advantage of a zero length launch system is the elimination of the need for a vulnerable airfield for takeoffs in the event of a sudden attack air forces could field effective air defenses and launch airstrikes even with their own airbases destroyed although launching aircraft using rocket boosters proved to be relatively trouble free if aircraft were required to land at the same base a runway was still required bulky mobile launching platforms also proved to be expensive to operate and difficult to transport security would also have been an issue with mobile launchers especially if equipped with nuclear armed strike fighters the united states air force the bundeswehr s luftwaffe and the soviets vvs all conducted experiments in zero length launching the first manned aircraft to be zell launched was an f 84g in 1955 the soviets main interest in zell was for point defense format protection of airfields and critical targets using mig 19s the american tests with the f 84s started with using the martin mgm 1 matador solid fuel boost motor of some 240 kilonewton 52 000 lbf thrust output

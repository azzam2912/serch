in series physical morphological or chemical characteristics and information about the relative order or absolute age of the spines or thorns is used to study past climate or plant physiology for example columnar cactus spines grow from the apex of the plant after several weeks the spines stop growing and have been moved to the side of the stem the old spines remain in place for decades as new spines are created at the continually growing apex the result is that along each external rib of the cactus is a series of spines arranged in the order they grew in the oldest spines are at the bottom and the youngest spines are at the top these spines can be dated using bomb spike carbon 14 and isotopes of carbon carbon 13 and oxygen oxygen 18 may be used to infer past climate e g precipitation or temperature plant stem growth or plant physiology e g photosynthetic processes alternatively the width of small transverse bands in the spine may be used to infer daily information about cloud cover or plant productivity although this remains to be tested it has also been shown that regular waxy banding on the sides of a

leading hypotheses suggest that a combination of limited resources and environmental causes determine an optimal level of repair regarding molecular and cellular level damage that accumulates over time this process is known as self maintenance august weismann was responsible for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of darwinian evolution in a modern theoretical framework in 1889 he theorized that ageing was part of life s program to make room for the next generation in order to sustain the turnover that is necessary for evolution the idea that the ageing characteristic was selected an adaptation because of its deleterious effect was largely discounted for much of the 20th century but a theoretical model suggests that altruistic ageing could evolve if there is little migration among populations weismann later abandoned his theory and later followed up with his programmed death theory the first modern theory of mammal ageing was formulated by peter medawar in 1952 this theory formed in the previous decade with j b s haldane and his selection shadow concept their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect as nature is a highly competitive place almost all animals die in the wild from predators disease or accidents which lowers

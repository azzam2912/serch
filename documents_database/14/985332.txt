its most important application is to complex semisimple lie algebras or equivalently compact semisimple lie groups the case described in this article multiplicities in irreducible representations tensor products and branching rules can be calculated using a coloured directed graph with labels given by the simple roots of the lie algebra developed as a bridge between the theory of crystal bases arising from the work of kashiwara and lusztig on quantum groups and the standard monomial theory of c s seshadri and lakshmibai littelmann s path model associates to each irreducible representation a rational vector space with basis given by paths from the origin to a weight as well as a pair of root operators acting on paths for each simple root this gives a direct way of recovering the algebraic and combinatorial structures previously discovered by kashiwara and lusztig using quantum groups some of the basic questions in the representation theory of complex semisimple lie algebras or compact semisimple lie groups going back to hermann weyl include answers to these questions were first provided by hermann weyl and richard brauer as consequences of explicit character formulas followed by later combinatorial formulas of hans freudenthal robert steinberg and bertram kostant see

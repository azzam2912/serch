rab gtpases such as rab11 are enzymes that are involved in vesicular trafficking rab11 specifically plays a key role in endocytic trafficking and recycling through guiding early endosomes to endosome recycling complexes rab11fip5 like most other rab11fip proteins interacts with rab11 by serving as an adaptor protein this leads to downstream changes with regards to which proteins can interact this is a result of the various rab11fip proteins that each have different binding partners this process allows for the coordination and organization of endosomal transport and ultimately gives rab11 its versatile function in the cell it is believed that rab11 recruits specific rab11fip proteins to the surface of vesicles in order to determine how the vesicle will behave studies have shown that rab11fip5 localizes to the perinuclear endosomes where it aids in sorting vesicles into the slow recycling route this process involves the transport of cargo proteins like endocytosed receptors to endosome recycling complexes and subsequently to the plasma membrane this is in contrast to the fast constitutive recycling route which allows for the direct transport of cargo from the endosome to the plasma membrane rab11fip5 aids in this sorting process by binding to kinesin ii and forming a protein

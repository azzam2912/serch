there were three waves of cultural assimilation in assam first it was the tibeto burman ethnic groups which had arrived from tibet yunnan and sinchuan provinces of china who mixed with the scarcely present aboriginal austric people like the khasi and jaintia then there was a wave of indo aryans from northern india which brought the vedic culture into assam and mixed with tantric culture of bodo kachari people the last wave of migration was that of the tai ahoms tai shan who added another chapter to the assamese culture the ahoms later on brought some more indo aryans like the assamese brahmins and ganaks and assamese kayasthas to assam according to the epic mahabharata and on the basis of local folk lore people of assam kiratas probably lived in a strong kingdom under the himalayas in the era before jesus christ which led to an early assimilation of various tibeto burman and autro asiatic ethnic groups on a greater scale typical naming of the rivers and spatial distribution of related ethno cultural groups also support this theory thereafter western migrations of indo aryans such as those of various branches of irano scythians and nordics along with mixed northern indians

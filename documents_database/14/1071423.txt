this image warping avoids any restrictions when displaying it together with video from multiple radar sources or with other geographical data including scanned maps and satellite images which may be provided in a particular projection there are many areas where geo warping has unique benefits radar video presents the echoes of electromagnetic waves a radar system has emitted and received as reflections afterwards these echoes are typically presented on a computer screen with a color coding scheme depicting the reflection strength two problems have to be solved during such a visualization process the first problem arises from the fact that typically the radar antenna turns around its position and measures the reflection echo distances from its position in one direction this effectively means that the radar video data are present in polar coordinates in older systems the polar oriented picture has been displayed in so called plan position indicators ppi the ppi scope uses a radial sweep pivoting about the center of the presentation this results in a map like picture of the area covered by the radar beam a long persistence screen is used so that the display remains visible until the sweep passes again bearing to the target

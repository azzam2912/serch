some philosophers believe causation relates facts not events in which case the meaning is adjusted accordingly some philosophers believe that causality may not exist if determinism is true as causality is merely the observation that one event precedes another or that there is a pattern throughout spacetime in which events of one similar type tend to correlate with events of another similar type that is the mass energy distribution in spacetime has an information theoretic pattern where car crashes tend to be correlated with injury say there may be no ultimate reason for why a chain of causality occurs the way that it does beyond the fact that a chain of causality exists the fact that certain events seem to cause other events is the recognition of a pattern in the structure of spacetime and the mass energy that exists in spacetime which is ultimately either due or an instantiation of the laws of physics note stating that causality does not exist may be a bit misleading as one would have to define what is meant by causality it may be that causality is dependent upon counterfactual definiteness that is a causes b because if a did not occur then

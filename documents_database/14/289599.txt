the oxygen and nh are the 1 and 3 positions respectively in oxazolidine derivatives there is always a carbon between the oxygen and the nitrogen or it would be an isoxazolidine all of the carbons in oxazolidines are reduced compare to oxazole and oxazoline some of their derivatives the oxazolidinediones are used as anticonvulsants oxazolidines were first synthesized over 100 years ago oxazolidines that are the precursor to bisoxazolidines are in effect mono oxazolidines they are also used as moisture scavengers in polyurethane and other systems oxazolidines where the carbon centers at the 1 and 3 positions are carbonyls are called dioxooxazolidines some of these are commercial fungicides including chlozolinate vinclozolin and famoxadone bisoxazolidines are chemical compounds that contain two oxazolidine rings they are used as performance modifiers in polyurethane coatings and paints the rings hydrolyze in the presence of moisture to give amine and hydroxyl groups these can then react with diisocyanates polyisocyanates and polyurethane prepolymers to form a coating the use of a bisoxazolidine in a polyurethane systems can prevent the unwanted reaction between isocyanate and moisture resulting in coating defects as a result of carbon dioxide release this moisture triggered curing route is preferential to moisture cure

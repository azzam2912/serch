like most of the methods in the area of evolutionary computation ica does not need the gradient of the function in its optimization process from a specific point of view ica can be thought of as the social counterpart of genetic algorithms gas ica is the mathematical model and the computer simulation of human social evolution while gas are based on the biological evolution of species figure 1 shows the flowchart of the imperialist competitive algorithm this algorithm starts by generating a set of candidate random solutions in the search space of the optimization problem the generated random points are called the initial countries countries in this algorithm are the counterpart of chromosome s in gas and particle s in particle swarm optimization pso and it is an array of values of a candidate solution of optimization problem the cost function of the optimization problem determines the power of each country based on their power some of the best initial countries the countries with the least cost function value become imperialists and start taking control of other countries called colonies and form the initial empires two main operators of this algorithm are assimilation and revolution assimilation makes the colonies of

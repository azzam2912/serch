the family gets its name from the genus desmarestia which is named after the french zoologist anselme ga tan desmarest 1784 1838 there are three genera in this family two are monotypic himantothallus species name himantothallus grandifolius and phaeurus species name phaeurus antarcticus these are both endemic to antarctica the third genus desmarestia has 30 to 40 species most species have narrow localized ranges but some desmarestia such as d ligulata and d viridis have disjunct but global distributions it is thought that the family began its evolution in the southern hemisphere and radiated north it is now distributed across much of the world but is largely absent from tropical regions an exception being the possibly extinct d tropica of the gal pagos islands these algae require colder water temperatures for the successful production of gametes species of the desmarestiaceae can grow large with the thallus the plantlike main part of the alga reaching maximum lengths around 10 meters they can be flattened or cylindrical and narrow or many branched they are oogamous with microscopic gametophytes the thalli of some desmarestia contain vacuoles of sulfuric acid with a ph as low as 0 44 these likely evolved to deter predators

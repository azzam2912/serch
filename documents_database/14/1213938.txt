it consists of a housing that contains lasers mirrors galvanometer scanners and other optical components a laser projector can contain one laser light source for single color projection or three sources for rgb red green and blue full color projection lasers offer potentially brighter projected images with more and better colors there are actually two types of laser projectors the industrial laser projectors are on the market since about 2002 2003 laser projectors are mainly used as optical guidance systems they enable working without templates in many manufacturing processes by showing directly on the workpiece how material needs to be positioned or mounted like that the employee is led by manual or semiautomatic productional processes visually depending on material to project on different colors can be used home entertainment laser projectors have been on the market since about 2015 these devices are able to generate any wavelength of light thus making wider color gamuts possible without compromising brightness this translates to deeper richer colors that come closer than previous products to the vast range of colors human eyes can process other benefits include fast up to instant on off and increased longevity one manufacturer for example claims 30 000 hours

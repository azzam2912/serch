if a visual stimulus appears in the left visual field lvf the visual information is initially projected to the right cerebral hemisphere rh and conversely if a visual stimulus appears in the right visual field rvf the visual information is initially received by the left cerebral hemisphere lh in this way if a cerebral hemisphere has functional advantages with some aspect of a particular task an experimenter might observe improvements in task performance when the visual information is presented on the contralateral visual field the divided visual field paradigm capitalizes on the lateralization of the visual system each cerebral hemisphere only receives information from one half of the visual field specifically from the contralateral hemifield for example retinal projections from ganglion cells in the left eye that receive information from the left visual field cross to the right hemisphere at the optic chiasm while information from the right visual field received by the left eye will not cross at the optic chiasm and will remain on the left hemisphere stimuli presented on the right visual field rvf will ultimately be processed first by the left hemisphere s lh occipital cortex while stimuli presented of the left visual field lvf will

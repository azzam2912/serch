it permits the calculation of curvature and metric properties of a surface such as length and area in a manner consistent with the ambient space the first fundamental form is denoted by the roman numeral let be a parametric surface then the inner product of two tangent vectors is where and are the coefficients of the first fundamental form the first fundamental form may be represented as a symmetric matrix when the first fundamental form is written with only one argument it denotes the inner product of that vector with itself the first fundamental form is often written in the modern notation of the metric tensor the coefficients may then be written as the components of this tensor are calculated as the scalar product of tangent vectors and for see example below the first fundamental form completely describes the metric properties of a surface thus it enables one to calculate the lengths of curves on the surface and the areas of regions on the surface the line element may be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the first fundamental form as the classical area element given by can be expressed in terms of the first fundamental form with the

ash1l is the human homolog of drosophila ash1 absent small or homeotic like ash1 was discovered as a gene causing an imaginal disc mutant phenotype in drosophila ash1 is a member of the trithorax group trxg of proteins a group of transcriptional activators that are involved in regulating hox gene expression and body segment identity drosophila ash1 interacts with trithorax to regulate ultrabithorax expression the human ash1l gene spans 227 5 kb on chromosome 1 band q22 this region is rearranged in a variety of human cancers such as leukemia non hodgkin s lymphoma and some solid tumors the gene is expressed in multiple tissues with highest levels in brain kidney and heart as a 10 5 kb mrna transcript human ash1l protein is 2969 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 333 kda ash1l has an associated with set domain aws a set domain a post set domain a bromodomain a bromo adjacent homology domain and a plant homeodomain finger human and drosophila ash1 share 66 and 77 similarity in their set and phd finger domains respectively a bromodomain is not present in drosophila ash1 the set domain is responsible for ash1l s histone methyltransferase hmtase activity unlike

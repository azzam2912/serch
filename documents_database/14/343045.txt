usually motors are built to achieve maximum torque at high rotational speeds usually 1500 or 3000 rpm while this is useful for many applications such as an electric fan other mechanisms need a relatively high torque at very low speeds such as a phonograph turntable which needs a constant and very precise 33 rpm or 45 rpm the slow motor also needs to be physically larger than its faster counterpart for example in a belt coupled turntable the motor diameter is about on a direct drive turntable the motor is about also direct drive mechanisms need a more precise control mechanism high speed motors with speed reduction have relatively high inertia which helps smooth the output motion most motors exhibit positional torque ripple known as cogging torque in high speed motors this effect is usually negligible as the frequency at which it occurs is too high to significantly affect system performance direct drive units will suffer more from this phenomenon unless additional inertia is added i e by a flywheel or the system uses feedback to actively counter the effect direct drive mechanisms are present in several products

the program resulted in commercial development and deployment of the power 775 a supercomputer design with extremely high performance ratios in fabric and memory bandwidth as well as very high performance density and power efficiency ibm officially announced the power 775 on july 12 2011 and started to ship systems in august 2011 the hpcs program was a three phase research and development effort ibm was one of three companies along with cray and sun microsystems that received the hpcs grant for phase ii in this phase ibm collaborated with a consortium of 12 universities and the los alamos national lab to pursue an adaptable computing system with the goal of commercial viability of new chip technology new computer architecture operating systems compiler and programming environments ibm was chosen for phase iii in november 2006 and granted 244 million in funds for continuing development of percs technology and delivering prototype systems by 2010 the first supercomputer using percs technology was intended to be the blue waters system however the high costs and complexity of the system resulted in its contract being canceled the machine was subsequently delivered by cray inc using a combination of gpus and cpus for processing and

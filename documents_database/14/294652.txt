in general it is used to incorporate food ingredients enzymes cells or other materials on a micro metric scale microencapsulation can also be used to enclose solids liquids or gases inside a micrometric wall made of hard or soft soluble film in order to reduce dosing frequency and prevent the degradation of pharmaceuticals in a relatively simple form a microcapsule is a small sphere with a uniform wall around it the material inside the microcapsule is referred to as the core internal phase or fill whereas the wall is sometimes called a shell coating or membrane some materials like lipids and polymers such as alginate may be used as a mixture to trap the material of interest inside most microcapsules have pores with diameters between a few micrometers and a few millimeters the coating materials generally used for coating are the definition has been expanded and includes most foods where the encapsulation of flavors is the most common the technique of microencapsulation depends on the physical and chemical properties of the material to be encapsulated many microcapsules however bear little resemblance to these simple spheres the core may be a crystal a jagged adsorbent particle an emulsion a pickering emulsion

there are also an unknown number of non convex star forms regular 4 polytopes are a subset of the uniform 4 polytopes which satisfy additional requirements regular 4 polytopes can be expressed with schl fli symbol p q r have cells of type formula 1 faces of type p edge figures r and vertex figures q r the existence of a regular 4 polytope p q r is constrained by the existence of the regular polyhedra p q which becomes cells and q r which becomes the vertex figure existence as a finite 4 polytope is dependent upon an inequality the 16 regular 4 polytopes with the property that all cells faces edges and vertices are congruent there are 5 fundamental mirror symmetry point group families in 4 dimensions a b d f h there are also 3 prismatic groups aa ba ha and duoprismatic groups i p i q each group defined by a goursat tetrahedron fundamental domain bounded by mirror planes each reflective uniform 4 polytope can be constructed in one or more reflective point group in 4 dimensions by a wythoff construction represented by rings around permutations of nodes in a coxeter diagram mirror hyperplanes can be

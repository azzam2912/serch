the cell bodies of sensory neurons known as first order neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia the axons of dorsal root ganglion neurons are known as afferents in the peripheral nervous system afferents refer to the axons that relay sensory information into the central nervous system i e the brain and the spinal cord these neurons are of the pseudo unipolar type meaning they have an axon with two branches that act as a single axon often referred to as a distal process and a proximal process unlike the majority of neurons found in the central nervous system an action potential in posterior root ganglion neuron may initiate in the distal process in the periphery bypass the cell body and continue to propagate along the proximal process until reaching the synaptic terminal in the posterior horn of spinal cord the distal section of the axon may either be a bare nerve ending or encapsulated by a structure that helps relay specific information to nerve two examples where the nerve ending of the distal process is encapsulated as such are meissner s corpuscles which render the distal processes of mechanosensory neurons sensitive to stroking only and pacinian corpuscles which

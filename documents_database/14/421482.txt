in fact they form the basis of the so called bohemian school of chess composition most fruitful in threemovers and moremovers model mates are very usual in helpmates and they appear often in selfmates too this example shows a problem by miroslav havel the 1 bc5 gives a flight square for the black king and threatens 2 rxf6 ke4 3 nf2 with a model mate the main variations end with model mates from white batteries there are several other variations after 1 ne4 and 1 ke6 which do not end with model mates and allow for multiple continuations in the bohemian school they are irrelevant as long as they end with a mate in a prescribed number of moves this example shows a helpmate in which both sides cooperate to achieve a mate to the black king it has two solutions ending in model mates black moves first in helpmates if all units of both colours are involved in a model mate then it is an ideal mate both mates in the presented helpmate are ideal mates

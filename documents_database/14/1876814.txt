this notion is often used with g being a lie group and x a homogeneous space for g foundational examples are hyperbolic manifolds and affine manifolds let formula 1 be a connected differential manifold and formula 2 be a subgroup of the group of diffeomorphisms of formula 1 which act analytically in the following sense this definition is inspired by the analytic continuation property of analytic diffeomorphisms on an analytic manifold a formula 9 structure on a topological space formula 10 is a manifold structure on formula 10 whose atlas charts has values in formula 1 and transition maps belong to formula 2 this means that there exists such that every transition map formula 18 is the restriction of a diffeomorphism in formula 2 two such structures formula 20 are equivalent when they are contained in a maximal one equivalently when their union is also a formula 9 structure i e the maps formula 22 and formula 23 are restrictions of diffeomorphisms in formula 2 if formula 2 is a lie group and formula 1 a riemannian manifold with a faithful action of formula 2 by isometries then the action is analytic usually one takes formula 2 to be the

air density like air pressure decreases with increasing altitude it also changes with variation in atmospheric pressure temperature and humidity at 1013 25 hpa abs and 15 c air has a density of approximately 1 225 kg m 0 001225 g cm 0 0023769 slug cu ft 0 0765 lb cu ft according to isa international standard atmosphere air density is a property used in many branches of science engineering and industry including aeronautics gravimetric analysis the air conditioning industry atmospheric research and meteorology agricultural engineering modeling and tracking of soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models and the engineering community that deals with compressed air depending on the measuring instruments used different sets of equations for the calculation of the density of air can be applied air is a mixture of gases and the calculations always simplify to a greater or lesser extent the properties of the mixture the density of dry air can be calculated using the ideal gas law expressed as a function of temperature and pressure where the specific gas constant for dry air is 287 058 j kg k in si units and 53 35 ft lbf lb r in united states customary and imperial units

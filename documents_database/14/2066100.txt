rlwe is more properly called learning with errors over rings and is simply the larger learning with errors lwe problem specialized to polynomial rings over finite fields because of the presumed difficulty of solving the rlwe problem even on a quantum computer rlwe based cryptography may form the fundamental base for public key cryptography in the future just as the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problem have served as the base for public key cryptography since the early 1980s an important feature of basing cryptography on the ring learning with errors problem is the fact that the solution to the rlwe problem may be reducible to the np hard shortest vector problem svp in a lattice the security of modern cryptography in particular public key cryptography is based on the assumed intractability of solving certain computational problems if the size of the problem is large enough and the instance of the problem to be solved is chosen randomly the classic example that has been used since the 1970s is the integer factorization problem it is believed that it is computationally intractable to factor the product of two prime numbers if those prime numbers are large enough and chosen at random

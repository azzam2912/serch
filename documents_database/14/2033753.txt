the original is known through three contemporary copies from his workshop they were completed in 1438 1439 and 1440 with the first and last in bruges and the 1439 version in munich from these reproductions we can deduce its small scale and that the panel evidenced the master s usual unflinching approach to physiognomy of its origin or commission we know nothing unusually he presents an idealised and straightforward iconographic image of christ although emotive the panel follows a very traditional presentation of christ in the hieratical manner facing directly out of the space the usual title vera icon refers to the eastern tradition of icons in the without hands convention each of the canonical extant copies has a form of signature by van eyck the berlin inscription reads johes de eyck me fecit et applevit anno 1438 3i januarij the version in bruges reads johes de eyck annov 1438 3i januarij and yet it differs in two manners from representation of the late 14th and early 15th centuries in its physiological exactness and illusionistic frames like many of his surviving works the panel contains a heavily inscribed fictive frame painted around the portrait in each contemporary copy the background

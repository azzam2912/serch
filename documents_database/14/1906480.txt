one provision of this law required that all technological standards incorporated by reference in guidelines and regulation to be available free of charge on the internet the technology standards in question related to pipeline safety many of these technical standards are created by standards development organizations sdos the law mandated that if any of the standards created by these organizations were used or referenced in the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration s guidelines or regulations the standards had to be put on the internet and available for free this created a conflict by requiring these sdos to give up trade secrets and lose revenue from selling their standards this in turn might have prevented them from continuing to update and develop new standards h r 2576 makes three main changes to the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 first it extends the deadline from 1 year to 3 years to give the pipeline industry and the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration more time to organize and release these standards in a public manner second it removes the word guidance from the law which would reduce the number of documents that must be available online

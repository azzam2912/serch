it is of theoretical interest as one of the simplest non benzenoid conjugated hydrocarbons fulvalene is an unstable isomer of the more common benzenoid aromatic compounds naphthalene and azulene fulvalene consists of two 5 membered rings each with two double bonds joined by yet a fifth double bond it has d symmetry an earlier attempt at synthesis of fulvalene in 1951 by pauson and kealy resulted in the accidental discovery of ferrocene its synthesis was first reported in 1958 by e a matzner working under william von eggers doering in this method cyclopentadienyl anion is coupled with iodine to the dihydrofulvalene which is then doubly deprotonated with n butyllithium to the dianion and then oxidized with oxygen fulvalene was spectroscopically observed at 77 k from photolysis of diazocyclopentadiene dimerization of two cyclopentadiene carbenes with uv spectra matching those obtained by the doering group final isolation of the compound came in 1986 via a method similar to that of doering the compound was found to be nonaromatic and extremely reactive above 50 c through diels alder dimerization perchlorofulvalene ccl is quite stable in contrast to the hydrocarbon tetrathiafulvalene is an organic semiconductor

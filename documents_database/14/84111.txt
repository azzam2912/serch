it is defined as the distance that light travels in free space in one second and is equal to exactly just as the second forms the basis for other units of time the light second can form the basis for other units of length ranging from the light nanosecond 299 8 mm or just under one international foot to the light minute light hour and light day which are sometimes used in popular science publications the more commonly used light year is also presently defined to be equal to precisely light seconds since the definition of a year is based on a julian year not gregorian year of exactly 365 25 days each of exactly si seconds communications signals on earth rarely travel at precisely the speed of light in free space distances in fractions of a light second are useful for planning telecommunications networks the light second is a convenient unit for measuring distances in the inner solar system since it corresponds very closely to the radiometric data used to determine them the match is not exact for an earth based observer because of a very small correction for the effects of relativity the value of the astronomical unit

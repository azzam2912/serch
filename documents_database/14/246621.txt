an example of this would be adam12 which plays a significant role in the fusion of muscle cells during embryo development in a process known as myogenesis most metalloproteases require zinc but some use cobalt the metal ion is coordinated to the protein via three ligands the ligands co ordinating the metal ion can vary with histidine glutamate aspartate lysine and arginine the fourth coordination position is taken up by a labile water molecule treatment with chelating agents such as edta leads to complete inactivation edta is a metal chelator that removes zinc which is essential for activity they are also inhibited by the chelator orthophenanthroline there are two subgroups of metalloproteinases in the merops database peptidase families are grouped by their catalytic type the first character representing the catalytic type a aspartic c cysteine g glutamic acid m metallo s serine t threonine and u unknown the serine threonine and cysteine peptidases utilise the amino acid as a nucleophile and form an acyl intermediate these peptidases can also readily act as transferases in the case of aspartic glutamic and metallopeptidases the nucleophile is an activated water molecule in many instances the structural protein fold that characterises the clan or

81 is an oratorio by dmitri shostakovich composed in the summer of 1949 it was written to celebrate the forestation of the russian steppes following the end of world war ii premiered by the leningrad philharmonic under yevgeny mravinsky on 15 november 1949 the work was well received by the government earning the composer a stalin prize the following year the oratorio is notorious for lines praising joseph stalin as the great gardener although its later performances have normally omitted them the oratorio lasts around 40 minutes and is written in seven movements compared to most of shostakovich s other output especially several of his symphonies it is all too easy to consider the song of the forests a simplistic and overtly accessible official piece without remembering the context of the time in which it was written in 1948 shostakovich along with many other composers was again denounced for formalism in the zhdanov decree simplistic and overtly accessible compositions was exactly what the party demanded shostakovich was not the only one writing safe pieces at this time prokofiev composed his oratorio on guard for peace and myaskovsky wrote his 27th symphony even so soviet attacks on composers were both arbitrary

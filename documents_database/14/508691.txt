this can be achieved through a number of ways with the most common form being crosstalk between proteins of signaling cascades in these signal transduction pathways there are often shared components that can interact with either pathway a more complex instance of crosstalk can be observed with transmembrane crosstalk between the extracellular matrix ecm and the cytoskeleton one example of crosstalk between proteins in a signalling pathway can be seen with cyclic adenosine monophosphate s camp role in regulating cell proliferation by interacting with the mitogen activated protein map kinase pathway camp is a compound synthesized in cells by adenylate cyclase in response to a variety of extracellular signals camp primarily acts as an intracellular second messenger whose major intracellular receptor is the camp dependent protein kinase pka that acts through the phosphorylation of target proteins the signal transduction pathway begins with ligand receptor interactions extracellularly this signal is then transduced through the membrane stimulating adenylyl cyclase on the inner membrane surface to catalyze the conversion of atp to camp erk a participating protein in the mapk signaling pathway can be activated or inhibited by camp camp can inhibit erks in a variety of ways most of which involve the

alphaviruses like all other group iv viruses have a positive sense single stranded rna genome there are thirty alphaviruses able to infect various vertebrates such as humans rodents fish birds and larger mammals such as horses as well as invertebrates transmission between species and individuals occurs mainly via mosquitoes making the alphaviruses a member of the collection of arboviruses or arthropod borne viruses alphavirus particles are enveloped have a 70 nm diameter tend to be spherical although slightly pleomorphic and have a 40 nm isometric nucleocapsid the alphaviruses are small spherical enveloped viruses with a genome of a single positive sense strand rna the total genome length ranges between 11 000 and 12 000 nucleotides and has a 5 cap and 3 poly a tail the four non structural protein genes are encoded in the 5 two thirds of the genome while the three structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic mrna colinear with the 3 one third of the genome there are two open reading frames orf s in the genome non structural and structural the first is non structural and encodes proteins nsp1 nsp4 necessary for transcription and replication of viral rna the second encodes three structural proteins

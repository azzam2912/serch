the belt is aged between 3 7 and 3 8 billion years the belt contains variably metamorphosed mafic volcanic and sedimentary rocks the occurrence of boninitic geochemical signatures characterized by extreme depletion in trace elements that are not fluid mobile offers evidence that plate tectonic processes in which lithic crust is melted may have been responsible for the creation of the belt another theory posits that the belt formed via a process known as vertical plate tectonics in 2016 melting snow revealed putative 3 7 billion year old stromatolite fossils which would be the oldest by several hundred million years thus far discovered on earth if confirmed the discovery of complex stromatolite structures at isua so early in the history of the earth would suggest that life first evolved on earth over 4 billion years ago there is currently debate over whether the specimens are indeed biogenic which has been disputed by another research team that visited the site the isua greenstone belt also known as the isua supracrustal belt since it is composed of supracrustal rock deposited upon basement rock strata is located in the southwestern portion of greenland in the isukasia terrane near the nuuk capital region the

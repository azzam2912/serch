their name is derived from the six carbon aromatic phenyl group and the three carbon propene tail of coumaric acid which is the central intermediate in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis from 4 coumaroyl coa emanates the biosynthesis of myriad natural products including lignols precursors to lignin and lignocellulose flavonoids isoflavonoids coumarins aurones stilbenes catechin and phenylpropanoids the coumaroyl component is produced from cinnamic acid phenylpropanoids are found throughout the plant kingdom where they serve as essential components of a number of structural polymers provide protection from ultraviolet light defend against herbivores and pathogens and mediate plant pollinator interactions as floral pigments and scent compounds phenylalanine is first converted to cinnamic acid by the action of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal some plants mainly monocotyledonous use tyrosine to synthesize p coumaric acid by the action of the bifunctional enzyme phenylalanine tyrosine ammonia lyase ptal a series of enzymatic hydroxylations and methylations leads to coumaric acid caffeic acid ferulic acid 5 hydroxyferulic acid and sinapic acid conversion of these acids to their corresponding esters produces some of the volatile components of herb and flower fragrances which serve many functions such as attracting pollinators ethyl cinnamate is a common example reduction of the carboxylic

the analytical hierarchy of formulas includes formulas in the language of second order arithmetic which can have quantifiers over both the set of natural numbers formula 1 and over functions from formula 1 to formula 1 the analytical hierarchy of sets classifies sets by the formulas that can be used to define them it is the lightface version of the projective hierarchy the notation formula 4 indicates the class of formulas in the language of second order arithmetic with no set quantifiers this language does not contain set parameters the greek letters here are lightface symbols which indicate this choice of language each corresponding boldface symbol denotes the corresponding class of formulas in the extended language with a parameter for each real see projective hierarchy for details a formula in the language of second order arithmetic is defined to be formula 5 if it is logically equivalent to a formula of the form formula 6 where formula 7 is formula 8 a formula is defined to be formula 9 if it is logically equivalent to a formula of the form formula 10 where formula 7 is formula 12 this inductive definition defines the classes formula 13 and formula 14 for

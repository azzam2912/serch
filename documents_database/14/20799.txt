the theory of thermal radiation lays down the theory of quantum mechanics by using physics to relate to molecular atomic and sub atomic levels slovenian physicist josef stefan formulated the constant in 1879 and it was later derived in 1884 by austrian physicist ludwig boltzmann the equation can also be derived from planck s law by integrating over all wavelengths at a given temperature which will represent a small flat black body box the amount of thermal radiation emitted increases rapidly and the principal frequency of the radiation becomes higher with increasing temperatures the stefan boltzmann constant can be used to measure the amount of heat that is emitted by a blackbody which absorbs all of the radiant energy that hits it and will emit all the radiant energy furthermore the stefan boltzmann constant allows for temperature k to be converted to units for intensity w m which is power per unit area the value of the stefan boltzmann constant is given in si units by in cgs units the stefan boltzmann constant is in thermochemistry the stefan boltzmann constant is often expressed in cal cm day k in us customary units the stefan boltzmann constant is the value of

cazzani is a northeast divisional champion north american champion and national offshore powerboat racing champion as a young man serafino became familiar with ferrari and lamborghini eight and twelve cylinder engines as a technician and owner of these vehicles cazzani was very familiar with the scream and power produced by these relatively small displacement motors in 1987 jimmy was surprised when his race boat engine builder instructed him not to rev the engines beyond 5800 rpm to cazzani this made no sense jimmy dissected the engines and decided to change their internal geometry which would change their operational characteristics the engine s internals were replaced with light strong components the change in operating range would require larger camshafts better flowing cylinder heads large volume intake manifolds and higher cfm cubic foot per minute carburetors with the extra work produced by the new engine combination durability could become an issue but cazzani kept the motors on a strict maintenance schedule and introduced lightweight exotic titanium valvetrain components into the equation to ensure durability of these endurance racing motors cazzani became one of the pioneering offshore racers to successfully utilize the high rpm potential of the chevrolet in an offshore racing vessel

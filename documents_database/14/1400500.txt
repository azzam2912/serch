a significantly deeper form argues that the fact that the dual notion of a limit is a colimit allows us to change the eilenberg steenrod axioms for homology to give axioms for cohomology it is named after beno eckmann and peter hilton an example is given by currying which tells us that for any object formula 1 a map formula 2 is the same as a map formula 3 where formula 4 is the exponential object given by all maps from formula 5 to formula 6 in the case of topological spaces if we take formula 5 to be the unit interval this leads to a duality between formula 8 and formula 4 which then gives a duality between the reduced suspension formula 10 which is a quotient of formula 11 and the loop space formula 12 which is a subspace of formula 13 this then leads to the adjoint relation formula 14 which allows the study of spectra which give rise to cohomology theories we can also directly relate fibrations and cofibrations a fibration formula 15 is defined by having the homotopy lifting property represented by the following diagram and a cofibration formula 16 is defined by having the

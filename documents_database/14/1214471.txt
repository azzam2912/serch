more specifically a state variable or variables evolve over time according to a differential equation early analyses reflected military interests considering two actors the pursuer and the evader with diametrically opposed goals more recent analyses have reflected engineering or economic considerations differential games are related closely with optimal control problems in an optimal control problem there is single control formula 1 and a single criterion to be optimized differential game theory generalizes this to two controls formula 2 and two criteria one for each player each player attempts to control the state of the system so as to achieve its goal the system responds to the inputs of all players in the study of competition differential games have been employed since a 1925 article by charles f roos the first to study the formal theory of differential games was rufus isaacs publishing a text book treatment in 1965 one of the first games analyzed was the homicidal chauffeur game games with a random time horizon are a particular case of differential games in such games the terminal time is a random variable with a given probability distribution function therefore the players maximize the mathematical expectancy of the cost function it

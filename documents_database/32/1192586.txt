if a body is not totally rigid as is the case of the earth then in a stable state the largest moment of inertia axis will be aligned with the spin axis with the smaller two moments of inertia axes lying in the plane of the equator if the body is not in this steady state true polar wander will occur the planet or moon will rotate as a rigid body to realign the largest moment of inertia axis with the spin axis see polhode description if the body is near the steady state but with the angular momentum not exactly lined up with the largest moment of inertia axis the pole position will oscillate weather and water movements can also induce small changes these subjects are covered in the article polar motion the mass distribution of the earth is not spherically symmetric and the earth has three different moments of inertia the axis around which the moment of inertia is greatest is closely aligned with the rotation axis the axis going through the geographic north and south poles the other two axes are near the equator this is similar to a brick rotating around an axis going through its

some agencies such as the washington metropolitan area transit authority use the term cut route to mean the same thing short turns are practical in scheduling when the short turning bus can proceed through its layover at the short turn loop then start a run in the opposite direction all while reducing the number of buses needed to operate all trips along the route as opposed to if all scheduled trips operated to the terminus of full length trips short turns require the availability of a separate loop on the bus or rail line where the vehicle can turn around and lay over on bus routes this could be streets that can accommodate bus traffic on a rail line this means a location where the layover does not interfere with other rail traffic on rail lines short turns are more limited due to the number of crossovers between tracks short turns are used on bus routes and rail lines where there is a lower demand for service along the part of the route not served by the short turning trips this helps in reducing operating costs while more economical these short turns do not necessarily reduce the number of buses

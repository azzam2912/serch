it can be trapped in an inert gas matrix or made as a short lived gas co can be classified as a ketene or an oxocumulene a kind of heterocumulene co has been detected by its microwave spectrum in the dark cold taurus molecular cloud one and also in the protostar elias 18 the route to produce this is speculated to be or the related cs is more abundant in dark molecular clouds even though oxygen is 20 times more common than sulfur the difference is due to the higher rate of formation and that cs is less polar co can be produced by heating meldrum s acid this also produces acetone carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide r l dekock and w waltner were the first to identify co by reacting atomic carbon with carbon monoxide in an argon matrix they observed an infrared absorption line at 2241 cm they produced carbon atoms by heating graphite inside a thin tantalum tube m e jacox photolysed co in an argon matrix to produce co with an ir absorption line at 2244 cm however he did not recognise what was produced by heating diazocyclopentanetrione or a similar acid anhydride 2 4 azo

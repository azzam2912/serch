the elements in the boron group are characterized by having three valence electrons these elements have also been referred to as the triels boron is classified as a typical non metal while the rest with the possible exception of nihonium are considered post transition metals boron occurs sparsely probably because bombardment by the subatomic particles produced from natural radioactivity disrupts its nuclei aluminium occurs widely on earth and indeed is the third most abundant element in the earth s crust 8 3 gallium is found in the earth with an abundance of 13 ppm indium is the 61st most abundant element in the earth s crust and thallium is found in moderate amounts throughout the planet nihonium is never found in nature and therefore is termed a synthetic element several group 13 elements have biological roles in the ecosystem boron is a trace element in humans and is essential for some plants lack of boron can lead to stunted plant growth while an excess can also cause harm by inhibiting growth aluminium has neither a biological role nor significant toxicity and is considered safe indium and gallium can stimulate metabolism gallium is credited with the ability to bind itself to

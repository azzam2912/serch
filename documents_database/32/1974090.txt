the defining features of paraptosis are cytoplasmic vacuolation independent of caspase activation and inhibition and lack of apoptotic morphology paraptosis lacks several of the hallmark characteristics of apoptosis such as membrane blebbing chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation like apoptosis and other types of programmed cell death the cell is involved in causing its own death and gene expression is required this is in contrast to necrosis which is non programmed cell death that results from injury to the cell paraptosis has been found in some developmental and neurodegenerative cell deaths as well as induced by several cancer drugs the first reported use of the term paraptosis was by sabina sperandio et al in 2000 the group used human insulin like growth factor 1 receptor igf 1r to stimulate cell death in 293t cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts observing distinct differences from other forms of cell death they coined the term paraptosis derived from the greek preposition para meaning beside or related to and apoptosis while sperandio was the first to publish the term paraptosis this was not the first time cell death with the properties of paraptosis was observed terms such as cytoplasmic and type 3 cell death had previously

in man where there is no or almost no adhaesio interthalamica this is reduced to a thin layer medial to the medial nucleus this lamina has no clear subdivisions and the formation may be seen as one entity contrarily to the isothalamus it stains for numerous mediators its connections are not really known participating in periventricular systems this does not include the central region centre median see below along with the paramedian formation it makes a kind of capsule around the medial nucleus circular nucleus together they are deeply regressive structures in evolution only its anterior part is clearly present in humans caudally dorsal to the central region it breaks into small islands some of them are just posterior to the central complex in the part dorsal to the complex the aspect is deeply different from what is seen in macaques where intralaminar elements receive particular afferents such as cerebellar and tectal the tectal afferents observed in macaques for instance have probably moved to the lateral region in humans in vimm and va in any case the connections demonstrated in macaques cannot be assessed simply the regression of intralaminar elements is to be contrasted with the huge increase of the

these bacteria are extracellular and made up of non motile and non sporing cocci it is clinically important for humans it is an infrequent but usually pathogenic part of the skin microbiota it is the predominant species harboring the lancefield group a antigen and is often called group a streptococcus gas however both streptococcus dysgalactiae and the streptococcus anginosus group can possess group a antigen group a streptococci when grown on blood agar typically produces small zones of beta hemolysis a complete destruction of red blood cells a zone size of 2 3 mm is typical it is thus also called group a beta hemolytic streptococcus gabhs and it can make colonies greater than 5 mm in size like other cocci streptococci are round bacteria the species name is derived from greek words meaning a chain of berries latinized from and pus forming genes because streptococcal cells tend to link in chains of round cells see image and a number of infections caused by the bacterium produce pus the main criterion for differentiation between staphylococcus spp and streptococcus spp is the catalase test staphylococci are catalase positive whereas streptococci are catalase negative s pyogenes can be cultured on fresh blood

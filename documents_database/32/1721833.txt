nceh hydrolyzes 2 acetyl monoalkylglycerol ether as part of an enzymatic pathway regulating the levels of platelet activating factor and lysophospholipids that may be involved in cancer development the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by nceh is monoalkylglycerol ethers mages can then be converted to lysophospholipids alkyl lysophosphatidic acid alkyl lpa and alkyl lysophosphatidylcholine alkyl lpc controversial studies by one group also implicate the protein in the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters however loss of the protein in mice selectively reduces 2 acetyl monoalkylglycerol ether activity throughout the body evidence suggests a role for nceh in cancer cancer cell lines contain unusually high levels of the protein reduction of the amount of nceh1 in cancer cells reduces tumor migration and growth in mice and addition of alkyl lpa restores these processes nceh can break down organophosphates like the pesticide metabolite chlorpyrifos oxon conversely enzymatic activity can be inhibited by organophosphates nceh is a serine hydrolase that contains an n terminal transmembrane domain a central catalytic domain and a lipid binding domain at its c terminus the protein exists in three isoforms that result from differences in mrna splicing transcripts encode a protein for isoform a of 448 b of 440 and c of

the term is still in use today to describe a component that extracts a particular signal from all of the electromagnetic waves present detection is usually based on the frequency of the carrier signal as in the familiar frequencies of radio broadcasting but it may also involve filtering a faint signal from noise as in radio astronomy or reconstructing a hidden signal as in steganography in optoelectronics detection means converting a received optical input to an electrical output for example the light signal received through an optical fiber is converted to an electrical signal in a detector such as a photodiode in steganography attempts to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier material is referred to as steganalysis steganalysis has an interesting difference from most other types of detection in that it can often only determine the probability that a hidden message exists this is in contrast to the detection of signals which are simply encrypted as the ciphertext can often be identified with certainty even if it cannot be decoded in the military detection refers to the special discipline of reconnaissance with the aim to recognize the presence of an object in a location or ambiance finally the art of

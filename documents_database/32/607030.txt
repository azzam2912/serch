tpo is used extensively in the automotive industry thermoplastics may include polypropylene pp polyethylene pe block copolymer polypropylene bcpp and others common fillers include though are not restricted to talc fiberglass carbon fiber wollastonite and mos metal oxy sulfate common elastomers include ethylene propylene rubber epr epdm ep diene rubber ethylene octene eo ethylbenzene eb and styrene ethylene butadiene styrene sebs currently there are a great variety of commercially available rubbers and bcpp s they are produced using regioselective and stereoselective catalysts known as metallocenes the metallocene catalyst becomes embedded in the polymer and cannot be recovered components for tpo are blended together at 210 270 c under high shear a twin screw extruder or a continuous mixer may be employed to achieve a continuous stream or a banbury compounder may be employed for batch production a higher degree of mixing and dispersion is achieved in the batch process but the superheat batch must immediately be processed through an extruder to be pelletized into a transportable intermediate thus batch production essentially adds an additional cost step the geometry of the metallocene catalyst will determine the sequence of chirality in the chain as in atactic syndiotactic isotactic as well as average

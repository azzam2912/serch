it is used to share information about other directly connected cisco equipment such as the operating system version and ip address cdp can also be used for on demand routing which is a method of including routing information in cdp announcements so that dynamic routing protocols do not need to be used in simple networks cisco devices send cdp announcements to the destination mac address 01 00 0c cc cc cc out each connected network interface these multicast frames may be received by cisco switches and other networking devices that support cdp into their connected network interface this multicast destination is also used in other cisco protocols such as virtual local area network vlan trunking protocol vtp by default cdp announcements are sent every 60 seconds on interfaces that support subnetwork access protocol snap headers including ethernet frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode atm each cisco device that supports cdp stores the information received from other devices in a table that can be viewed using the show cdp neighbors command this table is also accessible via simple network management protocol snmp the cdp table information is refreshed each time an announcement is received and the holdtime for that entry is

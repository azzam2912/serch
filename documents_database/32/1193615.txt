sh3 binding glutamic acid rich sh3bgr gene is located to human chromosome 21 two homologous genes sh3bgrl and sh3bgrl3 are located to chromosome xq13 3 and 1p34 3 35 respectively and code for small proteins similar to the n terminal region of the sh3bgr protein sh3bgrl3 protein shows a significant similarity to glutaredoxin 1 of e coli and all the three proteins are predicted to belong to thioredoxin like protein family glutaredoxins grxs are ubiquitous oxidoreductases which catalyze the reduction of many intra cellular protein disulfides and play an important role in many redox pathways however the sh3bgrl3 protein lacks the enzymatic function of glutaredoxins and may have a role as a regulator of redox activity proteins such as glutaredoxin and thioredoxin are reported as up regulated in many cancers such as lung and pancreatic they have been implicated in increased resistance of cancer cells to free radicals there is little current evidence which directly links sh3grpl3 with survival in cancer cells however the protein has recently been identified as up regulated in glioblastoma multiforme compared to normal cerebral tissue on proteomic analysis studies of acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line nb4 have also reported up regulation of the protein conversely

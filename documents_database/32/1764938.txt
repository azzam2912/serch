there is a special re labelling operation that re labels the objects in the slots assigning labels from 1 to k where k is the total number of nodes i e the sum of the number of nodes of the individual objects the egf formula 1 of the number of different configurations under this re labelling process is given by in particular if g is the symmetric group of order n hence g n the functions f n z can be further combined into a single generating function which is exponential w r t the variable z and ordinary w r t the variable t we assume that an object formula 4 of size formula 5 represented by formula 6 contains formula 7 labelled internal nodes with the labels going from 1 to m the action of g on the slots is greatly simplified compared to the unlabelled case because the labels distinguish the objects in the slots and the orbits under g all have the same size formula 8 the egf g z may not include objects of size zero this is because they are not distinguished by labels and therefore the presence of two or more of such

the 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16 bit extension of intel s 8 bit 8080 microprocessor with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16 bit address the term x86 came into being because the names of several successors to intel s 8086 processor end in 86 including the 80186 80286 80386 and 80486 processors many additions and extensions have been added to the x86 instruction set over the years almost consistently with full backward compatibility the architecture has been implemented in processors from intel cyrix amd via technologies and many other companies there are also open implementations such as the zet soc platform currently inactive nevertheless of those only intel amd via technologies and dm p electronics hold x86 architectural licenses and from these only the 1st two are actively producing modern 64 bit designs the term is not synonymous with ibm pc compatibility as this implies a multitude of other computer hardware embedded systems as well as general purpose computers used x86 chips before the pc compatible market started some of them before the ibm pc 1981 itself as of 2018 the majority of personal computers

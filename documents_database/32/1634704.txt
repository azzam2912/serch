kinetheodolite is a photographic instrument for collection of trajectory data it can be used to acquire data in the testing of missiles rockets projectiles aircraft and fire control systems in the ripple firing of rockets graze action tests air burst fuze tests and similar operations cinetheodolites provide angular measurements of the line of sight to the vehicle this permits acquiring accurate position data together with timing systems velocity and acceleration data can be developed from the position measurements cinetheodolites can serve as primary sources of position and velocity data to about 30 km slant range these instruments were developed from a family of optical devices known as theodolites by the addition of a movie camera thus adding the ability to track the vehicle in flight and to obtain continuous trajectory data one of the objectives of testing missile and rocket systems is to determine the actual in flight performance of the vehicles themselves one of the prime requirements for establishing the performance of vehicles in flight is to obtain accurate data which will reveal the position in space and the attitude of the vehicle during its trajectory the employment of optics at a missile range may become highly significant in

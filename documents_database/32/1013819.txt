the poly a tail is located on the 3 end of mrna and is 200 250 nucleotides long the binding protein is also involved in mrna precursors by helping polyadenylate polymerase add the poly a nucleotide tail to the pre mrna before translation the nuclear isoform selectively binds to around 50 nucleotides and stimulates the activity of polyadenylate polymerase by increasing its affinity towards rna poly a binding protein is also present during stages of mrna metabolism including nonsense mediated decay and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking the poly a binding protein may also protect the tail from degradation and regulate mrna production without these two proteins in tandem then the poly a tail would not be added and the rna would degrade quickly cytosolic poly a binding protein pabpc is made up of four rna recognition motifs rrms and a c terminal region known as the pabc domain rrm is the most common motifs for rna recognition and is usually made up of 90 100 amino acids previous solution nmr and x ray crystallography studies have shown that rrms are globular domains each composed of 4 anti parallel sheets that are backed by 2 helices the central two strands connected by a

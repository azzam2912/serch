there is currently only one species in this genus the type species his 1 virus though his 2 virus as yet unlisted by ictv is often discussed even grouped alongside his1v the genus name is derived from salt terminal protein virus as their linear dsdna genomes have proteins attached to the 5 termini i e terminal proteins this virus morphotype is commonly observed in hypersaline waters around the world and salterproviruses may represent an environmentally common halovirus the capsid is similar in shape to that of viruses infecting thermophilic archaea the fuselloviridae and his1v was originally described as a probable member of that group however it was later found that there is no genetic relationship and their replication strategies are entirely different and so they were reclassified into a new group salterprovirus viruses in salterprovirus are enveloped with lemon shaped geometries genomes are linear around 145kb in length the genome has 35 open reading frames viral replication is cytoplasmic entry into the host cell is achieved by virus attaches to host cell dna templated transcription is the method of transcription archaea and haloarcula hispanica serve as the natural host transmission routes are passive diffusion the genomes of his1 and his2

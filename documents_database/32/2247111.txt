developed in 2011 and released in 2012 by bosch can fd was originally created in response to the requests of automakers for more accurate real time data just like with classic can this protocol is designed to record and transmit data including errors between devices and microcontrollers without the use of a central host computer can fd is primarily designed to meet the needs of automakers however the pervasiveness of classic can indicates the inclusion of this improved protocol across a variety of applications including defense industrial automation autonomous devices underwater vehicles and medical equipment can fd was created to accommodate increases in bandwidth requirements within automotive networks the can fd protocol has brought the software closer to real time through the minimization of delays between an instruction and transfer of data latency and higher bandwidth can fd also allows for more storage capacity in the can frame while classic can has the capacity to hold 8 bytes of data within the can frame can fd can hold up to 64 this is accomplished through a decrease in relative overhead and improvements to software simplicity and efficiency when transmitting large data objects the can fd busload that was developed by

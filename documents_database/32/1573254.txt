in physical applications that parameter is frequently time t the rate of change of one dimensional integrals with sufficiently smooth integrands is governed by this extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus the calculus of moving surfaces provides analogous formulas for volume integrals over euclidean domains and surface integrals over differential geometry of surfaces curved surfaces including integrals over curved surfaces with moving contour boundaries let t be a time like parameter and consider a time dependent domain with a smooth surface boundary s let f be a time dependent invariant field defined in the interior of then the rate of change of the integral formula 2 is governed by the following law where c is the velocity of the interface the velocity of the interface c is the fundamental concept in the calculus of moving surfaces in the above equation c must be expressed with respect to the exterior normal this law can be considered as the generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus a related law governs the rate of change of the surface integral the law reads where the formula 6 derivative is the fundamental operator in the calculus of moving surfaces originally proposed by jacques hadamard

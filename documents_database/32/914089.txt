the vessels are sorted by ship length including bowsprit if known finding the world s longest wooden ship is not straightforward since there are several contenders depending on which definitions are used for example some of these ships benefited from substantial iron or even steel components since the flexing of wood members can lead to significant leaking as the wood members become longer some of these ships were not very seaworthy and a few sank either immediately after launch or soon thereafter some of the more recent large ships were never able or intended to leave their berths and function as floating museums finally not all of the claims to the title of the world s longest wooden ship are credible or verifiable a further problem is that especially wooden ships have more than one length the most used measure in length for registering a ship is the length of the topmost deck the length on deck lod measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level or the length between perpendiculars lpp lbp measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline cwl in

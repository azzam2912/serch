in humans the oxytocin receptor is encoded by the oxtr gene which has been localized to human chromosome 3p25 the oxtr protein belongs to the g protein coupled receptor family specifically g and acts as a receptor for oxytocin its activity is mediated by g proteins that activate several different second messenger systems oxytocin receptors are expressed by the myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland and in both the myometrium and endometrium of the uterus at the end of pregnancy the oxytocin oxytocin receptor system plays an important role as an inducer of uterine contractions during parturition and of milk ejection oxytocin receptors are also present in the central nervous system these receptors modulate a variety of behaviors including stress and anxiety social memory and recognition sexual and aggressive behaviors bonding affiliation and maternal behavior see the oxytocin article for more details in some mammals oxytocin receptors are also found in the kidney and heart the oxytocinergic circuit projecting from the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus pvn innervates the ventral tegmental area vta dopaminergic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens i e the mesolimbic pathway activation of the pvn vta projection by oxytocin affects sexual social and addictive behavior via this

it was invented by english computer scientist allan plaskett in the mid 1990s the snickometer was introduced by channel 4 in the uk who also introduced the hawk eye and the red zone in 1999 the snickometer is often used in a slow motion television replay by the third umpire to determine if the cricket ball touched the cricket bat on the way through to the wicketkeeper the commentators will listen and view the shape of the recorded soundwave if there is a sound of leather on willow which is usually a short sharp sound in synchrony with the ball passing the bat then the ball has touched the bat other sounds such as the ball hitting the batsman s pads or the bat hitting the pitch biscuit and so on tend to have a fatter shape on the sound waveform if in the umpire s opinion this is the case and the ball was a legal delivery that was caught before touching the ground then the batsman is given out by the umpire the umpire does not have the benefit of the snickometer and must instead rely on his senses of sight and hearing as well as his judgement

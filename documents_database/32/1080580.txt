it is not possible to draw points and lines having this pattern of incidences in the euclidean plane but it is possible in the complex projective plane asked whether there exists a pair of polygons with p sides each having the property that the vertices of one polygon lie on the lines through the edges of the other polygon and vice versa if so the vertices and edges of these polygons would form a projective configuration for formula 1 there is no solution in the euclidean plane but found pairs of polygons of this type for a generalization of the problem in which the points and edges belong to the complex projective plane that is in kantor s solution the coordinates of the polygon vertices are complex numbers kantor s solution for formula 1 a pair of mutually inscribed quadrilaterals in the complex projective plane is called the m bius kantor configuration where denotes the complex cube root of 1 these are the vertices of the complex polygon 3 3 3 with the 8 vertices and 8 3 edges coxeter named it a m bius kantor polygon more abstractly the m bius kantor configuration can be described as a system

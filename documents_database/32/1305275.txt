though slingsby did not enter the competition it spurred them to look in the early 1950s at a two seat version of their type 34 sky the advent of the naca laminar flow aerofoil sections at that time prompted them to start from scratch designing a large aircraft with nearly 18 m span three part wings and a large fuselage with spacious comfortable cockpits the fuselage is built up as a wooden truss with a plywood covered stressed skin top decking and wooden semi monocoque forward fuselage the cockpits are covered by two canopies the forward one hinging to starboard and the rear hinged at the rear forming part of the leading edge in the cut outs provided for access to the rear seat the wings are built up from wood with plywood covering back to the rear spar inboard of the ailerons and forward of the mainspar outboard a rectangular constant thickness chord ratio centre section sits atop the fuselage out to approximately 1 5 span each side where the tapering outer wings are fitted with the leading edge unswept large effective plate type airbrakes are fitted aft of the mainspar to the wings at approximately 1 3 span

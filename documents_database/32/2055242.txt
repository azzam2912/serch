current is then passed between the two edges of the steel to heat the steel to a point at which the edges are forced together to form a bond without the use of welding filler material initially this manufacturing process used low frequency a c current to heat the edges this low frequency process was used from the 1920s until 1970 in 1970 the low frequency process was superseded by a high frequency erw process which produced a higher quality weld over time the welds of low frequency erw pipe was found to be susceptible to selective seam corrosion hook cracks and inadequate bonding of the seams so low frequency erw is no longer used to manufacture pipe the high frequency process is still being used to manufacture pipe for use in new pipeline construction the poplar pipeline was built in the 1950s using pipe made with low frequency electric resistance welds as was the pegasus pipeline on january 19 2015 oil from a broken pipeline seeped into the yellowstone river and contaminated the water supply 10 miles south of glendive montana the release was from bridger pipeline llc s 12 inch poplar line which can carry 42 000 barrels

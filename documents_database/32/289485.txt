the single strand acts as a template for risc to recognize complementary messenger rna mrna transcript once found one of the proteins in risc called argonaute activates and cleaves the mrna this process is called rna interference rnai and it is found in many eukaryotes it is a key process in gene silencing and defense against viral infections the biochemical identification of risc was conducted by gregory hannon and his colleagues at the cold spring harbor laboratory this was only a couple of years after the discovery of rna interference in 1998 by andrew fire and craig mello who shared the 2006 nobel prize in physiology or medicine hannon and his colleagues attempted to identify the rnai mechanisms involved in gene silencing by dsrnas in drosophila cells drosophila s2 cells were transfected with a lacz expression vector to quantify gene expression with galactosidase activity their results showed co transfection with lacz dsrna significantly reduced galactosidase activity compared to control dsrna therefore dsrnas control gene expression via sequence complementarity s2 cells were then transfected with drosophila cyclin e dsrna cycline e is an essential gene for cell cycle progression into the s phase cyclin e dsrna arrested the cell cycle at

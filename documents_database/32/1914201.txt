the film features thaman kumar and arundhati in the lead roles while vincent asokan plays a supporting role it was released on 23 january 2015 and received mainly negative reviews from the critics the film was a below average grosser at the box office the new indian express called it a promising effort by a debutant and worth a watch sify wrote cable sankar s plot is ambitious and it is unique compared to some of the recent commercial films but falls flat the problem here is that cable sankar has done his paper work with perfection but he missed a lot of things in screen transition the times of india gave 2 out of 5 and wrote the film fails to make good on its promise despite the interesting set up mainly because of a tired overlong romantic track with too many songs and dull conversations that just sap the energy out of it some of the scenes have a serial like quality there is an unsuccessful attempt at humour and the film takes a lot of time to get to the plot

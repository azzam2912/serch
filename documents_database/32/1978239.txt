the earliest studies of marine biology trace back to the phoenicians and the greeks who are known as the initial explorers of the oceans and their composition the first recorded observations on the distribution and habits of marine life were made by aristotle 384 322 bc observations made in the earliest studies of marine biology provided an impetus for the age of discovery and exploration that followed during this time a vast amount of knowledge was gained about life that exists in the oceans individuals who contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge include captain james cook 1728 1779 charles darwin 1809 1882 and wyville thomson 1830 1882 these individuals took part in some of the more well known expeditions of all time making foundation contributions to marine biology the era was important for the history of marine biology but naturalists were still constrained by available technologies that limited their ability to effectively locate and accurately examine species that inhabited the deep parts of the ocean the subsequent creation of marine laboratories was another important development because marine scientists now had places to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions technological advances such as sound ranging scuba diving gear

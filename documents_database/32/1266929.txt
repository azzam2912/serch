it is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore however mutants resistant to heat but lacking dipicolinic acid have been isolated suggesting other mechanisms contributing to heat resistance are at work dipicolinic acid forms a complex with calcium ions within the endospore core this complex binds free water molecules causing dehydration of the spore as a result the heat resistance of macromolecules within the core increases the calcium dipicolinic acid complex also functions to protect dna from heat denaturation by inserting itself between the nucleobases thereby increasing the stability of dna two genera of bacterial pathogens are known to produce endospores the aerobic bacillus and anaerobic clostridium the high concentration of dpa in and specificity to bacterial endospores has long made it a prime target in analytical methods for the detection and measurement of bacterial endospores a particularly important development in this area was the demonstration by rosen et al of an assay for dpa based on photoluminescence in the presence of terbium although this phenomenon was first investigated for using dpa in an assay for terbium by barela and sherry extensive subsequent work by numerous scientists has elaborated on and further developed this approach it is

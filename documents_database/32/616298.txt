it has volume approximately equal to 0 942707 and showed that it has the smallest volume of any closed orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold the manifold was independently discovered by as well as since the weeks manifold is an arithmetic hyperbolic 3 manifold its volume can be computed using its arithmetic data and a formula due to armand borel where formula 2 is the number field generated by formula 3 satisfying formula 4 and formula 5 is the dedekind zeta function of formula 2 alternatively where formula 8 is the polylogarithm and formula 9 is the absolute value of the complex root formula 3 with positive imaginary part of the cubic the cusped hyperbolic 3 manifold obtained by 5 1 dehn surgery on the whitehead link is the so called sibling manifold or sister of the figure eight knot complement the figure eight knot s complement and its sibling have the smallest volume of any orientable cusped hyperbolic 3 manifold thus the weeks manifold can be obtained by hyperbolic dehn surgery on one of the two smallest orientable cusped hyperbolic 3 manifolds

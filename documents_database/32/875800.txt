it is named for the mathematician hermann minkowski let d be the discriminant of the field n be the degree of k over formula 1 and formula 2 be the number of complex embeddings where formula 3 is the number of real embeddings then every class in the ideal class group of k contains an integral ideal of norm not exceeding minkowski s bound minkowski s constant for the field k is this bound m since the number of integral ideals of given norm is finite the finiteness of the class number is an immediate consequence and further the ideal class group is generated by the prime ideals of norm at most m minkowski s bound may be used to derive a lower bound for the discriminant of a field k given n r and r since an integral ideal has norm at least one we have 1 m so that for n at least 2 it is easy to show that the lower bound is greater than 1 so we obtain minkowski s theorem that the discriminant of every number field other than q is non trivial this implies that the field of rational numbers has no unramified extension

however this should only be done as a last option when a critical driver is corrupted and is impossible to recover this design parallels that in openvms the unix kernel panic concept is very similar when a bug check is issued a crash dump file will be created if the system is configured to create them this file contains a snapshot of useful low level information about the system that can be used to debug the root cause of the problem and possibly other things in the background if the user has enabled it the system will also write an entry to the system event log the log entry contains information about the bug check including the bug check code and its parameters as well as a link which will report the bug and provide the user with prescriptive suggestions if the cause of the check is definitive and well known next if a kernel debugger is connected and active when the bug check occurs the system will break into the debugger where the cause of the crash can be investigated if no debugger is attached then a blue text screen is displayed that contains information about why the error

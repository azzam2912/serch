the sih molecule is a radical and can be made experimentally by striking an electric arc to silicon on a low pressure hydrogen gas as a surface layer silicon hydrides form when the silicon is cleaned with hydrofluoric acid this surface hydrogen sih decomposes when heated to 750 k other ways to coat a silicon surface in hydrogen is via reaction aith atomic hydrogen or hot silane a 111 crystal face will become covered in the pure monohydride but other faces on a silicon crystal will also have the dihydride and trihydride groups the silylidene group not to be confused with silylidene is a sih group that is bonded with a triple bond the hydrogen can be substituted by other groups to make a more generic family of silylidynes it is known as a ligand on molybdenum silicon monohydride in space was first noticed in sun spots in 1933 later on it was found on the solar disk photosphere and in cool stars mira variable stars of type m or s may have emission lines of sih in even cooler brown dwarfs and planets sih is not found but instead silicon takes form as silicon monoxide at low pressures and

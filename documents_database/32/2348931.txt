the formation consists of conglomerates sandstones and siltstones the barzalosa formation probably dates to the late paleogene to early neogene period oligocene to early miocene epochs and has an approximate thickness of fossils of balanerodus logimus lophiodolodus chaparralensis xenastrapotherium chaparralensis protheosodon sp and proadinotherium sp have been uncovered from the formation in chaparral tolima the formation was defined by scheibe in 1934 and named after barzalosa a vereda of girardot cundinamarca c ceres and etayo elevated the pisos de barzalosa to a formation in 1969 the barzalosa formation consists of conglomerates sandstones and siltstones in parts the formation contains shale beds and gypsum the approximately thick barzalosa formation overlies the olini group and the seca formation in the west and is overlain by the honda group in the east towards fusagasug the formation overlies the la tabla formation and is overlain by the carmen de apical conglomerate as the formation does not contain foraminifera the age is difficult to establish but has been estimated to be oligocene to early miocene or middle eocene to oligocene the depositional environment has been interpreted as alluvial fans and braided rivers the barzalosa formation is apart from its type locality found in tocaima and

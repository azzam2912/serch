it is a separate sump connected to the main show tank it is a refugium in the sense that it permits organisms to be maintained that would not survive in the main system whether food animals anaerobic denitrifying bacteria or photosynthesizers for some applications water flow is limited in order to protect plants or animals that require slow flow the refugium light cycle can be operated opposite to the main tank in order to keep total system ph more stable due to the uptake of acid forming co by photosynthesis occurring in the refugium during its daylight hours one volume guideline for a refugium is 1 10 main tank volume a refugium may be used for one or more purposes such as denitrification nutrient export plankton production circulation surface agitation to improve oxygen exchange with the atmosphere or even aesthetic purposes tropical marine refugiums often contain live rock and live sand macroalgae and sometimes scavenger microfauna such as micro brittle stars tiny sea stars such as asterina snails and worms to achieve maximum biological filtration through uptake of nutrients by macroalgae mangroves strong lighting is often utilized in the refugium in this fashion macroalgae algae growth is encouraged competing with

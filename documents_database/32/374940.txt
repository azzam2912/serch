in the case of ionic crystals the fluxes of the diffusing species are coupled while in a plasma the various species diffuse at the same rate in plasma physics ambipolar diffusion is closely related to the concept of quasineutrality in most plasmas the forces acting on the ions are different from those acting on the electrons so naively one would expect one species to be transported faster than the other whether by diffusion or convection or some other process if such differential transport has a divergence then it results in a change of the charge density the latter will in turn create an electric field that can alter the transport of one or both species in such a way that they become equal the simplest example is a plasma localized in an unmagnetized vacuum see inertial confinement fusion both electrons and ions will stream outward with their respective thermal velocity if the ions are relatively cold their thermal velocity will be small the thermal velocity of the electrons will be fast due to their high temperature and low mass formula 1 as the electrons leave the initial volume they will leave behind a positive charge density of ions which will

cancerous cells usually cannot be recognized by human immune system so cancer would happen when the immune system fail to destroy the cancerous cells some researchers state that cancer can be treated by increasing the response of t cells especially cd4 t cells to cancerous cells through cancer vaccine injection cd4 t cells promote antitumor immunity by numerous mechanisms including enhancing antigen presentation co stimulation t cell homing t cell activation and effector function these effects are mediated at sites of t cell priming and at the tumor microenvironment several cancer vaccine approaches induce durable cd4 t cell responses and have promising clinical activity this kind of vaccine can be realized by dna recombinant fusion protein expressed in e coli the protein named mage 3 has already been used in lung cancer treatment and received very good feedback recent studies show the crucial role of proliferating activated effector memory th1 cd4 t cells in effective antitumor immunity and reveal that cd4 t cells induce more durable immune mediated tumor control than cd8 t cells given that cd4 t cells are known to play such a central role in regulating virtually all antigen specific immune responses they are still not paid

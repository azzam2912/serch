in a power transmission network without complete disconnection the term includes superconducting solid state and inductive devices electric power distribution systems include circuit breakers to disconnect power in case of a fault but to maximize reliability they wish to disconnect the smallest possible portion of the network this means that even the smallest circuit breakers as well as all wiring to them must be able to disconnect large fault currents a problem arises if the electricity supply is upgraded by adding new generation capacity or by adding cross connections because these increase the amount of power that can be supplied all of the branch circuits must have their bus bars and circuit breakers upgraded to handle the new higher fault current limit this poses a particular problem when distributed generation such as wind farms and rooftop solar power is added to an existing electric grid it is desirable to be able to add additional power sources without large system wide upgrades a simple solution is to add electrical impedance to the circuit this limits the rate at which current can increase which limits the level the fault current can rise to before the breaker is opened however this also limits

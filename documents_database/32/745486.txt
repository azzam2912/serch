it consists of lipid and hydrocarbon polymers impregnated with wax and is synthesized exclusively by the epidermal cells the plant cuticle is a layer of lipid polymers impregnated with waxes that is present on the outer surfaces of the primary organs of all vascular land plants it is also present in the sporophyte generation of hornworts and in both sporophyte and gametophyte generations of mosses the plant cuticle forms a coherent outer covering of the plant that can be isolated intact by treating plant tissue with enzymes such as pectinase and cellulase the cuticle is composed of an insoluble cuticular membrane impregnated by and covered with soluble waxes cutin a polyester polymer composed of inter esterified omega hydroxy acids which are cross linked by ester and epoxide bonds is the best known structural component of the cuticular membrane the cuticle can also contain a non saponifiable hydrocarbon polymer known as cutan the cuticular membrane is impregnated with cuticular waxes and covered with epicuticular waxes which are mixtures of hydrophobic aliphatic compounds hydrocarbons with chain lengths typically in the range c16 to c36 current scientific understanding of cuticular wax is limited yet considerable chemicals and pathways have been identified cuticular wax

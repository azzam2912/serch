its position is calculated after supporting the aircraft on at least two sets of weighing scales or load cells and noting the weight shown on each set of scales or load cells the center of gravity affects the stability of the aircraft to ensure the aircraft is safe to fly the center of gravity must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer center of gravity cg is calculated as follows the arm that results from this calculation must be within the center of gravity limits dictated by the aircraft manufacturer if it is not weight in the aircraft must be removed added rarely or redistributed until the center of gravity falls within the prescribed limits aircraft center of gravity calculations are only performed along a single axis from the zero point of the reference datum that represents the longitudinal axis of the aircraft to calculate fore to aft balance some helicopter types utilize lateral cg limits as well as longitudinal limits operation of such helicopters requires calculating cg along two axes one calculation for longitudinal cg fore to aft balance and another calculation for lateral cg left to right balance the weight moment and arm values of fixed

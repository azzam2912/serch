while it would be possible to make an articulated locomotive of this arrangement the only 4 4 4 4s ever built were duplex locomotives with two sets of cylinders driving two sets of driven wheels in one rigid frame essentially a 4 8 4 with divided drive the first locomotive built with this arrangement was the baltimore and ohio railroad s sole class n 1 5600 george h emerson constructed at the b o s own mount clare shops in may 1937 to reduce the fixed wheelbase this locomotive had the two sets of cylinders at opposite ends so that the rear pair were beside the firebox this proved to be a poor design as it restricted the firebox size and exposed the cylinders to dust and dirt causing premature wear the locomotive was not considered successful enough to duplicate the sole n 1 was retired in 1943 and scrapped in 1950 the next locomotives to use the 4 4 4 4 arrangement were the pennsylvania railroad s 52 class t1 locomotives these had the cylinders in front of the wheels they drove so that the rear pair were between the two sets of drivers these locomotives were impressive performers

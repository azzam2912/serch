at that time fewer than 100 transistors would fit in an integrated circuit chip the design capability for such circuits was centered in industry with universities struggling to catch up soon the number of transistors which fit in a chip started doubling every two years much more complex circuits could then fit on a single chip but the device physicists who fabricated the chips were not experts in electronic circuit design so their designs were limited more by their expertise and imaginations than by limitations in the technology professor carver mead who popularized the term moore s law for this doubling trend called for a separation of design from technology throughout the 1970s he discovered and taught simple design rules that did not vary in each new generation of semiconductors using these rules circuit designs could be created that would create working chips despite the many variations in the fast evolving semiconductor industry electronic design automation software translated these generic circuit designs to implement them in each semiconductor technology in 1978 79 when approximately 20 000 transistors could be fabricated in a single chip carver mead and lynn conway wrote the textbook introduction to vlsi systems it was published in

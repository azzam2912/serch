it is a special case of a trapezoid alternatively it can be defined as a trapezoid in which both legs and both base angles are of the same measure note that a non rectangular parallelogram is not an isosceles trapezoid because of the second condition or because it has no line of symmetry in any isosceles trapezoid two opposite sides the bases are parallel and the two other sides the legs are of equal length properties shared with the parallelogram the diagonals are also of equal length the base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are equal in measure there are in fact two pairs of equal base angles where one base angle is the supplementary angle of a base angle at the other base rectangles and squares are usually considered to be special cases of isosceles trapezoids though some sources would exclude them another special case is a 3 equal side trapezoid sometimes known as a trilateral trapezoid or a trisosceles trapezoid they can also be seen dissected from regular polygons of 5 sides or more as a truncation of 4 sequential vertices any non self crossing quadrilateral with exactly one axis of symmetry must be either an isosceles trapezoid

sertoli cells function to nourish the developing sperm cells they secrete androgen binding protein a binding protein which increases the concentration of testosterone inside the seminiferous tubules embryologically they also secrete the anti m llerian hormone amh necessary for the female m llerian ducts to regress there are two types convoluted and straight convoluted toward the lateral side and straight as the tubule comes medially to form ducts that will exit the testis the seminiferous tubules are formed from the testis cords that develop from the primitive gonadal cords formed from the gonadal ridge spermatogenesis the process for producing spermatozoa takes place in the seminiferous tubules during spermatogenesis the dna of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules is subject to damage from such sources as reactive oxygen species the genomic integrity of spermatogenic cells is protected by dna repair processes deficiencies in the enzymes employed in these repair processes may lead to infertility

pliny the elder book 3 chapter 24 of naturalis historia published in 77 ce quotes a monument to the reign of augustus the tropeaum alpium located in the rhaetia of his day stating that augustus subdued the alpine peoples from the upper sea to the lower sea including the calucones ptolemy in geography book 2 chapter 10 on the other hand locates the kaloukones on either side of the elbe below north of the silingae or silesians since the elbe does not drain the alps if the two calucones are the same the tropeaum cannot have meant that augustus subdued only rhaetia however the tropeaum also lists the rugusci another rhaetian tribe but some have hypothesized this the tribe he intended to reference was the rugii who at that time would have been located on or near r gen according to this theory pliny s upper and lower seas would have been the baltic and the mediterranean respectively this hypothesis is not likely to be true unless augustus achieved some sort of alliance with germanic tribes stretching over the entire region from the danube to the baltic sea

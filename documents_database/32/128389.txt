in particular the objects in question are mostly functions or maps and subsets in specific implementations of this idea the sets or maps in question will have some property such as being analytic or smooth but in general this is not needed the maps or functions in question need not even be continuous it is however necessary that the space on in which the object is defined is a topological space in order that the word local have some sense the name is derived from cereal germ in a continuation of the sheaf metaphor as a germ is locally the heart of a function as it is for a grain given a point x of a topological space x and two maps formula 1 where y is any set then formula 2 and formula 3 define the same germ at x if there is a neighbourhood u of x such that restricted to u f and g are equal meaning that formula 4 for all u in u similarly if s and t are any two subsets of x then they define the same germ at x if there is again a neighbourhood u of x such that it is

this means that the latent variable explains why the observed items are related to another this can be explained by the following example local independence can be explained by an example of lazarsfeld and henry 1968 suppose that a sample of 1000 people was asked whether they read journals a and b their responses were as follows one can easily see that the two variables reading a and reading b are strongly related and thus dependent on each other readers of a tend to read b more often 52 than non readers of a 28 if reading a and b were independent then the formula p a b p a p b would hold but 260 1000 isn t 400 1000 500 1000 thus reading a and b are statistically dependent on each other if the analysis is extended to also look at the education level of these people the following tables are found again if reading a and b were independent then p a b p a p b would hold separately for each education level and in fact 240 500 300 500 400 500 and 20 500 100 500 100 500 thus if a separation is made between

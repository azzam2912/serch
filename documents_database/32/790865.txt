cuter provides a collection of test problems along with a set of tools to help developers design compare and improve new and existing test problem solvers cuter is the successor of the original constrained and unconstrained testing environment cute of bongartz conn gould and toint it provides support for a larger number of platforms and operating systems as well as a more convenient optimization toolbox the test problems provided in cuter are written in standard input format sif a decoder to convert from this format into well defined subroutines and data files is available as a separate package once translated these files may be manipulated to provide tools suitable for testing optimization packages ready to use interfaces to existing packages such as ipopt minos snopt filtersqp knitro and more are provided the problems in the cute subset are also available in the ampl format more than 1000 problems are available in the collection including problems in over time the cuter test set has become the de facto standard benchmark for research and production level optimization solvers and is used and cited in numerous published research articles the sif is a superset of the original mps format for linear programming and

it is native to western north america in 2005 d pseudoobscura was the second drosophila species to have its genome sequenced after the model organism drosophila melanogaster allopatric speciation has been induced by reproductive isolation in d pseudoobscura after only eight generations using different food types starch and maltose females drosophila pseudoobscura mate through polyandry meaning they mate with more than one male by mating with multiple males polyandrous females have more genetically diverse offspring in the d pseudoobscura population some males have a harmful chromosome called sex ratio sr where an inactive y chromosome is transmitted if an sr male mates with a female the female will produce only daughters monandry allows the spread of sr and increases the extinction risk in species having sr genes because the sr driver can spread quickly enriching populations for females polyandry decreases the sr gene frequency because the non sr male sperm outcompete the sr male sperm therefore polyandry results in a decreased risk of extinction in the population monandrous female d pseudoobscura do not obtain sufficient sperm or a plenty of suitable sperm for the fertilization even though monandrous female experiencing multiple copulations can produce more eggs than polyandrous female experiencing

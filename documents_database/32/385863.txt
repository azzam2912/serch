whether the rock remains weak becomes an important point in determining the potential for bigger earthquakes on a small scale fractured rock behaves essentially the same throughout the world in that the angle of friction is more or less uniform see fault friction a small element of rock in a larger mass responds to stress changes in a well defined manner if it is squeezed by differential stresses greater than its strength it is capable of large deformations a band of weak fractured rock in a competent mass can deform to resemble a classic geologic fault using seismometers and earthquake location the requisite pattern of micro earthquakes can be observed for earthquakes it all starts with an embedded penny shaped crack as first envisioned by brune as illustrated an earthquake zone may start as a single crack growing to form many individual cracks and collections of cracks along a fault the key to fault growth is the concept of a following force as conveniently provided for interplate earthquakes by the motion of tectonic plates under a following force the seismic displacements eventually form a topographic feature such as a mountain range intraplate earthquakes do not have a following force and

his most noteworthy contributions were rocket motors for the messerschmitt me 163 and bachem ba 349 interceptor aircraft so called starthilfe jettisonable rocket propulsion units used for a variety of luftwaffe aircraft during world war ii and a revolutionary new propulsion system for submarines known as air independent propulsion aip walter began training as a machinist in 1917 in hamburg and in 1921 commenced studies in mechanical engineering at the technical university of berlin he left before completing these studies however in order to take up a position at the stettiner maschinenbau ag vulcan a major shipyard walter s experience with marine engines here led him to become interested in overcoming some of the limitations of the internal combustion engine he reasoned that an engine powered by a fuel source already rich with oxygen would not require an external supply of oxygen from the atmosphere or from tanks this would have obvious advantages for powering submarines and torpedoes research suggested that hydrogen peroxide was a suitable monopropellant fuel in the presence of a suitable catalyst it would break down into oxygen and steam at high temperature the heat of the reaction would cause the oxygen and steam to expand and

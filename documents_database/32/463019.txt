an adherens junction is defined as a cell junction whose cytoplasmic face is linked to the actin cytoskeleton they can appear as bands encircling the cell zonula adherens or as spots of attachment to the extracellular matrix adhesion plaques adherens junctions uniquely disassemble in uterine epithelial cells to allow the blastocyst to penetrate between epithelial cells a similar cell junction in non epithelial non endothelial cells is the fascia adherens it is structurally the same but appears in ribbonlike patterns that do not completely encircle the cells one example is in cardiomyocytes adherens junctions are composed of the following proteins adherens junctions were for many years thought to share the characteristic of anchor cells through their cytoplasmic actin filaments the accepted model has been that adherens junctions serve as a bridge connecting the actin cytoskeleton of neighboring cells through direct interaction however scientists have not been able to isolate the quaternary complex of cadherin catenin catenin actin in vitro recent data 2005 demonstrate that membrane associated actin is several fold less stable compared to components of the adherens junctional complex additionally the authors found that monomeric catenin preferentially binds to the cadherin junction complex through catenin dimeric catenin preferentially binds

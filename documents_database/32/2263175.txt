the key assumption of their theory was that the local stress value at a time depends upon the history of the local deformation up to in general in materials with memory the local value of some constitutive quantity stress heat flux electric current polarization and magnetization etc at a time depends upon the history of the state variables deformation temperature electric and magnetic fields etc the hypothesis that the remote history of a variable has less influence than its values in the recent past was stated in modern continuum mechanics as the fading memory principle by bernard coleman and walter noll this assumption was implicit in the pioneer works when restricted to cyclic hystories it traces back to the closed cycle principle stated by volterra which leads to a constitutive relation of integral convolution type in the linear case this relation takes the form of a volterra equation in the linear case this relation takes the form of a volterra equation

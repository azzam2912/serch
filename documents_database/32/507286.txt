although it was predominantly studied for its demonstration of asymmetrical brain development and function in recent years many scientists have begun to examine the habenular nuclei s role in motivation and behavior as it relates to an understanding of the physiology of addiction the habenular nuclei comprise a small group of nuclei that are part of the epithalamus of the diencephalon and is located just above the thalamus and is divided into two asymmetric halves the medial habenula mhb and the lateral habenula lhb these nuclei are hypothesized to be involved in regulation of monamines such as dopamine and serotonin the medial habenula receives connections from posterior septum pellucidum and diagonal band of broca the lateral habenula receives afferents from the lateral hypothalamus nucleus accumbens internal globus pallidus ventral pallidum and diagonal band of broca as a whole this complexly interconnected region is part of the dorsal diencephalic conduction ddc system responsible for relaying information from the limbic system to the midbrain hindbrain and medial forebrain the right and left habenular nuclei are connected to each other by the habenular commissure habenula nuclear divisions the pineal gland is attached to the brain in this region nerve impulses from the habenular

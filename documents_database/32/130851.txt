the elements of g are called the symmetries of x a special case of this is when the group g in question is the automorphism group of the space x here automorphism group can mean isometry group diffeomorphism group or homeomorphism group in this case x is homogeneous if intuitively x looks locally the same at each point either in the sense of isometry rigid geometry diffeomorphism differential geometry or homeomorphism topology some authors insist that the action of g be faithful non identity elements act non trivially although the present article does not thus there is a group action of g on x which can be thought of as preserving some geometric structure on x and making x into a single g orbit let x be a non empty set and g a group then x is called a g space if it is equipped with an action of g on x note that automatically g acts by automorphisms bijections on the set if x in addition belongs to some category then the elements of g are assumed to act as automorphisms in the same category thus the maps on x effected by g are structure preserving a homogeneous

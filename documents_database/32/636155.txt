the technique was developed by walt wright a long time beekeeper from tennessee checkerboarding takes advantage of the bee colony s primary motivation which is survival as survival of the existing colony takes priority over swarm preparation and swarming bees will not prepare for a reproductive swarm if they perceive the survival of the existing colony might be jeopardized it is hypothesized that swarm preparation starts in the late winter the over wintering colony consumes honey and expands the brood volume at this point the bee colony apparently senses that it has enough remaining honey stores and a large enough brood nest to risk swarm preparation the bee colony s first activity of swarm preparation is to reduce the brood volume by creating additional stores inside the brood area as brood emerges selected cells are back filled with honey nectar or pollen later into the season as space for egg laying decreases the queen will not be able to lay as many eggs this forces the queen to diet and lose weight so she becomes fit for the swarm flight apparently at the first time this type of backfilling behavior starts is the best time to do the checkerboarding intervention

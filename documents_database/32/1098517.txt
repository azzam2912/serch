dynamic frequency scaling helps preserve battery on mobile devices and decrease cooling cost and noise on quiet computing settings or can be useful as a security measure for overheated systems e g after poor overclocking dynamic frequency scaling is used in all ranges of computing systems ranging from mobile systems to data centers to reduce the power at the times of low workload the dynamic power switching power dissipated per unit of time by a chip is c v a f where c is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle v is voltage a is the activity factor indicating the average number of switching events undergone by the transistors in the chip as a unit less quantity and f is the switching frequency voltage is therefore the main determinant of power usage and heating the voltage required for stable operation is determined by the frequency at which the circuit is clocked and can be reduced if the frequency is also reduced dynamic power alone does not account for the total power of the chip however as there is also static power which is primarily because of various leakage currents due to static power consumption and asymptotic execution time it

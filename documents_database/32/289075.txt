among them computerized dynamic posturography cdp also called test of balance tob is a non invasive specialized clinical assessment technique used to quantify the central nervous system adaptive mechanisms sensory motor and central involved in the control of posture and balance both in normal such as in physical education and sports training and abnormal conditions particularly in the diagnosis of balance disorders and in physical therapy and postural re education due to the complex interactions among sensory motor and central processes involved in posture and balance cdp requires different protocols in order to differentiate among the many defects and impairments which may affect the patient s posture control system thus cdp challenges it by using several combinations of visual and support surface stimuli and parameters clinical applications for cdp were first described by l m nashner in 1982 and the first commercially available testing system was developed in 1986 when neurocom international inc launched the equitest system static posturography is carried out by placing the patient in a standing posture on a fixed instrumented platform forceplate connected to sensitive detectors force and movement transducers which are able to detect the tiny oscillations of the body dynamic posturography differentiates from static

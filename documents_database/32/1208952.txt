they are built to fire chunks of potato as a hobby or to fire other sorts of projectiles for practical use projectiles or failing guns can be dangerous and result in life threatening injuries including cranial fractures enucleation and blindness if a person is hit the potato cannon can trace its origin to the world war ii era holman projector which was a shipboard anti aircraft weapon all spud guns propel projectiles down their barrels using pressurised gas in the same manner as a firearm although at a much lower pressure there are four basic ways that spud guns may achieve this combustion powered spud guns typically have the least complex designs the four basic elements of which are in order to fire the operator loads a projectile into the barrel adds fuel to the combustion chamber for example aerosols or propane and triggers the ignition source often using a piezoelectric barbecue igniter the fuel then ignites creating hot expanding gases and forcing the projectile out of the barrel distances vary greatly depending on many factors including the type of fuel used the efficiency of the fuel air ratio the combustion chamber barrel ratio and the flight characteristics of the

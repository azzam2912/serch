rosenbrock in 1960 which is used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms it is also known as rosenbrock s valley or rosenbrock s banana function the global minimum is inside a long narrow parabolic shaped flat valley to find the valley is trivial to converge to the global minimum however is difficult the function is defined by formula 1 it has a global minimum at formula 2 where formula 3 usually these parameters are set such that formula 4 and formula 5 only in the trivial case where formula 6 is the function symmetric and the minimum at the origin two variants are commonly encountered one is the sum of formula 7 uncoupled 2d rosenbrock problems and is defined only for even formula 8s this variant has predictably simple solutions a second more involved variant is has exactly one minimum for formula 11 at formula 12 and exactly two minima for formula 13 the global minimum of all ones and a local minimum near formula 14 this result is obtained by setting the gradient of the function equal to zero noticing that the resulting equation is a rational function of formula 15 for small formula 8 the polynomials

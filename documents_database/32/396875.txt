it took reports from multiple sensors on different ships and collated it to produce a single unified map of the battlespace this information could then be relayed back to the ships and to the weapons operators warships have compartments known as combat information centers or cics that collect sort and then communicate all of the battlefield information known to that ship information about targets would be forwarded to the cic by the operators of the radar and sonar systems where crewmen would use this information to update a shared map commanders used the map to direct weapons to particular targets the system was similar to the battle of britain bunker system but on a smaller scale there were two major problems with this system one was that each ship had its own view of the battlespace independent of the rest of the ships in the task force this led to force allocation problems the ship with the right weapon for a particular target might not see that target on their sensors or two ships might attempt to attack the same target while ignoring another this could be addressed by adding inter ship radio or flag signals as another input to

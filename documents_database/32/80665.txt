it relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the adsorbent material causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out of the column hplc has been used for manufacturing e g during the production process of pharmaceutical and biological products legal e g detecting performance enhancement drugs in urine research e g separating the components of a complex biological sample or of similar synthetic chemicals from each other and medical e g detecting vitamin d levels in blood serum purposes chromatography can be described as a mass transfer process involving adsorption hplc relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid and a sample mixture through a column filled with adsorbent leading to the separation of the sample components the active component of the column the adsorbent is typically a granular material made of solid particles e g silica polymers etc 2 50 m in size the components of the sample mixture are separated from each other due to their different degrees of interaction with the

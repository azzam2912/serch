this varied voltage output is used for dimming street lights varying heating temperatures in homes or industry speed control of fans and winding machines and many other applications in a similar fashion to an autotransformer voltage controller modules come under the purview of power electronics because they are low maintenance and very efficient voltage controllers have largely replaced such modules as magnetic amplifiers and saturable reactors in industrial use voltage controllers work in two different ways either through on and off control or through phase control in an on and off controller thyristors are used to switch on the circuits for a few cycles of voltage and off for certain cycles thus altering the total rms voltage value of the output and acting as a high speed ac switch the rapid switching results in high frequency distortion artifacts which can cause a rise in temperature and may lead to interference in nearby electronics such designs are not practical except in low power applications in phase angle control thyristors are used to halve the voltage cycle during input by controlling the phase angle or trigger angle the output rms voltage of the load can be varied the thyristor is turned on

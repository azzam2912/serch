it used two slightly separated antenna elements to send the beam slightly to either side of the midline of the antenna switching between the two to find which one gave the stronger return thereby indicating which direction the antenna should be moved in order to point directly at the target the concept was used only briefly and was almost completely replaced by conical scanning systems by the end of world war ii the concept is also known as sequential lobing although this terminology appears to be rare and the associated output was sometimes known as a split display early radar antennas generally consisted of a number of small dipole antennas in front of a passive reflector the dipoles were placed in order to have them constructively interfere in front of the antenna thereby aiming the signal in that direction the beam s angular spread is a function of the number of elements with more elements producing a more tightly focussed beam a huge number of such elements would be ideal but impractical due to them having to be placed at a specific distance to each other depending on the wavelength of the radio source being used in early longwave systems

the theorem is named after adolf hurwitz let f be a sequence of holomorphic functions on a connected open set g that converge uniformly on compact subsets of g to a holomorphic function f which is not constantly zero on g if f has a zero of order m at z then for every small enough 0 and for sufficiently large k n depending on f has precisely m zeroes in the disk defined by z z multiplicity furthermore these zeroes converge to z as k the theorem does not guarantee that the result will hold for arbitrary disks indeed if one chooses a disk such that f has zeroes on its boundary the theorem fails an explicit example is to consider the unit disk d and the sequence defined by which converges uniformly to f z z 1 the function f z contains no zeroes in d however each f has exactly one zero in the disk corresponding to the real value 1 1 n hurwitz s theorem is used in the proof of the riemann mapping theorem and also has the following two corollaries as an immediate consequence let f be an analytic function on an open subset

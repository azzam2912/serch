people typically spend more overall when one of two things is true when people actually are richer objectively or when people perceive themselves to be richer for example the assessed value of their home increases or a stock they own goes up in price demand for some goods called inferior goods decreases with increasing wealth for example consider consumption of cheap fast food versus steak as someone becomes wealthier their demand for cheap fast food is likely to decrease and their demand for more expensive steak may increase consumption may be tied to relative wealth particularly when supply is highly inelastic or when the seller is a monopoly one s ability to purchase a good may be highly related to one s relative wealth in the economy consider for example the cost of real estate in a city with high average wealth for example new york or london in comparison to a city with a low average wealth supply is fairly inelastic so if a helicopter drop or gold rush were to suddenly create large amounts of wealth in the low wealth city those who did not receive this new wealth would rapidly find themselves crowded out of such markets

web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the world wide web web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development for example many web frameworks provide libraries for database access templating frameworks and session management and they often promote code reuse although they often target development of dynamic web sites they are also applicable to static websites as the design of the world wide web was not inherently dynamic early hypertext consisted of hand coded html that was published on web servers any modifications to published pages needed to be performed by the pages author in 1993 the common gateway interface cgi standard was introduced for interfacing external applications with web servers to provide a dynamic web page that reflected user inputs original implementations of the cgi interface typically had adverse effects on the server load however because each request started a separate process more recent implementations utilize persistent processes amongst other techniques to reduce the footprint in the server s resources and offer a general performance boost in 1995 fully integrated server language development environments first emerged and new web specific languages were introduced such as coldfusion

it is used in robotics by some legged or wheeled robots to estimate their position relative to a starting location this method is sensitive to errors due to the integration of velocity measurements over time to give position estimates rapid and accurate data collection instrument calibration and processing are required in most cases for odometry to be used effectively the word odometry is composed from the greek words odos meaning route and metron meaning measure suppose a robot has rotary encoders on its wheels or on its legged joints it drives forward for some time and then would like to know how far it has traveled it can measure how far the wheels have rotated and if it knows the circumference of its wheels compute the distance train operations are also frequent users of odometrics typically a train gets an absolute position by passing over stationary sensors in the tracks while odometry is used to calculate relative position while the train is between the sensors suppose that a simple robot has two wheels which can both move forward or reverse and that they are positioned parallel to one another and equidistant from the center of the robot further assume that

given a space formula 4 let formula 5 denote the cone of formula 4 then we get a non unique map induced by a homotopy from formula 2 to a trivial map which when post composed with formula 9 gives a map similarly we get a non unique map formula 11 induced by a homotopy from formula 3 to a trivial map which when composed with formula 13 the cone of the map formula 14 gives another map by joining together these two cones on formula 16 and the maps from them to formula 17 we get a map representing an element in the group formula 19 of homotopy classes of maps from the suspension formula 20 to formula 17 called the toda bracket of formula 14 formula 23 and formula 9 the map formula 25 is not uniquely defined up to homotopy because there was some choice in choosing the maps from the cones changing these maps changes the toda bracket by adding elements of formula 26 and formula 27 there are also higher toda brackets of several elements defined when suitable lower toda brackets vanish this parallels the theory of massey products in cohomology the direct sum of

geren and rainer k sachs shows that if in a given universe all freely falling observers measure the cosmic background radiation to have exactly the same properties in all directions that is they measure the background radiation to be isotropic then that universe is an isotropic and homogeneous flrw spacetime if the one uses a kinetic picture and the collision term vanishes i e in the so called vlasov case or if there is a so called detailed balance this result was later extended to the full boltzmann case by r treciokas and g f r ellis using the fact that as measured from earth the cosmic microwave background is indeed highly isotropic the temperature characterizing this thermal radiation varies only by tenth of thousandth of a kelvin with the direction of observations and making the copernican assumption that earth does not occupy a privileged cosmic position this constitutes the strongest available evidence for our own universe s homogeneity and isotropy and hence for the foundation of current standard cosmological models strictly speaking this conclusion has a potential flaw while the ehlers geren sachs theorem concerns only exactly isotropic measurements it is known that the background radiation does have minute

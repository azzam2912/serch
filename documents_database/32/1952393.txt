hence a net can contain further net items being able to move around and fire themselves nets within nets are well suited for the modelling of distributed systems under the particular aspects of in a lot of publications in relation to object oriented design is given in order to combine the ability of petri nets in modelling distributed computing with the modelling of objects being able to be created and to interact starting from the need of practical applications by the mid of nineties different formalisms have been created which fit the description of nets within nets lomazova and schnoebelen are listing some of these approaches namely by sibertin blanc lakos moldt und wienberg as extending coloured petri nets aside the object nets of valk the earliest use of such hierarchic net models appeared by r diger valk in valk and jessen where the so called task flow nets are introduced in order to model task systems in operating systems in these models tasks are modelled by a petri net which represents the precedences of tasks and their state of execution the most important differences in semantics is given by the execution of net tokens on the one side net

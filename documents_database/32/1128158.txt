six 26s proteasome aaa atpase subunits rpt1 this protein rpt2 rpt3 rpt4 rpt5 and rpt6 together with four non atpase subunits rpn1 rpn2 rpn10 and rpn13 form the base sub complex of 19s regulatory particle for proteasome complex the gene psmc2 encodes one of the atpase subunits a member of the triple a family of atpases which have a chaperone like activity this subunit has been shown to interact with several of the basal transcription factors so in addition to participation in proteasome functions this subunit may participate in the regulation of transcription this subunit may also compete with psmc3 for binding to the hiv tat protein to regulate the interaction between the viral protein and the transcription complex the human psmc2 gene has 13 exons and locates at chromosome band 7q22 1 q22 3 the human protein 26s protease regulatory subunit 7 is 48 6kda in size and composed of 433 amino acids the calculated theoretical pi of this protein is 526s protease regulatory subunit 5 71 one expression isoform is generated by alternative splicing in which 1 137 of the amino acid sequence is missing 26s proteasome complex is usually consisted of a 20s core particle cp or

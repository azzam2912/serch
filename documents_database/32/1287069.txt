there is no formal standard and several variations exist but a typical xyz format specifies the molecule geometry by giving the number of atoms with cartesian coordinates that will be read on the first line a comment on the second and the lines of atomic coordinates in the following lines the file format is used in computational chemistry programs for importing and exporting geometries the units are generally in ngstr ms some variations include using atomic numbers instead of atomic symbols or skipping the comment line files using the xyz format conventionally have the codice 1 extension the formatting of the xyz file format is as follows connectivity information in the xyz file format is implied rather than explicit according to the main page for xyz part of xmol note that the xyz format doesn t contain connectivity information this intentional omission allows for greater flexibility to create an xyz file you don t need to know where a molecule s bonds are you just need to know where its atoms are connectivity information is generated automatically for xyz files as they are read into xmol related applications briefly if the distance between two atoms is less than the sum

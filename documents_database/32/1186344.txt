it develops where the water is fairly acidic and has very few plant nutrients poor fen is intermediate between the taller vegetation of fen which occurs where the water is much less acidic and the short mossy vegetation of bog which is even more acidic poor fen occurs where the ground is permanently wet with nutrient poor water which is somewhat acidic it occurs around springs on mountain slopes in places where neutral water enters more acidic bogs and in complex with wet acidic grassland the organic soils of poor fens are composed of peat as with all peatlands the rate of plant decomposition is slower than accumulation under wetland conditions as the peat surface thickens the plant community changes in response to lower nutrient availability and increasingly acidic and anaerobic chemistry poor fen is usually grazed by wild animals or livestock which prevents ecological succession to wet woodland natural disturbance factors influencing poor fens include fire flooding windthrow and insects similar to grazing a natural fire regime can prevent succession to woodland in the absence of fire a thick layer of leaf litter can encroach on the open mire which in turn stifles fen vegetation poor fens are covered

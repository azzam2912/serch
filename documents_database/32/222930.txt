the enharmonic scale uses dieses divisions nonexistent on most keyboards since modern standard keyboards have only half tone dieses more broadly an enharmonic scale is a scale in which using standard notation there is no exact equivalence between a sharpened note and the flattened note it is enharmonically related to such as in the quarter tone scale as an example f and g are equivalent in a chromatic scale the same sound is spelled differently but they are different sounds in an enharmonic scale see musical tuning musical keyboards which distinguish between enharmonic notes are called by some modern scholars enharmonic keyboards the enharmonic genus a tetrachord with roots in early greek music is only loosely related to enharmonic scales consider a scale constructed through pythagorean tuning a pythagorean scale can be constructed upwards by wrapping a chain of perfect fifths around an octave but it can also be constructed downwards by wrapping a chain of perfect fourths around the same octave by juxtaposing these two slightly different scales it is possible to create an enharmonic scale the following pythagorean scale is enharmonic in the above scale the following pairs of notes are said to be enharmonic in this example

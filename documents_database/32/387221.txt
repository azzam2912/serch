it is the site of the primary motor cortex that in humans is cytoarchitecturally defined as brodmann area 4 the precentral gyrus lies in front of the postcentral gyrus mostly on the lateral convex side of each cerebral hemisphere from which it is separated by the central sulcus its anterior border is represented by the precentral sulcus while inferiorly it borders to the lateral sulcus sylvian fissure medially it is contiguous with the paracentral lobule the internal pyramidal layer layer v of the precentral cortex contains giant 70 100 micrometers pyramidal neurons called betz cells which send long axons to the contralateral motor nuclei of the cranial nerves and to the lower motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord these axons form the corticospinal tract the betz cells along with their long axons are referred to as upper motor neurons umn there is a precise somatotopic representation of the different body parts in the primary motor cortex with the leg area located medially close to the midline and the head and face area located laterally on the convex side of the cerebral hemisphere cortical homunculus the arm and hand motor area is the largest and occupies the

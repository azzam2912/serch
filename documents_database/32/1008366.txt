the transcoder rate adaptation unit trau is the data rate conversion unit the pstn isdn switch is a switch for 64 kbit s voice current technology permits to decrease the bit rate in gsm radio interface it is 16 kbit s for full rate and 8 kbit s for half rate since msc is basically a pstn isdn switch its bit rate is still 64 kbit s that is why a rate conversion is required in between the bsc and msc transcoding is the compression of speech data from 64 kbit s to 13 12 2 6 5 kbit s in case fr efr hr respectively speech coding rate adaptation without transcoding allows tandem free operation tfo allowing the original encoded speech data to be carried in a 64 kbit s channel tfo offers benefits because transcoding can lead to a degradation of speech quality and requires computational resources for an ms to ms call the transmission path covers the radio access network ran as well as the core network cn since the transmission modes and coding standards are different for ran and cn speech data is converted transcoded at the transition points from ran to cn this conversion is

it is designed to study the physics of charm charmonium and light hadron decays it also performs studies of the tau lepton tests of qcd and searches for physics beyond the standard model the experiment started collecting data in the summer of 2008 bes iii receives electron positron collisions from bepc ii a circular collider with a circumference of 240 m bepc ii maintains a variable collision energy between 2 and 4 63 gev with a luminosity of 10 cm s each of the beams contains 93 electron or positron bunches of length 1 5 cm and a total current of 0 91 a the bes iii detector is a cylindrically symmetric 6 meter long and 7 meter diameter detector surrounding the interaction point of 2 beam pipe rings it has 4 major detector layers a main drift chamber mdc time of flight counter tof cesium iodide electromagnetic calorimeter csi emc and a muon counter muon chamber mc c the inner three layers are inside of a 1 tesla superconducting solenoid magnet the main drift chamber mdc is the first inner detector layer around the beam pipe and collision point the mdc s main purpose is to measure the momentum

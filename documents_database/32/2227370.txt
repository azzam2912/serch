simon that guarantees the existence of a non negative output vector that solves the equilibrium relation in the input output model where demand equals supply more precisely it states a condition for formula 1 under which the input output system has a solution formula 3 for any formula 4 here formula 5 is the identity matrix and formula 6 is called the input output matrix or leontief matrix after wassily leontief who empirically estimated it in the 1940s together they describe a system in which where formula 8 is the amount of the i th good used to produce one unit of the j th good formula 9 is the amount of the j th good produced and formula 10 is the amount of final demand for good i rearranged and written in vector notation this gives the first equation define formula 11 where formula 12 is an formula 13 matrix with formula 14 then the hawkins simon theorem states that the following two conditions are equivalent for a proof see morishima 1964 nikaido 1968 or murata 1977 condition ii is known as hawkins simon condition this theorem was independently discovered by david kotelyanski as it is referred to by

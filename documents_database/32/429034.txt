cd34 was first described on hematopoietic stem cells independently by civin et al and tindle et al as a cell surface glycoprotein and functions as a cell cell adhesion factor it may also mediate the attachment of hematopoietic stem cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells clinically it is associated with the selection and enrichment of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow transplants due to these historical and clinical associations cd34 expression is almost ubiquitously related to hematopoietic cells however it is actually found on many other cell types as well the cd34 protein is a member of a family of single pass transmembrane sialomucin proteins that show expression on early hematopoietic and vascular associated tissue however little is known about its exact function cd34 is also an important adhesion molecule and is required for t cells to enter lymph nodes it is expressed on lymph node endothelia whereas the l selectin to which it binds is on the t cell conversely under other circumstances cd34 has been shown to act as molecular teflon and block mast cell eosinophil and dendritic cell precursor adhesion and to facilitate opening of vascular lumina finally recent data suggest cd34

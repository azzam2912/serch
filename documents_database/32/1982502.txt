the cells exhibit a high nucleo cytoplasmic ratio prominent nucleoli and the expression of the glycolipid antigen ssea 3 they also express nestin and vimentin which are found in neuroepithelial precursor cells as well as microtubule associated proteins expressed in human neuroepithelium ntera 2 cells also accumulate cytoplasmic glycogen ntera 2 cells differentiate when exposed to retinoic acid and lose expression of ssea 3 differentiation produces neurons via asymmetric cell division and these cells form interconnected axon networks and express tetanus toxin receptors and neurofilament proteins by 10 14 days of exposure to retinoic acid ntera 2 cells begin to take on the morphological characteristics of neurons such as rounded cell bodies and processes ntera 2 cells can also produce a small number of oligodendrocyte type cells but they cannot differentiate into astrocytes because of their similarity to human embryonic stem cells ntera 2 cells are used to study the dopaminergic differentiation of neuronal precursor cells they have also been proposed as an in vitro test system for developmental neurotoxicity ntera 2 cells were originally isolated from a lung metastasis from a 22 year old male patient with primary embryonal carcinoma of the testis the tumor was xenografted onto a

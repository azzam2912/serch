routers are normally described by number of inputs by number of outputs e g 2x1 256x256 576x1152 some video routers by the use of additional drop in cards allow the system to be expanded for more inputs or outputs or to support other formats the signal format that the router transports can be anything from analogue composite video using pal and ntsc also multi format routers can route more than one digital video signal format serial digital interface sdi hd sdi component video some routers have the ability to internally convert digital to analog and analog to digital for hd video hdmi matrix switch can be used to switch any hdmi source to any connected hdtv using a hdmi connection more recent developments have allowed audio embedding and de embedding within the router this allows for audio to be routed along with video because any of the sources can be routed to any destination the internal arrangement of the router is arranged as a number of crosspoints which can be activated to pass the corresponding source signal to the desired destination this architecture has guaranteed bandwidth and is non blocking crosspoints can also be switched in the vertical interval to

it occurs in the oxidized zone of manganese silicate deposits with pyrite and rhodochrosite that have undergone regional and contact metamorphism it is defined as the manganese dominant member of the hexahydrite group chvaleticeite is named after the city chvaletice bohemia in the czech republic chvaleticeite and minerals like it have been studied for their hydrogen bonding and incongruent melting properties as they are predicted to form in the relative environments of mars and other bodies in the solar system the structure in chvaleticeite is made by hydrogen bonding in metallic sulfates due to the minute grain size of chvaleticeite typical single crystal methods could not be used through analogy with hexahydrite the guinier powder diffraction method was used to identify the following structural parameters space group c 2 c a 10 05 2 b 7 24 2 c 24 3 1 98 0 2 v 1754 z 8 dx 1 84 g cm a b c 1 3881 1 3 3564 chvaleticeite has an empirical formula of mn mg so 6 ho and is a member of the hexahydrite group with the space group c2 c chemical analysis was carried out using classical chemical methods sulfate was determined gravimetrically

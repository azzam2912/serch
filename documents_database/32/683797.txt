bombsights a feature of combat aircraft since world war i were first found on purpose designed bomber aircraft and then moved to fighter bombers and modern tactical aircraft as those aircraft took up the brunt of the bombing role a bombsight has to estimate the path the bomb will take after release from the aircraft the two primary forces during its fall are gravity and air drag which make the path of the bomb through the air roughly parabolic there are additional factors such as changes in air density and wind that may be considered but they are concerns only for bombs that spend a significant portion of a minute falling through the air those effects can be minimized by reducing the fall time by low level bombing or by increasing the speed of the bombs those effects are combined in the dive bomber however low level bombing also increases the danger to the bomber from ground based defences and accurate bombing from higher altitudes has always been desired that has led to a series of increasingly sophisticated bombsight designs dedicated to high altitude level bombing since their first application prior to world war i bombsights have gone through several

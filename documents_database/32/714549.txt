the vagovagal reflex controls contraction of the gastrointestinal muscle layers in response to distension of the tract by food this reflex also allows for the accommodation of large amounts of food in the gastrointestinal tracts the vagus nerve composed of both sensory afferents and parasympathetic efferents carries signals from stretch receptors osmoreceptors and chemoreceptors to dorsal vagal complex where the signal may be further transmitted to autonomic centers in the medulla efferent fibers of the vagus then carry signals to the gastrointestinal tract up to two thirds of the transverse colon coinciding with the second gi watershed point the vagovagal reflex is active during the receptive relaxation of the stomach in response to swallowing of food prior to it reaching the stomach when food enters the stomach a vagovagal reflex goes from the stomach to the brain and then back again to the stomach causing active relaxation of the smooth muscle in the stomach wall if vagal innervation is interrupted then intra gastric pressure increases this is a potential cause of vomiting due to the inability of the proximal stomach smooth muscle to undergo receptive relaxation the vagal afferents are activated during the gastric phase of digestion when the corpus

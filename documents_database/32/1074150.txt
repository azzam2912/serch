22 are a series of short piano pieces composed by russian composer sergei prokofiev between 1915 and 1917 they were premiered by prokofiev on april 15 1918 in petrograd soviet union they were written individually many for specific friends of prokofiev the pieces contain dissonant harmonies similar in nature to music composed by prokofiev s contemporaries schoenberg and scriabin although still retaining highly original concepts in both tonality and rhythm the pieces are whimsical musical vignettes and although dissonant are pleasant effervescent and bright as if prokofiev wished to show a slower more joyous side of his imaginative personality the overall effect is in the impressionist style not unlike a work of debussy in fact many of the movements are similar in style and sound because of the almost uniformly mellow style of the piece performers must have patience and a willingness to work on the relatively difficult technique required to capture the essence of this work because the movements are quite short individually lasting around one or two minutes most performances include a group of movements a complete performance lasts between eighteen and twenty minutes in august 1917 prokofiev played them for russian poet konstantin balmont among others at

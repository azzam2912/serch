in shear spinning the area of the final piece is approximately equal to that of the flat sheet metal blank the wall thickness is maintained by controlling the gap between the roller and the mandrel in shear forming a reduction of the wall thickness occurs before the 1950s spinning was performed on a simple turning lathe when new technologies were introduced to the field of metal spinning and powered dedicated spinning machines were available shear forming started its development in sweden figure 2 shows the schematics of a shear forming process 1 a sheet metal blank is placed between the mandrel and the chuck of the spinning machine the mandrel has the interior shape of the desired final component 2 a roller makes the sheet metal wrap the mandrel so that it takes its shape as can be seen s1 which is the initial wall thickness of the workpiece is reduced to s0 in shear forming the starting workpiece can have circular or rectangular cross sections on the other hand the profile shape of the final component can be concave convex or a combination of these two a shear forming machine will look very much like a conventional spinning machine

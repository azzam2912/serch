as a substituent it is known as a sulfo group a sulfonic acid can be thought of as sulfuric acid with one hydroxyl group replaced by an organic substituent the parent compound with the organic substituent replaced by hydrogen is the parent sulfonic acid hs o oh a tautomer of sulfurous acid s o oh salts or esters of sulfonic acids are called sulfonates a sulfonic acid is produced by the process of sulfonation usually the sulfonating agent is sulfur trioxide a particularly large scale application of this method is the production of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids in this reaction sulfur trioxide is an electrophile and the arene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution thiols can be oxidized to sulfonic acids certain sulfonic acids such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid are prepared by electrophilic fluorination of preformed sulfonic acids the net conversion can be represented simplistically sulfonic acids are strong acids they are commonly cited as being around a million times stronger than the corresponding carboxylic acid for example p toluenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid have p k values of 2 8 and 1 9 respectively while those of benzoic acid and acetic acid are 4 20 and 4 76 respectively however as a consequence of

specifically the angles the b rgi dunitz formula 1 and the flippin lodge formula 2 describe the trajectory or angle of attack of the nucleophile as it approaches the electrophile in particular when the latter is planar in shape this is called a nucleophilic addition reaction and it plays a central role in the biological chemistry taking place in many biosyntheses in nature and is a central tool in the reaction toolkit of modern organic chemistry e g to construct new molecules such as pharmaceuticals theory and use of these angles falls into the areas of synthetic and physical organic chemistry which deals with chemical structure and reaction mechanism and within a sub specialty called structure correlation because chemical reactions take place in three dimensions their quantitative description is in part a geometry problem two angles first the b rgi dunitz angle formula 1 and later the flippin lodge angle formula 2 were developed to describe the approach of the reactive atom of a nucleophile a point off of a plane to the reactive atom of an electrophile a point on a plane the formula 2 is an angle that estimates the displacement of the nucleophile at its elevation toward

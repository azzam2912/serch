as is the case with limits there are several definitions that put the intuitive concept into a form suitable for a mathematical treatment oscillation of a sequence of real numbers oscillation of a real valued function at a point and oscillation of a function on an interval or open set let formula 1 be a sequence of real numbers the oscillation formula 2 of that sequence is defined as the difference possibly infinite between the limit superior and limit inferior of formula 1 the oscillation is zero if and only if the sequence converges it is undefined if formula 5 and formula 6 are both equal to or both equal to that is if the sequence tends to or let formula 7 be a real valued function of a real variable the oscillation of formula 7 on an interval formula 9 in its domain is the difference between the supremum and infimum of formula 7 more generally if formula 12 is a function on a topological space formula 13 such as a metric space then the oscillation of formula 7 on an open set formula 15 is the oscillation of a function formula 7 of a real variable at a

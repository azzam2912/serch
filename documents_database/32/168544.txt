such a star has about 0 84 to 1 15 solar masses and surface temperature of between 5 300 and 6 000 k like other main sequence stars a g type main sequence star is converting the element hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion the sun the star to which the earth is gravitationally bound in the solar system and the object with the largest apparent magnitude is an example of a g type main sequence star g2v type each second the sun fuses approximately 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium converting about 4 million tons of matter to energy besides the sun other well known examples of g type main sequence stars include alpha centauri a tau ceti and 51 pegasi the term yellow dwarf is a misnomer because g type stars actually range in color from white for more luminous types like the sun to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous g type main sequence stars the sun is in fact white and its spectrum peaks in blue and green light but it can often appear yellow orange or red through earth s atmosphere due to atmospheric rayleigh

assuming the aircraft can 100 efficiently convert all of its kinetic energy to potential theoretically have a radius of 0 in the turn refer to centripetal force the aircraft has the same mechanical energy in both points the kinetic energy of the first point equaling the potential energy of the second formula 1 where m is the mass v is the speed h is the height of the body and g is standard gravity in si units used for most modern scientific work mass is measured in kilograms speed in metres per second height is in metres standard gravity in metre per second squared and the resulting energy is in joules notice that neither mass nor standard gravity were given subscripts indicating which point they correspond to this is because both are assumed constant this is mildly incorrect for both as an aircraft operates it consumes fuel oil etc which slightly decreases mass and since the standard gravity is inversely proportional to the distance between the body and earth and the aircraft is gaining altitude increasing said distance slightly decreasing standard gravity by dividing by standard gravity and mass and rewriting formula 2 as formula 3 as formula 4 shows

in the narrowest sense fredholm theory concerns itself with the solution of the fredholm integral equation in a broader sense the abstract structure of fredholm s theory is given in terms of the spectral theory of fredholm operators and fredholm kernels on hilbert space the theory is named in honour of erik ivar fredholm the following sections provide a casual sketch of the place of fredholm theory in the broader context of operator theory and functional analysis the outline presented here is broad whereas the difficulty of formalizing this sketch is of course in the details much of fredholm theory concerns itself with finding solutions for the integral equation this equation arises naturally in many problems in physics and mathematics as the inverse of a differential equation that is one is asked to solve the differential equation where the function is given and is unknown here stands for a linear differential operator for example one might take to be an elliptic operator such as in which case the equation to be solved becomes the poisson equation a general method of solving such equations is by means of green s functions namely rather than a direct attack one first finds the

in general a ligase catalyzes the following reaction or sometimes where the lowercase letters can signify the small dependent groups ligase can join two complementary fragments of nucleic acid and repair single stranded breaks that arise in double stranded dna during replication the common names of ligases often include the word ligase such as dna ligase an enzyme commonly used in molecular biology laboratories to join together dna fragments other common names for ligases include the word synthetase because they are used to synthesize new molecules biochemical nomenclature has sometimes distinguished synthetases from synthases and sometimes treated the words as synonyms under one definition synthases do not use energy from nucleoside triphosphates such as atp gtp ctp ttp and utp whereas synthetases do use nucleoside triphosphates it is also said that a synthase is a lyase a lyase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breaking of various chemical bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation often forming a new double bond or a new ring structure and does not require any energy whereas a synthetase is a ligase a ligase is an enzyme that binds two chemicals or compounds and thus requires energy however the joint commission on biochemical

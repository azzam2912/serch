a sensor detects attacking missiles its automatic warning cues the pilot to make a defensive maneuver and deploy the available countermeasures to disrupt missile tracking guided surface to air missile sam systems were developed during world war ii and began to make their presence felt in the 1950s in response electronic countermeasures ecm and flying tactics were developed to overcome them they proved to be quite successful provided that a reliable and timely threat warning was given analysis of aircraft losses due to enemy action since the 1960s shows that at least 70 of all losses were attributed to passive heat seeking i e infrared ir guided missiles this might be surprising given that radar guided sam systems have longer engagement ranges are faster have higher maneuvering potential carry larger warheads and are equipped with proximity fuzes the main reason why ir guided missiles were so effective was that it took much longer to develop effective warning systems against them most aircraft that were shot down never knew that the missiles were coming radar warning receivers on the other hand already proved their effectiveness by the early 1970s which considerably improved the survival rate of aircraft against radar threats the

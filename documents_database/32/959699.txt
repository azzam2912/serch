paleozoologists have been able to piece together a more complete outline of the evolutionary lineage of the modern horse than of any other animal much of this evolution took place in north america where horses originated but became extinct about 10 000 years ago the horse belongs to the order perissodactyla odd toed ungulates the members of which all share hooved feet and an odd number of toes on each foot as well as mobile upper lips and a similar tooth structure this means that horses share a common ancestry with tapirs and rhinoceroses the perissodactyls arose in the late paleocene less than 10 million years after the cretaceous paleogene extinction event this group of animals appears to have been originally specialized for life in tropical forests but whereas tapirs and to some extent rhinoceroses retained their jungle specializations modern horses are adapted to life on drier land in the much harsher climatic conditions of the steppes other species of equus are adapted to a variety of intermediate conditions the early ancestors of the modern horse walked on several spread out toes an accommodation to life spent walking on the soft moist grounds of primeval forests as grass species began

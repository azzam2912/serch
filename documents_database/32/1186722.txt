often the collection of all such groups is referred to using the notation formula 7 this collection has the structure of a graded ring in any category a functor must induce a corresponding morphism the pushforward is the morphism corresponding to the homology functor we build the pushforward homomorphism as follows for singular or simplicial homology first we have an induced homomorphism between the singular or simplicial chain complex formula 8 and formula 9 defined by composing each singular n simplex formula 10 formula 11 with formula 1 to obtain a singular n simplex of formula 13 formula 14 formula 15 then we extend formula 16 linearly via formula 17 the maps formula 16 formula 19 satisfy formula 20 where formula 21 is the boundary operator between chain groups so formula 22 defines a chain map we have that formula 16 takes cycles to cycles since formula 24 implies formula 25 also formula 16 takes boundaries to boundaries since formula 27 hence formula 16 induces a homomorphism between the homology groups formula 29 for formula 30 two basic properties of the push forward are a main result about the push forward is the homotopy invariance if two maps formula 38

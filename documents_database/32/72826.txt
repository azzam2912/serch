it is one solution to the visibility problem which is the problem of deciding which elements of a rendered scene are visible and which are hidden z buffering was first described in 1974 by wolfgang stra er in chapter 6 page 6 1 of his phd thesis the painter s algorithm is another common solution which though less efficient can also handle non opaque scene elements the z buffer uses the image space method for hidden surface detection a z buffer can refer to a data structure or to the method used to perform operations on that structure in a 3d rendering engine when an object is projected on the screen the depth z value of a generated pixel in the projected screen image is stored in a buffer the z buffer or depth buffer a z value is the measure of the perpendicular distance from a pixel on the projection plane to its corresponding 3d coordinate on a polygon in world space the z buffer has the same internal data structure as an image namely a 2d array with the only difference being that it stores a z value for each screen pixel instead of pixel data it has

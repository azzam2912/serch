the syllogism invented by fictional british civil servants has been quoted in the real british parliament the syllogism has also been quoted in american political discussion in yes prime minister the term is discussed between two high ranking civil servants who are concerned that the prime minister wants to implement a scheme to reform local government due to political opposition there in this issue as with many other issues humorously explored by the show the civil servants believe that doing anything is worse than doing nothing because actions tend to undermine the dominance of the civil service they identify the politician s logic as a fallacious categorical syllogism this invalid form of argument labeled aaa 2 among syllogisms commits the fallacy of the undistributed middle it says nothing about all things having four legs the middle term and thus the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises even if the premises are true the politician s syllogism similarly says nothing about all known somethings that could be done as is common with fallacious undistributed middle arguments it can also be seen as the fallacy of affirming the consequent when restated as an equivalent hypothetical syllogism

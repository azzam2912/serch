the website is currently down its purpose is to visualize and research common themes in body plans and strategies to achieve a fitness function of the artificial organisms generated and maintained by the system in their given environment the program was inspired by karl sims 1994 artificial evolution program evolved virtual creatures the program is run through volunteers who download the program from the home website and return information from completed simulations it is currently only available on windows and in some cases linux 3dvce uses evolutionary algorithms to simulate evolution the user sets the body plan restrictions maximum number of segment types branching segments length and depth limits and size limits and whether fitness score is scaled in relation to size limb interpenetration is also an option reproduction population settings include the size of each population and their run time how long each individual has to attain a fitness score percentage of individuals who get to reproduce tournament size what percentage sexually or asexually reproduce and selection type is then determined crossover rate determines what percentage of an individual is created via crossover of parents and mutation mutation rate in body and brain is then determined specific mathematical operations

a further six ships were built to the same design for the royal australian navy as river class destroyers there was considerable variation between the design and construction of ships within this class which should be considered as more of a post build grouping than a homogeneous class originally 20 ships including acheron were ordered but an additional three were completed by yarrow company three river class destroyers of the royal australian navy were laid down in british yards with a further three built in australia the acherons were generally repeats of the preceding acorn or h class although acheron herself and five others were builders specials they differed from the acorn s in having only two funnels both of which were short the foremost being thicker than the after stack the 12 pounder guns were mounted slightly further forward than in the acorn s fourteen of the class were completed to an admiralty standard design although those built by john brown and company at clydebank hind hornet and hydra had brown curtis type turbines and only two shafts archer and attack used steam at higher pressures and badger and beaver were completed with geared steam turbines for evaluation purposes

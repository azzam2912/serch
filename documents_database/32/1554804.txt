vertices of the rectified 8 simplex are located at the edge centers of the 8 simplex vertices of the birectified 8 simplex are located in the triangular face centers of the 8 simplex vertices of the trirectified 8 simplex are located in the tetrahedral cell centers of the 8 simplex e l elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope labeling it as s it is also called 0 for its branching coxeter dynkin diagram shown as the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the rectified 8 simplex can be most simply positioned in 9 space as permutations of 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 this construction is based on facets of the rectified 9 orthoplex e l elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope labeling it as s it is also called 0 for its branching coxeter dynkin diagram shown as the birectified 8 simplex is the vertex figure of the 1 honeycomb the cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the birectified 8 simplex can be most simply positioned in 9 space as permutations of 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 this construction is based on facets of the birectified

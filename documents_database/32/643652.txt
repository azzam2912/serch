it is primarily composed of carbon dioxide 95 32 molecular nitrogen 2 6 and argon 1 9 it also contains trace levels of water vapor oxygen carbon monoxide hydrogen and other noble gases the atmosphere of mars is much thinner than earth s the surface pressure is only about which is less than 1 of the earth s value the currently thin martian atmosphere prohibits the existence of liquid water at the surface of mars but many studies suggest that the martian atmosphere had been much thicker in the past the highest atmospheric density on mars is equal to the density found 35 km above the earth s surface the atmosphere of mars has been losing mass to space throughout history and the leakage of gases still continues today the atmosphere of mars is colder than earth s owing to the larger distance from sun mars receives less solar energy and has a lower effective temperature about 210 k the average surface emission temperature of mars is just 215 k which is comparable to inland antarctica the weaker greenhouse effect in the martian atmosphere 5 c versus 33 c on earth can be explained by the low abundance of other

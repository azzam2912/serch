a space probe may approach the moon travel through interplanetary space flyby orbit or land on other planetary bodies or enter interstellar space the space agencies of the ussr now russia and ukraine the united states the european union japan china india and israel have collectively launched probes to several planets and moons of the solar system as well as to a number of asteroids and comets approximately 15 missions are currently operational once a probe has left the vicinity of earth its trajectory will likely take it along an orbit around the sun similar to the earth s orbit to reach another planet the simplest practical method is a hohmann transfer orbit more complex techniques such as gravitational slingshots can be more fuel efficient though they may require the probe to spend more time in transit some high delta v missions such as those with high inclination changes can only be performed within the limits of modern propulsion using gravitational slingshots a technique using very little propulsion but requiring a considerable amount of time is to follow a trajectory on the interplanetary transport network first man made object to soft land on the moon or any other extra terrestrial

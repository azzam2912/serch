the group is sometimes called the simple thalloid liverworts thalloid because the members lack structures resembling stems or leaves and simple because their tissues are thin and relatively undifferentiated all species in the order have a small gametophyte stage and a smaller relatively short lived spore bearing stage although these plants are almost entirely restricted to regions with high humidity or readily available moisture the group as a whole is widely distributed and occurs on every continent except antarctica members of the metzgeriales typically are small and thin enough to be translucent with most of the tissues only a single cell layer in thickness because these plants are thin and relatively undifferentiated with little evidence of distinct tissues the metzgeriales are sometimes called the simple thalloid liverworts there is considerable diversity in vegetative structure of the metzgeriales as a rule simple thalloid liverworts do not have structures resembling leaves however a few genera such as fossombronia and symphyogyna are semileafy and have a thallus that is very deeply lobed thus giving the appearance of leafiness the genus phyllothallia has a more striking leafiness with paired lobes of tissue spaced regularly at swollen nodes along a central forked stem the several

it is used in some particle accelerators and storage rings to control the emittance of the particle beams in the machine this process uses the electrical signals that the individual charged particles generate in a feedback loop to reduce the tendency of individual particles to move away from the other particles in the beam it is accurate to think of this as adiabatic cooling or the reduction of entropy in much the same way that a refrigerator or an air conditioner cools its contents the technique was invented and applied at the intersecting storage rings and later the super proton synchrotron sps at cern in geneva switzerland by simon van der meer a physicist from the netherlands it was used to collect and cool antiprotons these particles were injected into the proton antiproton collider a modification of the sps with counter rotating protons and collided at a particle physics experiment for this work van der meer was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1984 he shared this prize with carlo rubbia of italy who proposed the proton antiproton collider this experiment discovered the w and z bosons fundamental particles that carry the weak nuclear force fermi national accelerator laboratory

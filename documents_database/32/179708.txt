a pictorial circuit diagram uses simple images of components while a schematic diagram shows the components and interconnections of the circuit using standardized symbolic representations the presentation of the interconnections between circuit components in the schematic diagram does not necessarily correspond to the physical arrangements in the finished device unlike a block diagram or layout diagram a circuit diagram shows the actual electrical connections a drawing meant to depict the physical arrangement of the wires and the components they connect is called artwork or layout physical design or wiring diagram circuit diagrams are used for the design circuit design construction such as pcb layout and maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment in computer science circuit diagrams are useful when visualizing expressions using boolean algebra circuit diagrams are pictures with symbols that have differed from country to country and have changed over time but are now to a large extent internationally standardized simple components often had symbols intended to represent some feature of the physical construction of the device for example the symbol for a resistor shown here dates back to the days when that component was made from a long piece of wire wrapped in such a manner as to

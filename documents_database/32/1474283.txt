in other words it is the difference between the time at which a task finishes and the time at which the task started wall time is thus different from cpu time which measures only the time during which the processor is actively working on a certain task the difference between the two can arise from architecture and run time dependent factors e g programmed delays or waiting for system resources to become available consider the example of a mathematical program that reports that it has used cpu time 0m0 04s wall time 6m6 01s this means that while the program was active for six minutes and six seconds during that time the computer s processor spent only 4 100 of a second performing calculations for the program conversely programs running in parallel on more than one processing unit can spend cpu time many times beyond their elapsed time since in concurrent computing the definition of elapsed time is non trivial the conceptualization of the elapsed time as measured on a separate independent wall clock is convenient another definition of wall time is the measurement of time via a separate independent clock as opposed to the local system s internal time

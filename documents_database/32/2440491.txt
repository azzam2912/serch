the method was discovered by elwyn berlekamp in 1970 as an auxiliary to the algorithm for polynomial factorization over finite fields the algorithm was later modified by rabin for arbitrary finite fields in 1979 the method was also independently discovered before berlekamp by other researchers the method was proposed by elwyn berlekamp in his 1970 work on polynomial factorization over finite fields his original work lacked a formal correctness proof and was later refined and modified for arbitrary finite fields by michael rabin in 1986 ren peralta proposed a similar algorithm for finding square roots in formula 1 in 2000 peralta s method was generalized for cubic equations let formula 3 be an odd prime number consider the polynomial formula 4 over the field formula 1 of remainders modulo formula 3 the algorithm should find all formula 7 in formula 1 such that formula 9 in formula 1 let formula 11 finding all roots of this polynomial is equivalent to finding its factorization into linear factors to find such factorization it is sufficient to split the polynomial into any two non trivial divisors and factorize them recursively to do this consider the polynomial formula 12 where formula 13 is some

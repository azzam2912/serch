buoyancy occurs due to a difference in indoor to outdoor air density resulting from temperature and moisture differences the result is either a positive or negative buoyancy force the greater the thermal difference and the height of the structure the greater the buoyancy force and thus the stack effect the stack effect helps drive natural ventilation air infiltration and fires e g the kaprun tunnel fire and king s cross underground station fire since buildings are not totally sealed at the very minimum there is always a ground level entrance the stack effect will cause air infiltration during the heating season the warmer indoor air rises up through the building and escapes at the top either through open windows ventilation openings or unintentional holes in ceilings like ceiling fans and recessed lights the rising warm air reduces the pressure in the base of the building drawing cold air in through either open doors windows or other openings and leakage during the cooling season the stack effect is reversed but is typically weaker due to lower temperature differences in a modern high rise building with a well sealed envelope the stack effect can create significant pressure differences that must be given

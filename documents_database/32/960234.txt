the spectral element method was introduced in a 1984 paper by a t patera the spectral method expands the solution in trigonometric series a chief advantage being that the resulting method is of very high order this approach relies on the fact that trigonometric polynomials are an orthonormal basis for formula 1 the spectral element method chooses instead a high degree piecewise polynomial basis functions also achieving a very high order of accuracy such polynomials are usually orthogonal chebyshev polynomials or very high order legendre polynomials over non uniformly spaced nodes in sem computational error decreases exponentially as the order of approximating polynomial therefore a fast convergence of solution to the exact solution is realized with fewer degrees of freedom of the structure in comparison with fem in structural health monitoring fem can be used for detecting large flaws in a structure but as the size of the flaw is reduced there is a need to use a high frequency wave with a small wavelength therefore the fem mesh must be much finer resulting in increased computational time and an inexact solution sem with fewer degrees of freedom per node can be useful for detecting small flaws non uniformity of

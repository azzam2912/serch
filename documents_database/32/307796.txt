the chemical formula is this yellow solid is the smallest peri fused pah one where the rings are fused through more than one face pyrene forms during incomplete combustion of organic compounds pyrene was first isolated from coal tar where it occurs up to 2 by weight as a peri fused pah pyrene is much more resonance stabilized than its five member ring containing isomer fluoranthene therefore it is produced in a wide range of combustion conditions for example automobiles produce about 1 g km oxidation with chromate affords perinaphthenone and then naphthalene 1 4 5 8 tetracarboxylic acid it undergoes a series of hydrogenation reactions and it is susceptible to halogenation diels alder additions and nitration all with varying degrees of selectivity bromination occurs at one of the 3 positions pyrene and its derivatives are used commercially to make dyes and dye precursors for example pyranine and naphthalene 1 4 5 8 tetracarboxylic acid it has strong absorbance in uv vis in three sharp bands at 330 nm in dcm the emission is close to the absorption but moving at 375 nm the morphology of the signals change with the solvent its derivatives are also valuable molecular probes via

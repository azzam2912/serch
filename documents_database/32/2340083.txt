it is known only from three examples collected in myanmar including a recent specimen from 2010 the burmese keelback water snake is relatively small in size and grow to a maximal length of between 4 and 6 centimetres the body is elongated with a moderately long tail and is covered by keeled scales on the dorsal section the species is endemic to myanmar and is believed to have an extensive habitat extending across the interior of the country the snake has been known to frequent wetlands and freshwater streams surrounding the irrawaddy river floodplain designating it as both terrestrial and aquatic and is therefore believed to be extant at a low altitude due to status as a water snake it is believed to be semi aquatic inhabiting both wetlands and river systems the species is believed to be non venomous but due to a lack of encounters this has not been confirmed by herpetologists to date if this hypothesis is proved correct it is likely the bite of the snake would only cause mild swelling and localised pain at present the population of the species is unclear due to the wide range of their habitat and size and trends are

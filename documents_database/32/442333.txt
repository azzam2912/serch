for atomic absorption spectrometers and as a frequency tuner for light sources such as lasers an hcl takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode an hcl usually consists of a glass tube containing a cathode an anode and a buffer gas usually a noble gas a large voltage across the anode and cathode will cause the buffer gas to ionize creating a plasma the buffer gas ions will then be accelerated into the cathode sputtering off atoms from the cathode both the buffer gas and the sputtered cathode atoms will in turn be excited by collisions with other atoms particles in the plasma as these excited atoms decay to lower states they will emit photons which can then be detected and a spectrum can be determined either the spectrum from the buffer gas or the sputtered cathode material itself or both may be of interest an hcl can also be used to tune light sources to a specific atomic transition by making use of the optogalvanic effect which is a result of direct or indirect photoionization by

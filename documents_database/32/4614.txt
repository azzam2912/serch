it is one of five languages descended from old west norse spoken in the middle ages the others being norwegian icelandic and the extinct norn and greenlandic norse faroese and icelandic its closest extant relative are not mutually intelligible in speech but the written languages resemble each other quite closely largely owing to faroese s etymological orthography around 900 the language spoken in the faroes was old norse which norse settlers had brought with them during the time of the settlement of faroe islands that began in 825 however many of the settlers were not from scandinavia but descendants of norse settlers in the irish sea region in addition women from norse ireland orkney or shetland often married native scandinavian men before settling in the faroe islands and iceland as a result the irish language has had some influence on both faroese and icelandic there is some debatable evidence of irish language place names in the faroes for example the names of mykines st ra d mun l tla d mun and argir have been hypothesized to contain celtic roots other examples of early introduced words of celtic origin are buttermilk cf middle irish tail piece of an animal cf

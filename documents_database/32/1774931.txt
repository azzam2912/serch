although its epicentre lay just offshore near ch shi city the shallow magnitude 6 1 m earthquake produced considerable shaking inland through much of the b s peninsula and lower ibaraki prefecture it occurred as a result of normal faulting in a seismically quiet region possibly in response to the magnitude 9 0 m 2011 t hoku earthquake despite its considerable magnitude the earthquake caused only localised light to moderate structural damage in chiba owing in part to japan s advanced earthquake engineering the most significant effects occurred in ch shi and katori cities where a few walls collapsed and several buildings sustained damage in funabashi city an elderly resident suffered a fatal heart attack during the quake and a falling object caused one minor injury in kisarazu city a seismically volatile country japan frequently experiences natural disasters such as earthquakes volcanic eruptions and tsunamis the entire archipelago forms a part of the pacific ring of fire a massive belt of volcanoes and trenches the largest of the islands honshu is characterised by numerous inland fault systems and large subduction zones which are a result of the interaction between several tectonic plates at the junction of the continental okhotsk plate

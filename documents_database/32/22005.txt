it is a white odorless solid soluble in water and several organic solvents it is produced industrially as a precursor to polyacrylamides which find many uses as water soluble thickeners and flocculation agents it is highly toxic likely to be carcinogenic and partly for that reason it is mainly handled as an aqueous solution the discovery in 2002 that some cooked foods contain acrylamide attracted significant attention to its possible biological effects epidemiological studies suggest it is unlikely that acrylamide consumption increases people s risk of developing cancer acrylamide can be prepared by the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile the reaction is catalyzed by sulfuric acid as well as various metal salts it is also catalyzed by the enzyme nitrile hydratase us demand for acrylamide was as of 2007 increased from in 2006 acrylamide arises in some cooked foods via a series of steps initiated by the condensation of the amino acid asparagine and glucose this condensation one of the maillard reactions followed by dehydrogenation produces n glucos 1 yl asparagine which upon pyrolysis generates some acrylamide the majority of acrylamide is used to manufacture various polymers especially polyacrylamide used as a thickening agent and in water treatment acrylamide is classified as

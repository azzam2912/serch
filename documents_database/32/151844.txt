the essence of zero knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information if proving a statement requires that the prover possess some secret information then the verifier will not be able to prove the statement to anyone else without possessing the secret information the statement being proved must include the assertion that the prover has such knowledge but not the knowledge itself otherwise the statement would not be proved in zero knowledge because it provides the verifier with additional information about the statement by the end of the protocol a zero knowledge proof of knowledge is a special case when the statement consists only of the fact that the prover possesses the secret information interactive zero knowledge proofs require interaction between the individual or computer system proving their knowledge and the individual validating the proof a protocol implementing zero knowledge proofs of knowledge must necessarily require interactive input from the verifier this interactive input is usually in the form of one or more challenges such that the responses from the prover will

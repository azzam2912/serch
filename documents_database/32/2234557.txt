the equation is with formula 2 the flow velocity of the steady base flow whose stability is to be studied and formula 3 is the cross stream direction i e perpendicular to the flow direction further formula 4 is the complex valued amplitude of the infinitesimal streamfunction perturbations applied to the base flow formula 5 is the wavenumber of the perturbations and formula 6 is the phase speed with which the perturbations propagate in the flow direction the prime denotes differentiation with respect to formula 7 the equation is named after lord rayleigh who introduced it in 1880 the orr sommerfeld equation introduced later for the study of stability of parallel viscous flow reduces to rayleigh s equation when the viscosity is zero rayleigh s equation together with appropriate boundary conditions most often poses an eigenvalue problem for given real valued wavenumber formula 5 and mean flow velocity formula 9 the eigenvalues are the phase speeds formula 10 and the eigenfunctions are the associated streamfunction amplitudes formula 11 in general the eigenvalues form a continuous spectrum in certain cases additional there may be a discrete spectrum of pairs on complex conjugate values of formula 12 since the wavenumber formula 5

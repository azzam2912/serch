it has also been known as endless railway wheels when fitted to road locomotives and were commonly fitted to steam traction engines they are very similar to pedrail wheels differing primarily in that they are not connected to the wheel directly but articulated to each other prior to wide adoption of continuous track on vehicles traction engines were cumbersome and not suited to crossing soft ground or the rough roads and farm tracks of the time the endless rails were flat boards or steel plates loosely attached around the outer circumference of the wheel which spread the weight of the vehicle over a larger surface and hence were less likely to get bogged by sinking into soft ground or skidding on slippery tracks an early version was patented by james boydell in august 1846 and february 1854 boydell worked with the british steam traction engine manufacturer charles burrell sons to produce road haulage engines from 1856 that used his continuous track design burrell later patented refinements of boydell s design a number of horse drawn wagons carts and gun carriages using boydell s design saw service with the british army in the crimean war october 1853 and february 1856 the

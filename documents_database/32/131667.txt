the uniprot database is an example of a protein sequence database as of 2013 it contained over 40 million sequences and is growing at an exponential rate historically sequences were published in paper form but as the number of sequences grew this storage method became unsustainable sequence databases can be searched using a variety of methods the most common usage is probably searching for sequences similar to a certain target protein or gene whose sequence is already known to the user the blast program is a popular method of this type records in sequence databases are deposited from a wide range of sources from individual researchers to large genome sequencing centers as a result the sequences themselves and especially the biological annotations attached to these sequences may vary in quality there is much redundancy as multiple labs may submit numerous sequences that are identical or nearly identical to others in the databases many annotations of the sequences are based not on laboratory experiments but on the results of sequence similarity searches for previously annotated sequences once a sequence has been annotated based on similarity to others and itself deposited in the database it can also become the basis for future

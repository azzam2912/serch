the complex outcrops at the exposed western end of the capricorn orogen a 1 000 km long arcuate belt of folded faulted and metamorphosed rocks between two archean cratons the pilbara craton to the north and the yilgarn craton to the south the gascoyne complex is thought to record the collision of these two different archean continental fragments during the capricorn orogeny at 1830 1780 ma the gascoyne complex is separated from the yilgarn craton to the south by a major fault the errabiddy shear zone to the east and northeast rocks of the complex are overlain unconformably by fine grained mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the edmund basin and collier basin formerly known as the bangemall basin several inliers of granite within these sedimentary basins also belong to the gascoyne complex to the west the gascoyne complex is overlain unconformably by sedimentary rocks of the phanerozoic carnarvon basin to the north schist of the gascoyne complex probably pass with decreasing intensity of metamorphism into metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of the upper wyloo group the gascoyne complex is divided into two parts the 1840 1620 ma northern and central gascoyne complex and the 2005 1970 ma glenburgh terrane in the southern gascoyne

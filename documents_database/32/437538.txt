a mesoscale convective system s overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones squall lines lake effect snow events polar lows and mesoscale convective complexes mccs and generally forms near weather fronts the type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across north america europe and asia with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours forms of mcs that develop within the tropics use either the intertropical convergence zone itcz or monsoon troughs as a focus for their development generally within the warm season between spring and fall one exception is that of lake effect snow bands which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water and occurs from fall through spring polar lows are a second special class of mcs which form at high latitudes during the cold season once the parent mcs dies later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex mcv mesoscale convective systems are important to the united states rainfall climatology over the great plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm

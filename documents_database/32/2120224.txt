this model tends to produce graphs containing communities subsets characterized by being connected with one another with particular edge densities for example edges may be more common within communities than between communities the stochastic block model is important in statistics machine learning and network science where it serves as a useful benchmark for the task of recovering community structure in graph data the stochastic block model takes the following parameters the edge set is then sampled at random as follows any two vertices formula 6 and formula 7 are connected by an edge with probability formula 8 an example problem is given a graph with formula 1 vertices where the edges are sampled as described recover the groups formula 3 if the probability matrix is a constant in the sense that formula 11 for all formula 12 then the result is the erd s r nyi model formula 13 this case is degenerate the partition into communities becomes irrelevant but it illustrates a close relationship to the erd s r nyi model the planted partition model is the special case that the values of the probability matrix formula 5 are a constant formula 15 on the diagonal and another constant

it combines programming concepts in a compact way before the program is written in some practical programming language its simplicity makes proving the correctness of programs easier using hoare logic the guarded command is the most important element of the guarded command language in a guarded command just as the name says the command is guarded the guard is a proposition which must be true before the statement is executed at the start of that statement s execution one may assume the guard to be true also if the guard is false the statement will not be executed the use of guarded commands makes it easier to prove the program meets the specification the statement is often another guarded command a guarded command is a statement of the form g s where if g is true the guarded command may be written simply s at the moment g is encountered in a calculation it is evaluated skip and abort are very simple as well as important statements in the guarded command language abort is the undefined instruction do anything the abort statement does not even need to terminate it is used to describe the program when formulating a proof in

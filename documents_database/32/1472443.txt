a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon s apparent diameter is smaller than the sun s blocking most of the sun s light and causing the sun to look like an annulus ring an annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the earth thousands of kilometres wide this eclipse will be unusual as the path of the annular eclipse will move to the north east 45 then north 0 north west 315 west 270 south west 225 south 180 and finally south east 135 across the arctic while most eclipse paths move west to east this reversal is only possible in polar regions this eclipse is also notable for the fact that the path of annularity will pass over north pole while the eclipse is visible primarily in northern canada in greenland and in north east of russian far east in the northeastern united states and canada the sun will be partially eclipsed at sunrise which will be between 5 and 6 a m edt animated path

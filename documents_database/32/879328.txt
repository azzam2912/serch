it is a white crystalline powder it is used in commercial secondary batteries an application that exploits its high solubility in non aqueous polar solvents specifically solutions of lithium hexafluorophosphate in carbonate blends of ethylene carbonate dimethyl carbonate diethyl carbonate and or ethyl methyl carbonate with a small amount of one or many additives like vinylene carbonate serve as state of the art electrolytes in lithium ion batteries this application also exploits the inertness of the hexafluorophosphate anion toward strong reducing agents such as lithium metal the salt is relatively stable thermally but loses 50 weight at 200 c 392 f it hydrolyzes near 70 c 158 f according to the following equation owing to the lewis acidity of the li ions lipf also catalyses the tetrahydropyranylation of tertiary alcohols in lithium ion batteries lipf reacts with lico in the following way which could be catalysed by small amounts of hf a recent research also proposed based on nuclear magnetic resonance results and density functional theory calculations that lipf could react in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate with alumina powder or alumina coated lithium ion batteries cathode materials to form lithium difluorophosphate and alumina oxyfluoride via the

in the cns they induce emesis muscarinic m receptors are expressed in regions of the brain that regulate insulin homeostasis such as the hypothalamus and dorsal vagal complex of the brainstem these receptors are highly expressed on pancreatic beta cells and are critical regulators of glucose homoestasis by modulating insulin secretion in general they cause smooth muscle contraction and increased glandular secretions they are unresponsive to ptx and ctx like the m muscarinic receptor m receptors are coupled to g proteins of class g which upregulate phospholipase c and therefore inositol trisphosphate and intracellular calcium as a signalling pathway the calcium function in vertebrates also involves activation of protein kinase c and its effects because the m receptor is g coupled and mediates an increase in intracellular calcium it typically causes constriction of smooth muscle such as that observed during bronchoconstriction however with respect to vasculature activation of m on vascular endothelial cells causes increased synthesis of nitric oxide which diffuses to adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells and causes their relaxation and vasodilation thereby explaining the paradoxical effect of parasympathomimetics on vascular tone and bronchiolar tone indeed direct stimulation of vascular smooth muscle m mediates vasoconstriction in pathologies wherein the

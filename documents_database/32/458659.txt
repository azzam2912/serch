the longest lived radioisotope is o with a half life of 122 24 seconds while the shortest lived isotope is o with a half life of 580 30 10 seconds the half life of the unbound o was not measured naturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable isotopes o o and o with o being the most abundant 99 762 natural abundance depending on the terrestrial source the standard atomic weight varies within the range of the conventional value is 15 999 the relative and absolute abundance of o is high because it is a principal product of stellar evolution and because it is a primary isotope meaning it can be made by stars that were initially made exclusively of hydrogen most o is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in stars the triple alpha reaction creates c which captures an additional he to make o the neon burning process creates additional o both o and o are secondary isotopes meaning that their nucleosynthesis requires seed nuclei o is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the cno cycle making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars most o

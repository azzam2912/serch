no space habitat has been constructed yet but many design concepts with varying degrees of realism have come both from engineers and from science fiction authors the term space habitat sometimes includes more broadly colonies built on or in a body other than earth such as the moon mars or an asteroid this article concentrates on self contained structures envisaged for micro g environments several motivations for building space colonies have been proposed see reasons for space colonization or space and survival a number of arguments are made for space habitats having a number of advantages space has an abundance of light produced from the sun in earth orbit this amounts to 1400 watts of power per square meter this energy can be used to produce electricity from solar cells or heat engine based power stations process ores provide light for plants to grow and to warm space colonies earth to space habitat trade would be easier than earth to planetary colony trade as colonies orbiting earth will not have a gravity well to overcome to export to earth and a smaller gravity well to overcome to import from earth space habitats may be supplied with resources from extraterrestrial places

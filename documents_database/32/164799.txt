the centroid of f is usually different from the centroid of its boundary curve c that is for example the volume of the torus with minor radius r and major radius r is this special case was derived by johannes kepler using infinitesimals let formula 5 be the area of formula 6 formula 7 the solid of revolution of formula 6 and formula 9 the volume of formula 7 suppose formula 6 starts in the formula 12 plane and rotates around the formula 13 axis the distance of the centroid of formula 6 from the formula 13 axis is its formula 16 coordinate and the theorem states that to show this let formula 6 be in the xz plane parametrized by formula 20 for formula 21 a parameter region since formula 22 is essentially a mapping from formula 23 to formula 23 the area of formula 6 is given by the change of variables formula where formula 27 is the determinant of the jacobian matrix of the change of variables the solid formula 7 has the toroidal parametrization formula 29 for formula 30 in the parameter region formula 31 and its volume is expanding the last equality holds because the

the g3mx was expected to be available on amd 800s series chipset for server market starting from 2009 but was officially cancelled together with the cancellation of socket g3 in early 2008 electrical limitations preclude connecting more than 2 unbuffered ddr sdram dimms or 4 buffered dimms to a single shared bus it is also impractical to manufacture a single chip with more than two ddr memory buses channels thus it is impossible to connect more than 8 dimms to a single chip this is typically the per processor limitation as well the obvious solution is to use a narrower higher speed bus to interface to memory and to implement it as a point to point link daisy chaining additional modules however intel have made two attempts at this neither hugely successful amd s answer to this is the g3mx chip this is very similar to the amb but is intended to be placed on the motherboard not on the dimm it can connect to multiple dimms but to minimize latency is not designed to be daisy chained the g3mx has an asymmetrical link to the processor to match typical memory usage patterns 20 differential signals supply read data to

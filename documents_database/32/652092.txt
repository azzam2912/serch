it can be formed by combining silver nitrate agno and potassium chromate kcro or sodium chromate nacro this reaction has been important in neuroscience as it is used in the golgi method of staining neurons for microscopy the silver chromate produced precipitates inside neurons and makes their morphology visible silver chromate is produced by the salt metathesis reaction of potassium chromate and silver nitrate in purified water the silver chromate will precipitate out of the aqueous reaction mixture the use of the compound itself in the laboratory is rather limited although its formation is used to indicate the endpoint in the titration of chloride with silver nitrate in the mohr method of argentometry the solubility of silver chromate is very low k 1 1x10 or 6 5x10 moles l the reactivity of chromate anion with silver is lower than halides chloride and others so in a mixture of both ions silver chloride will be formed only when no chloride or any halogen is left will silver chromate red brown form and precipitate out prior to the endpoint the solution has a milky lemon yellow appearance due to the color of the chromate ion and the precipitate of silver chloride already

however synchronization of coupled or driven chaotic oscillators is a phenomenon well established experimentally and reasonably well understood theoretically the stability of synchronization for coupled systems can be analyzed using master stability synchronization of chaos is a rich phenomenon and a multi disciplinary subject with a broad range of applications synchronization may present a variety of forms depending on the nature of the interacting systems and the type of coupling and the proximity between the systems this type of synchronization is also known as complete synchronization it can be observed for identical chaotic systems the systems are said to be completely synchronized when there is a set of initial conditions so that the systems eventually evolve identically in time in the simplest case of two diffusively coupled dynamics is described by where formula 3 is the vector field modeling the isolated chaotic dynamics and formula 4 is the coupling parameter the regime formula 5 defines an invariant subspace of the coupled system if this subspace formula 5 is locally attractive then the coupled system exhibit identical synchronization if the coupling vanishes the oscillators are decoupled and the chaotic behavior leads to a divergence of nearby trajectories complete synchronization occurs due

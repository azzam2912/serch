a strong cs us association means essentially that the cs signals or predicts the us one might say that before conditioning the subject is surprised by the us but after conditioning the subject is no longer surprised because the cs predicts the coming of the us the model casts the conditioning processes into discrete trials during which stimuli may be either present or absent the strength of prediction of the us on a trial can be represented as the summed associative strengths of all css present during the trial this feature of the model represented a major advance over previous models and it allowed a straightforward explanation of important experimental phenomena most notably the blocking effect failures of the model have led to modifications alternative models and many additional findings the model has had some impact on neural science in recent years as studies have suggested that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in mesostriatal da projections in the midbrain encodes for the type of prediction error detailed in the model the rescorla wagner model was created by yale psychologists robert a rescorla and allan r wagner in 1972 the first two assumptions were new in the rescorla wagner model

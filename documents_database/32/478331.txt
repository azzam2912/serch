it is stable in the interstellar medium ism due to the low temperature and low density of interstellar space the role that plays in the gas phase chemistry of the ism is unparalleled by any other molecular ion the trihydrogen cation is the simplest triatomic molecule because its two electrons are the only valence electrons in the system it is also the simplest example of a three center two electron bond system was first discovered by j j thomson in 1911 while studying the resultant species of plasma discharges he discovered something very odd using an early form of mass spectrometry he discovered a large abundance of a molecular ion with a mass to charge ratio of 3 he stated that the only two possibilities were c or since c would be very unlikely and the signal grew stronger in pure hydrogen gas he correctly assigned the species as the formation pathway was discovered by hogness lunn in 1925 they also used an early form of mass spectrometry to study hydrogen discharges they found that as the pressure of hydrogen increased the amount of increased linearly and the amount of decreased linearly in addition there was little h at any

the four genera are the following genera were formerly recognized and have now been merged into the genera above the largest genus platymantis is known to be paraphyletic solving this problem will likely lead to a more narrowly defined platymantis possibly by transferring some species together with batrachylodes to a larger ceratobatrachus in addition ingerana baluensis is placed incertae sedis in this family as opposed to dicroglossidae where the rest of ingerana are brown et al 2015 proposes the following new taxonomy for ceratobatrachidae based on molecular phylogenetics and data from recently discovered species brown s classification reduces the total number of genera down to 3 namely alcalus cornufer and platymantis liurana is a recently proposed genus of frogs from the eastern himalayan region that belongs to ceratobatrachidae liurana belongs to the subfamily liuraninae below is the fully expanded tree with the new species names listed for each subgenus ceratobatrachidae is distributed across island southeast asia as well as in the eastern himalayas all ceratobatrachidae lay eggs outside of water and undergo direct development where eggs hatch directly into froglets without free living tadpole stages

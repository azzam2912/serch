subsets of a common set x is a set whose elements are determined by the sequence in either of two equivalent ways 1 by upper and lower bounds on the sequence that converge monotonically to the same set analogous to convergence of real valued sequences and 2 by convergence of a sequence of indicator functions which are themselves real valued as is the case with sequences of other objects convergence is not necessary or even usual more generally again analogous to real valued sequences the less restrictive limit infimum and limit supremum of a set sequence always exist and can be used to determine convergence the limit exists if the limit infimum and limit supremum are identical see below such set limits are essential in measure theory and probability it is a common misconception that the limits infimum and supremum described here involve sets of accumulation points that is sets of x lim x where each x is in some a this is only true if convergence is determined by the discrete metric that is x x if there is n such that x x for all n n this article is restricted to that situation as it is the

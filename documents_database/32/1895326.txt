previously this genus was considered unculturable meaning that it could not be characterized through conventional laboratory techniques such as grow in culture due its unique requirements of anaerobic environment the genus was initially discovered through 16s rrna sequencing and bioinformatics analysis a methodology to analyze the microbiome by analyzing the sequence similarity parasutterella was determined to be related most closely to the genus sutterella and previously classified in the family alcaligenaceae in 2009 parasutterella excrementihominis was cultured and characterized in 2011 another species of parasutterella parasutterella secunda was discovered and both parasutterella and sutterella species were reclassified under the family sutterellaceae this reclassification occurred due to the similar biochemical potential in the sutterella and parasutterella genera different from other genera in the family alcaligenaceae to date parasutterella contains two cultured species and numerous uncultured species both cultured species were isolated from human feces and are considered to be part of the gut microbiome in a healthy individual parasutterella species are gram negative coccobacilli circular and rod shaped strictly or obligate anaerobic non motile bacteria when cultured colonies from both p excrementihominis and p secunda appeared translucent to beige in color convex and circular in shape and extremely small in size

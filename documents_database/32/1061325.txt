it is made up of a vertically hung mesh net a frame and a trough water condenses onto the array of parallel wires and collects at the bottom of the net this requires no external energy and is facilitated naturally through temperature fluctuation making it attractive for deployment in less developed areas the term fog fence comes from its long rectangular shape that resemble a fence but fog collectors are not confined to only this style of structure the efficiency of the fog collector is based on material of the net the size of the holes and filament and chemical coating efficient fog collectors can harvest up to 10 of the moisture in the air and inefficient collectors yield 2 of moisture an ideal location is a high altitude arid area near cold offshore currents where fog is common and therefore the fog collector can produce the highest yield fog collectors were first seen in nature as a technique for collecting water by some insects and foliage namib desert beetle live off water that condenses on their wings due to a pattern of alternating hydrophilic water attracting and hydrophobic water repelling regions redwood forest are able to survive on limited

it phosphorylates several key proteins that initiate activation of the dna damage checkpoint leading to cell cycle arrest dna repair or apoptosis several of these targets including p53 chk2 brca1 nbs1 and h2ax are tumor suppressors in 1995 the gene was discovered by dr yosef shiloh who named its product atm since he found that its mutations are responsible for the disorder ataxia telangiectasia in 1998 the shiloh and kastan laboratories independently showed that atm is a protein kinase whose activity is enhanced by dna damage throughout the cell cycle dna is monitored for damage damages result from errors during replication by products of metabolism general toxic drugs or ionizing radiation the cell cycle has different dna damage checkpoints which inhibit the next or maintain the current cell cycle step there are two main checkpoints the g1 s and the g2 m during the cell cycle which preserve correct progression atm plays a role in cell cycle delay after dna damage especially after double strand breaks dsbs atm together with nbs1 act as primary dsb sensor proteins different mediators such as mre11 and mdc1 acquire post translational modifications which are generated by the sensor proteins these modified mediator proteins then

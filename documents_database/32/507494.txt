he retired in 2016 heath brown is known for many striking results he proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers of the form x 2 y in collaboration with s j patterson in 1978 he proved the kummer conjecture on cubic gauss sums in its equidistribution form he has applied burgess s method on character sums to the ranks of elliptic curves in families he proved that every non singular cubic form over the rational numbers in at least ten variables represents 0 heath brown also showed that linnik s constant is less than or equal to 5 5 more recently heath brown is known for his pioneering work on the so called determinant method using this method he was able to prove a conjecture of serre in the four variable case in 2002 this particular conjecture of serre was later dubbed the dimension growth conjecture and this was almost completely solved by various works of browning heath brown and salberger by 2009 the london mathematical society has awarded heath brown the junior berwick prize 1981 the senior berwick prize 1996 and the p lya prize 2009 he was made a fellow of the royal society in 1993 and

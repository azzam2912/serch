it almost always refers to an inversion of the thermal lapse rate normally air temperature decreases with an increase in altitude during an inversion warmer air is held above cooler air the normal temperature profile with altitude is inverted an inversion traps air pollution such as smog close to the ground an inversion can also suppress convection by acting as a cap if this cap is broken for any of several reasons convection of any moisture present can then erupt into violent thunderstorms temperature inversion can notoriously result in freezing rain in cold climates usually within the lower atmosphere the troposphere the air near the surface of the earth is warmer than the air above it largely because the atmosphere is heated from below as solar radiation warms the earth s surface which in turn then warms the layer of the atmosphere directly above it e g by thermals convective heat transfer air temperature also decreases with an increase in altitude because higher air is at lower pressure and lower pressure results in lower temperature following the ideal gas law and adiabatic lapse rate given the right conditions the normal vertical temperature gradient is inverted such that the air is

the organ consists of a central ramified cord of an epithelial parenchyma embedded in connective tissue particularly rich in nerve fibers and sensory receptors close relations exist between epitthelial cells and nerve endings histochemically the parenchyma displays a characteristic pattern of various enzymes sporadically epithelial follicles containing colloidal material can be found the organ is surrounded by a dense perineurium like connective tissue originally the formation was known to embryologists only chievitz organ and was considered to be a transient rudimentary structure disappearing before birth in 1953 wolfgang zenker proved that the formation shows further development and can be found in adult humans with regularity since then quite a number of studies have been performed on its comparative anatomy histology cytochemistry and on ultrastructural level as soon as this structure had been shown to occur not only at all stages of human life but also in many other mammals and in reptiles and since no signs of involution could be detected in any of the species investigated it was renamed from a topographical point of view as juxtaoral organ by zenker and salzer 1962 the results of the studies of zenker and his group on this organ as well as

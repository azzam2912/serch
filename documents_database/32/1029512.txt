the species is also known as the polynesian megapode and as the niuafo ou megapode after the island of niuafo ou to which it was restricted for many years the specific epithet honours british consul william thomas pritchard the tongan megapode is the only remaining species of megapode in tonga out of the four or five species that were present on the islands in prehuman times as shown through the fossil record and indeed the only species of megapode that survives in polynesia similar extinctions occurred in fiji and new caledonia which apparently had three species in prehistory the species itself once had a more widespread distribution occurring across most of tonga samoa and niue the cause of all these extinctions and declines was the arrival of humans on the islands and the associated predation on adults and particularly eggs as well as predation by introduced species on niuafo ou the small human population and remoteness of its habitat probably saved the species the only megapode to survive human arrival in western polynesia the megapode nesting grounds were carefully controlled by the ruling chief thus assuring the continued survival of this population its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests

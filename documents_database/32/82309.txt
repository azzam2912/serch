this algorithm has an exponential search time to find the optimal next move so general methods for speeding it up are very useful barbara liskov created the general heuristic to speed tree search in a computer program to play chess endgames for her ph d thesis alpha beta pruning works best when the best moves are considered first this is because the best moves are the ones most likely to produce a cutoff a condition where the game playing program knows that the position it is considering could not possibly have resulted from best play by both sides and so need not be considered further i e the game playing program will always make its best available move for each position it only needs to consider the other player s possible responses to that best move and can skip evaluation of responses to worse moves it will not make the killer heuristic attempts to produce a cutoff by assuming that a move that produced a cutoff in another branch of the game tree at the same depth is likely to produce a cutoff in the present position that is to say that a move that was a very good move

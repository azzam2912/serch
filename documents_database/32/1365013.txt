triad was written while crosby was a member of the rock band the byrds who were at that time recording their fifth studio album the notorious byrd brothers the song s lyrics were largely inspired by the sexual freedom that crosby enjoyed at his home in beverly glen in los angeles however the song also features allusions to author robert a heinlein s science fiction novel stranger in a strange land with references to sister lovers and water brothers although the byrds did record triad and perform it live during a september 1967 engagement at the whisky a go go it was not included on the notorious byrd brothers album according to crosby bandmates roger mcguinn and chris hillman felt that its subject matter was too controversial with mcguinn allegedly deriding the song as a freak out orgy tune however this has since been denied by hillman who has stated i don t think it was a moral decision the song just didn t work that well david was drifting and bored and wanted to do something else and that song just added fuel to the fire there had been growing animosity between crosby and the rest of the band

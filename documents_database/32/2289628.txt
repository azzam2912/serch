for crops growing in soil this may be a result of low concentrations of mo in the soil as a whole i e the parent material of the soil is low in mo or because the soil mo is held in forms that are not available to plants sorption of mo is strongest in acid soils in plants the primary functions of mo are related to the valence changes that it undergoes a component of enzymes that catalyze diverse redox reactions this is because the element can exist in a variety of oxidation states oxidation states iv v and vi are important in biological systems a large number of mo deficiency disorders are associated with the disruption of the normal activity of several enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism these enzymes include molybdenum deficiency symptoms in most plants are associated with a build up of nitrate in the affected plant part this is a result of poor nitrate reductase activity symptoms include in legumes inhibition of n fixation may lead to pale yellowing nitrogen deficient plants the size and number of root nodules are often reduced molybdenum deficiency is common in many different types of soil some soils have low total

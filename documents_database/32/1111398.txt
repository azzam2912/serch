a typical ateg consists of four main elements a hot side heat exchanger a cold side heat exchanger thermoelectric materials and a compression assembly system ategs can convert waste heat from an engine s coolant or exhaust into electricity by reclaiming this otherwise lost energy ategs decrease fuel consumed by the electric generator load on the engine however the cost of the unit and the extra fuel consumed due to its weight must be also considered in ategs thermoelectric materials are packed between the hot side and the cold side heat exchangers the thermoelectric materials are made up of p type and n type semiconductors while the heat exchangers are metal plates with high thermal conductivity the temperature difference between the two surfaces of the thermoelectric module s generates electricity using the seebeck effect when hot exhaust from the engine passes through an exhaust ateg the charge carriers of the semiconductors within the generator diffuse from the hot side heat exchanger to the cold side exchanger the build up of charge carriers results in a net charge producing an electrostatic potential while the heat transfer drives a current with exhaust temperatures of 700 c 1300 f or more the temperature

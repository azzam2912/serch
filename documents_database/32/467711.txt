such an event could either double the genome of a single species autopolyploidy or combine those of two species allopolyploidy because of functional redundancy genes are rapidly silenced or lost from the duplicated genomes most paleopolyploids through evolutionary time have lost their polyploid status through a process called diploidization and are currently considered diploids e g baker s yeast arabidopsis thaliana and perhaps humans paleopolyploidy is extensively studied in plant lineages it has been found that almost all flowering plants have undergone at least one round of genome duplication at some point during their evolutionary history ancient genome duplications are also found in the early ancestor of vertebrates which includes the human lineage and another near the origin of the bony fishes evidence suggests that baker s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae which has a compact genome experienced polyploidization during its evolutionary history the term mesopolyploid is sometimes used for species that have undergone whole genome multiplication events whole genome duplication whole genome triplification etc in more recent history such as within the last 17 million years ancient genome duplications are widespread throughout eukaryotic lineages particularly in plants studies suggest that the common ancestor of poaceae the grass family which includes important

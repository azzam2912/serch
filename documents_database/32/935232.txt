they represent one subfamily of chemokine receptors a large family of g protein linked receptors that are known as seven transmembrane 7 tm proteins since they span the cell membrane seven times there are currently seven known cxc chemokine receptors in mammals named cxcr1 through cxcr7 cxcr1 and cxcr2 are closely related receptors that recognize cxc chemokines that possess an e l r amino acid motif immediately adjacent to their cxc motif cxcl8 otherwise known as interleukin 8 and cxcl6 can both bind cxcr1 in humans while all other elr positive chemokines such as cxcl1 to cxcl7 bind only cxcr2 they are both expressed on the surface of neutrophils in mammals cxcr3 is expressed predominantly on t cells t lymphocytes and also on other lymphocytes some b cells b lymphocytes and nk cells and is highly induced following cell activation there are two isoforms cxcr3 a and cxcr3 b it has three highly related ligands in mammals cxcl9 cxcl10 and cxcl11 cxcr4 also known as fusin is the receptor for a chemokine known as cxcl12 or sdf 1 and as with ccr5 is utilized by hiv 1 to gain entry into target cells this receptor has a wide cellular distribution

retrotransposons are a subset of transposable elements that use an rna intermediate and reverse transcribe themselves into the genome retrotransposon proliferation may lead to insertional mutagenesis disrupt the process of dna repair or cause errors during chromosomal crossover and so it is advantageous for an organism to possess the means to suppress or silence retrotransposon activity piwi interacting rna pirna and endogenous short interfering rna esirna are small rna fragments that partner with cleaving proteins to act as guides to a retrotransposon pirna and piwi protein complexes are a common defense mechanism against retrotransposons in the germline sperm or egg cells cells that are extremely vulnerable to retrotransposon induced mutations once retrotransposon rna has been encountered the pirna piwi protein complex cleaves the rna rendering it unable to reverse transcribe esirna and its protein complex may also function to promote heterochromatin creation near retrotransposon sites silencing the dna by making it difficult for dna polymerases to access it although it is unclear how pirnas and esirnas are produced it is thought that retrotransposon cleaving by piwi may produce new pirna in the so called ping pong theory production of pirna in both the male and female germline is known to

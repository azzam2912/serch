other signals such as sound or vibration can be converted to voltages and displayed oscilloscopes display the change of an electrical signal over time with voltage and time as the y and x axes respectively on a calibrated scale the waveform can then be analyzed for properties such as amplitude frequency rise time time interval distortion and others modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly originally calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument the oscilloscope can be adjusted so that repetitive signals can be observed as a continuous shape on the screen a storage oscilloscope can capture a single event and display it continuously so the user can observe events that would otherwise appear too briefly to see directly oscilloscopes are used in the sciences medicine engineering automotive and the telecommunications industry general purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work special purpose oscilloscopes may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an electrocardiogram early oscilloscopes used cathode ray tubes crts as their display element hence they were

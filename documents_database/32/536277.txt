thelytokous parthenogenesis is rare among animals and reported in about 1 500 species about 1 in 1000 of described animal species according to a 1984 study it is more common in invertebrates like arthropods but it can occur in vertebrates including salamanders fish and reptiles such as some whiptail lizards thelytoky can occur by different mechanisms each of which has a different impact on the level of homozygosity it is found in several groups of hymenoptera including apidae aphelinidae cynipidae formicidae ichneumonidae and tenthredinidae it can be induced in hymenoptera by the bacteria wolbachia and cardinium hymenoptera ants bees wasps and sawflies have a haplodiploid sex determination system they produce haploid males from unfertilized eggs arrhenotoky a form of parthenogenesis however in a few social hymenopterans queens or workers are capable of producing diploid female offspring by thelytoky the daughters produced may or may not be complete clones of their mother depending on the type of parthenogenesis that takes place the offspring can develop into either queens or workers examples of such species include the cape bee apis mellifera capensis mycocepurus smithii and clonal raider ant cerapachys biroi automixis is a form of thelytoky in automictic parthenogenesis meiosis takes place

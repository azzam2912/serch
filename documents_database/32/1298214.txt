the third variable is referred to as the moderator variable or simply the moderator the effect of a moderating variable is characterized statistically as an interaction that is a categorical e g sex ethnicity class or quantitative e g level of reward variable that affects the direction and or strength of the relation between dependent and independent variables specifically within a correlational analysis framework a moderator is a third variable that affects the zero order correlation between two other variables or the value of the slope of the dependent variable on the independent variable in analysis of variance anova terms a basic moderator effect can be represented as an interaction between a focal independent variable and a factor that specifies the appropriate conditions for its operation moderation analysis in the behavioral sciences involves the use of linear multiple regression analysis or causal modelling to quantify the effect of a moderating variable in multiple regression analyses regressing random variable y on x an additional term is added to the model this term is the interaction between x and the proposed moderating variable thus for a response y and two variables x and moderating variable x in this case the role of

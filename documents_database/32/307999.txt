oximes are drugs known for their ability to reverse the binding of organophosphorus compounds to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ache ache is an enzyme that removes acetylcholine from the synapse after it creates the required stimulation on the next nerve cell if it gets inhibited acetylcholine is not removed after the stimulation and multiple stimulations are made resulting in muscle contractions and paralysis organophosphates such as nerve gases are well known inhibitors of ache they bind to a specific place on the enzyme and prevent it from functioning normally by changing the oh group on the serine residue and by protonating quaternary nitrogen rn the nearby nitrogen atom located in the histidine residue oximes such as obidoxime pralidoxime and asoxime hi 6 are used to restore enzyme functionality they have greater affinity for the organic phosphate residue than the enzyme and they remove the phosphate group restore the oh to serine and turn nitrogen from histidine back into its rn form tertiary nitrogen this results in full enzyme recovery and the phosphate oxime compound is eliminated from the organism via urine obidoxime is more potent than pralidoxime and diacetyl monoxime oximes like these do have side effects and they include liver

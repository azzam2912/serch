pincer ligands are chelating agents that binds tightly to three adjacent coplanar sites in a meridional configuration the inflexibility of the pincer metal interaction confers high thermal stability to the resulting complexes this stability is in part ascribed to the constrained geometry of the pincer which inhibits cyclometallation of the organic substituents on the donor sites at each end in the absence of this effect cyclometallation is often a significant deactivation process for complexes in particular limiting their ability to effect c h bond activation the organic substituents also define a hydrophobic pocket around the reactive coordination site stoichiometric and catalytic applications of pincer complexes have been studied at an accelerating pace since the mid 1970s most pincer ligands contain phosphines reactions of metal pincer complexes are localized at three sites perpendicular to the plane of the pincer ligand although in some cases one arm is hemi labile and an additional coordination site is generated transiently early examples of pincer ligands not called such originally were anionic with a carbanion as the central donor site and flanking phosphine donors these compounds are referred to as pcp pincers although the most common class of pincer ligands features pcp donor sets variations

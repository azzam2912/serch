there is no current consensus among biologists on the questions of how sex in eukaryotes arose in evolution what basic function sexual reproduction serves and why it is maintained given the basic two fold cost of sex it is clear that it evolved over 1 2 billion years ago and that almost all species which are descendants of the original sexually reproducing species are still sexual reproducers including plants fungi and animals meiosis is a key event of the sexual cycle in eukaryotes it is the stage of the life cycle when a cell gives rise to two haploid cells gametes each having half as many chromosomes two such haploid gametes arising from different individual organisms fuse by the process of fertilization thus completing the sexual cycle meiosis is ubiquitous among eukaryotes it occurs in single celled organisms such as yeast as well as in multicellular organisms such as humans eukaryotes arose from prokaryotes more than 2 2 billion years ago and the earliest eukaryotes were likely single celled organisms to understand sex in eukaryotes it is necessary to understand 1 how meiosis arose in single celled eukaryotes and 2 the function of meiosis there are two conflicting theories on

this improves the material s mechanical properties and workability the hip process subjects a component to both elevated temperature and isostatic gas pressure in a high pressure containment vessel the pressurizing gas most widely used is argon an inert gas is used so that the material does not chemically react the chamber is heated causing the pressure inside the vessel to increase many systems use associated gas pumping to achieve the necessary pressure level pressure is applied to the material from all directions hence the term isostatic for processing castings metal powders can also be turned to compact solids by this method the inert gas is applied between and with being most common process soak temperatures range from for aluminium castings to for nickel based superalloys when castings are treated with hip the simultaneous application of heat and pressure eliminates internal voids and microporosity through a combination of plastic deformation creep and diffusion bonding this process improves fatigue resistance of the component primary applications are the reduction of microshrinkage the consolidation of powder metals ceramic composites and metal cladding hot isostatic pressing is thus also used as part of a sintering powder metallurgy process and for fabrication of metal matrix

with a sound similar to morcheeba and moloko this is the music you want on when you are zipping around the house with a dust cloth or mop it has been spinning while i have entertained dinner guests and works just as nicely adding this is a highly recommended disc and one that should be in all those collections that have some great vocally based funky electro sounds waterfront said john course and mrtimothy have captured the sensual and uplifting essence of skin while introducing a house funk beat and the result is the refreshingly ambient remixed album

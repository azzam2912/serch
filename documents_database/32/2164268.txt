these fossils document foraging activities of slender cell wide exploratory hyphae when these hit a source of food they produced secondary branches that grew back down the original filament covered themselves with an envelope and served as pipes to shuttle nutrients to other parts of the organism today mycelium with this growth pattern is observed in the mushroom forming fungi the form genus ornatifilum was erected by burgess and edwards in 1991 to describe tubular fossils retrieved by acid maceration from the late silurian it was originally intended as a form genus to facilitate stratigraphy and environmental reconstruction the fossils do not display enough features to classify them confidently even at a kingdom level fossils first described as ornatifilum lornensis correspond to the foraging hyphae of tortotubus they are tubes of around 10 m diameter with an ornamented granular surface texture these fossils were compared to late silurian ludlow epoch fossils retrieved from the burgsvik beds by sherwood pike and gray and the genus was used when similar fossils were recovered from the scottish island of kerrera by charles wellman ten years later similar unornamented filaments are known from the usa they have a complex appearance surface ornament which covers

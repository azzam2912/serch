the accounting method often gives a more intuitive account of the amortized cost of an operation than either aggregate analysis or the potential method note however that this does not guarantee such analysis will be immediately obvious often choosing the correct parameters for the accounting method requires as much knowledge of the problem and the complexity bounds one is attempting to prove as the other two methods the accounting method is most naturally suited for proving an o 1 bound on time the method as explained here is for proving such a bound a set of elementary operations which will be used in the algorithm is chosen and their costs are arbitrarily set to 1 the fact that the costs of these operations may differ in reality presents no difficulty in principle what is important is that each elementary operation has a constant cost each aggregate operation is assigned a payment the payment is intended to cover the cost of elementary operations needed to complete this particular operation with some of the payment left over placed in a pool to be used later the difficulty with problems that require amortized analysis is that in general some of the operations will

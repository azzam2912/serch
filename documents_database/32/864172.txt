these axons were first described as mossy fibers by santiago ram n y cajal as they displayed varicosities along their lengths that gave them a mossy appearance the axons that make up the pathway emerge from the basal portions of the granule cells and pass through the hilus or polymorphic cell layer of the dentate gyrus before entering the stratum lucidum of ca3 granule cell synapses tend to be glutamatergic i e excitatory though immunohistological data has indicated that some synapses contain neuropeptidergic elements including opiate peptides such as dynorphin and enkephalin there is also evidence for co localization of both gabaergic i e inhibitory and glutamatergic neurotransmitters within mossy fiber terminals gabaergic and glutamatergic co localization in mossy fiber boutons has been observed primarily in the developing hippocampus but in adulthood evidence suggests that mossy fiber synapses may alternate which neurotransmitter is released through activity dependent regulation mossy fibers in the hippocampus project from the dentate gyrus to ca3 the pathway consists of varicose granule cell axons that terminate on the dendrites of hilar mossy cells and pyramidal cells in ca3 they form three morphologically different synaptic terminals which include large mossy terminals filopodial extensions within the mossy terminals

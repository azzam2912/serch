there are several such notions according to the concept of differential algebra used the intention is to include equations formed by means of differential operators in which the coefficients are rational functions of the variables e g the hypergeometric equation algebraic differential equations are widely used in computer algebra and number theory a simple concept is that of a polynomial vector field in other words a vector field expressed with respect to a standard co ordinate basis as the first partial derivatives with polynomial coefficients this is a type of first order algebraic differential operator it is usually not the case that the general solution of an algebraic differential equation is an algebraic function solving equations typically produces novel transcendental functions the case of algebraic solutions is however of considerable interest the classical schwarz list deals with the case of the hypergeometric equation in differential galois theory the case of algebraic solutions is that in which the differential galois group g is finite equivalently of dimension 0 or of a finite monodromy group for the case of riemann surfaces and linear equations this case stands in relation with the whole theory roughly as invariant theory does to group representation theory

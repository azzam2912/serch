these transformations preserve angles and map generalized circles into generalized circles where a generalized circle means either a circle or a line loosely speaking a circle with infinite radius many difficult problems in geometry become much more tractable when an inversion is applied the concept of inversion can be generalized to higher dimensional spaces to invert a number in arithmetic usually means to take its reciprocal a closely related idea in geometry is that of inverting a point in the plane the inverse of a point p with respect to a reference circle with center o and radius r is a point p lying on the ray from o through p such that this is called circle inversion or plane inversion the inversion taking any point p other than o to its image p also takes p back to p so the result of applying the same inversion twice is the identity transformation on all the points of the plane other than o to make inversion an involution it is necessary to introduce a point at infinity a single point placed on all the lines and extend the inversion by definition to interchange the center o and this point at

spectral lines are often used to identify atoms and molecules these fingerprints can be compared to the previously collected fingerprints of atoms and molecules and are thus used to identify the atomic and molecular components of stars and planets which would otherwise be impossible spectral lines are the result of interaction between a quantum system usually atoms but sometimes molecules or atomic nuclei and a single photon when a photon has about the right amount of energy to allow a change in the energy state of the system in the case of an atom this is usually an electron changing orbitals the photon is absorbed then it will be spontaneously re emitted either in the same frequency as the original or in a cascade where the sum of the energies of the photons emitted will be equal to the energy of the one absorbed assuming the system returns to its original state a spectral line may be observed either as an emission line or an absorption line which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source an absorption line is produced when photons from a hot broad spectrum source

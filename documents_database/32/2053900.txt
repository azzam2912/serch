it is a facility used to develop characterize and test mechanical components the facility allows for the testing of the component and it offers measurement of several physical variables associated to the functionality of the component such components could be electromechanical motors or tools the intended use of the test stand is for compliance testing of predetermined desired values and fatigue testing a sophisticated mechanical component test stand houses several integrated measurement and control imc components such as sensors data acquisition devices and actuators to control the component the sensors measure several physical variables such as information gathered from the sensors is processed and logged through the use of data acquisition systems actuators allow for attaining a desired state test stands for mechanical devices are often custom built according to the requirements of the customer they often include a feedback control system research and development r d activities on mechanical components have necessitated sophisticated mechanical component test stands for example automobile oems or aviation oems are usually interested in developing mechanical components that meet the following objectives consequently r d mechanical component test stands perform a variety of exercises including measurement control and recording of several relevant engine variables

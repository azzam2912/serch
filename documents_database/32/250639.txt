during this time sunspot and solar flare activity diminishes and often does not occur for days at a time the date of the minimum is described by a smoothed average over 12 months of sunspot activity so identifying the date of the solar minimum usually can only happen 6 months after the minimum takes place solar minima are not generally correlated with changes in climate but recent studies have shown a correlation with regional weather patterns solar minimum is contrasted with the solar maximum where there may be hundreds of sunspots solar minima and maxima are the two extremes of the sun s 11 year activity cycle at a maximum the sun is peppered with sunspots solar flares erupt and the sun hurls billion ton clouds of electrified gas into space sky watchers may see more auroras and space agencies must monitor radiation storms for astronaut protection power outages satellite malfunctions communication disruptions and gps receiver malfunctions are just a few of the things that can happen during a solar maximum at a solar minimum there are fewer sunspots and solar flares subside sometimes days or weeks go by without a spot their non linear character makes predictions of solar

coupled with high operating frequencies this has led to unacceptable levels of power dissipation memory accounts for a high proportion of the power consumed and this contribution may be reduced by optimizing data organizationthe way data is stored power optimization in high memory density electronic systems has become one of the major challenges for devices such as mobile phones embedded systems and wireless devices as the number of cores on a single chip is growing the power consumption by the devices also increases studies on power consumption distribution in smartphones and data centers have shown that the memory sub system consumes around 40 of the total power in server systems the study reveals that the memory consumes around 1 5 times the core power consumption system level buses such as off chip buses or long on chip buses between ip blocks are often major sources of energy consumption due to their large load capacitance experimental results have shown that the bus activity for memory access can be reduced to 50 by organizing the data consider the case of compiling the code written in c language most existing c compilers place a multidimensional array in row major form that is row

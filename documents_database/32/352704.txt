vector mesons have been seen in experiments since the 1960s and are well known for their spectroscopic pattern of masses the vector mesons contrast with the pseudovector mesons which also have a total spin 1 but instead have even parity the vector and pseudovector mesons are also dissimilar in that the spectroscopy of vector mesons tends to show nearly pure states of constituent quark flavors whereas pseudovector mesons and scalar mesons tend to be expressed as composites of mixed states since the development of the quark model by murray gell mann and independently by george zweig as well the vector mesons have demonstrated the spectroscopy of pure states the fact that the rho meson and omega meson have nearly equal mass centered on 770 while the phi meson has a higher mass around indicates that the light quark vector mesons appear in nearly pure states with the meson having a nearly 100 percent amplitude of hidden strangeness this nearly pure states characteristic of the vector mesons is not at all evident in the pseudoscalar meson or scalar meson multiplets and may be only slightly realized among the tensor meson and pseudovector meson multiplets this fact makes the vector mesons an

the name literally means many sporangia plant the clade includes all land plants embryophytes except for the bryophytes liverworts mosses and hornworts whose sporophytes are normally unbranched even if a few exceptional cases occur while the definition is independent of the presence of vascular tissue all living polysporangiophytes also have vascular tissue i e are vascular plants or tracheophytes fossil polysporangiophytes are known that have no vascular tissue and so are not tracheophytes paleobotanists distinguish between micro and megafossils microfossils are primarily spores either single or in groups megafossils are preserved parts of plants large enough to show structure such as stem cross sections or branching patterns dawson a canadian geologist and paleobotanist was the first to discover and describe a megafossil of a polysporangiophyte in 1859 he published a reconstruction of a devonian plant collected as a fossil from the gasp region of canada which he named psilophyton princeps the reconstruction shows horizontal and upright stem like structures no leaves or roots are present the upright stems or axes branch dichotomously and have pairs of spore forming organs sporangia attached to them cross sections of the upright axes showed that vascular tissue was present he later described other specimens

oxidation by o in superacids could be by way of the production of protonated molecular oxygen it is the conjugate acid of dioxygen the proton affinity of dioxygen o is 4 4 ev protonated molecular oxygen is of interest in trying to detect dioxygen in space because earth s atmosphere is full of o its spectrum from a space object is impossible to observe from the ground however ho should be much more detectable reaction of o with hydrogen o h ho h the reaction of the trihydrogen cation with dioxygen is approximately thermoneutral o h ho h when atomic hydrogen created in an electric discharge is rapidly cooled with oxygen and condensed in solid neon several reactive ions and molecules are produced these include ho hydroperoxyl hohoh ho ho hoho as well as ho this reaction also forms hydrogen peroxide ho and hydrogen tetroxide ho in the infrared spectrum ho the v band due to vibrating o h has a band head at 3016 73 cm a helium complex he oh also is known oh appears to react rapidly with hydrogen oh h o h oh also reacts with dinitrogen and water oh h o o ho the protonated

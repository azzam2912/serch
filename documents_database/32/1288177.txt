that is every convex polyhedron forms a 3 connected planar graph and every 3 connected planar graph can be represented as the graph of a convex polyhedron for this reason the 3 connected planar graphs are also known as polyhedral graphs branko gr nbaum has called this theorem the most important and deepest known result on 3 polytopes the theorem appears in a 1922 paper of ernst steinitz after whom it is named it can be proven by mathematical induction as steinitz did by finding the minimum energy state of a two dimensional spring system into three dimensions or by using the circle packing theorem several extensions of the theorem are known in which the polyhedron that realizes a given graph has additional constraints for instance every polyhedral graph is the graph of a convex polyhedron with integer coordinates or the graph of a convex polyhedron all of whose edges are tangent to a common midsphere in higher dimensions the problem of characterizing the graphs of convex polytopes remains open an undirected graph is a system of vertices and edges each edge connecting two of the vertices from any polyhedron one can form a graph by letting the vertices of

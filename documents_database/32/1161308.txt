as gills are the primitive condition of vertebrates all vertebrate embryos develop pharyngeal arches though the eventual fate of these arches varies between taxa in jawed fish the first arch develops into the jaws the second into the hyomandibular complex with the posterior arches supporting gills in amphibians and reptiles many elements are lost including the gill arches resulting in only the oral jaws and a hyoid apparatus remaining in mammals and birds the hyoid is still more simplified all basal vertebrates breathe with gills the gills are carried right behind the head bordering the posterior margins of a series of openings from the esophagus to the exterior each gill is supported by a cartilagenous or bony gill arch bony fish have three pairs of arches cartilaginous fish have five to seven pairs and primitive jawless fish have seven the vertebrate ancestor no doubt had more arches as some of their chordate relatives have more than 50 pairs of gills in amphibians and some primitive bony fish the larvae bear external gills branching off from the gill arches these are reduced in adulthood their function taken over by the gills proper in fish and by lungs in most amphibians some

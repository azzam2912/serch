the expected shortfall at q level is the expected return on the portfolio in the worst formula 1 of cases es is an alternative to value at risk that is more sensitive to the shape of the tail of the loss distribution expected shortfall is also called conditional value at risk cvar average value at risk avar and expected tail loss etl es estimates the risk of an investment in a conservative way focusing on the less profitable outcomes for high values of formula 2 it ignores the most profitable but unlikely possibilities while for small values of formula 2 it focuses on the worst losses on the other hand unlike the discounted maximum loss even for lower values of formula 2 the expected shortfall does not consider only the single most catastrophic outcome a value of formula 2 often used in practice is 5 expected shortfall is considered a more useful risk measure than var because it is a coherent and moreover a spectral measure of financial portfolio risk it is calculated for a given quantile level formula 2 and is defined to be the mean loss of portfolio value given that a loss is occurring at or below

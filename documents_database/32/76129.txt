this term most commonly applies to works from the classical world although it is increasingly used in relation to modern works a work may be lost to history through the destruction of an original manuscript and all later copies in contrast to lost or extinct works surviving copies may be referred to as extant works or commonly small fragments of works have survived by being found by archaeologists during investigations or accidentally by anybody for example the nag hammadi library scrolls works also survived when they were reused as bookbinding materials quoted or included in other works or as palimpsests where an original document is imperfectly erased so the substrate on which it was written can be reused the discovery in 1822 of cicero s de re publica was one of the first major recoveries of a lost ancient text from a palimpsest another famous example is the discovery of the archimedes palimpsest which was used to make a prayer book almost 300 years after the original work was written a work may be recovered in a library as a lost or mislabeled codex or as a part of another book codex well known but not recovered works are described

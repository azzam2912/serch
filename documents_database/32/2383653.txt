the star is too faint to be seen with the naked eye having an apparent visual magnitude of 8 97 the distance to hd 3167 can be determined from its annual parallax shift of as measured by the gaia space observatory yielding a range of 154 light years it has a relatively high proper motion traversing the celestial sphere at the rate of per year since it was first photographed during the palomar observatory sky survey in 1953 it had moved over by 2017 the star is moving away from the earth with an average heliocentric radial velocity of 19 5 km s this is an ordinary k type main sequence star with a stellar classification of k0 v and no significant variability the star has 86 of the mass of the sun and 86 of the sun s radius this gives it a bulk density of it is a chromospherically inactive star and is radiating 56 of the sun s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5 261 k the spin of the star displays a relatively low projected rotational velocity of around 1 7 km s it has a near solar metallicity a term astronomers

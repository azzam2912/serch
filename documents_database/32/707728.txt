that is it describes the effect of converting a discrete time signal to a continuous time signal by holding each sample value for one sample interval it has several applications in electrical communication a zero order hold reconstructs the following continuous time waveform from a sample sequence x n assuming one sample per time interval t the function formula 3 is depicted in figure 1 and formula 4 is the piecewise constant signal depicted in figure 2 the equation above for the output of the zoh can also be modeled as the output of a linear time invariant filter with impulse response equal to a rect function and with input being a sequence of dirac impulses scaled to the sample values the filter can then be analyzed in the frequency domain for comparison with other reconstruction methods such as the whittaker shannon interpolation formula suggested by the nyquist shannon sampling theorem or such as the first order hold or linear interpolation between sample values in this method a sequence of dirac impulses x t representing the discrete samples x n is low pass filtered to recover a continuous time signal x t even though this is not what a dac

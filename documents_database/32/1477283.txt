they are named after their creator leslie orgel orgel diagrams are restricted to only show weak field i e high spin cases and offer no information about strong field low spin cases because orgel diagrams are qualitative no energy calculations can be performed from these diagrams also orgel diagrams only show the symmetry states of the highest spin multiplicity instead of all possible terms unlike a tanabe sugano diagram orgel diagrams will however show the number of spin allowed transitions along with their respective symmetry designations in an orgel diagram the parent term p d or f in the presence of no ligand field is located in the center of the diagram with the terms due to that electronic configuration in a ligand field at each side there are two orgel diagrams one for d d d and d configurations and the other with d d d and d configurations in an orgel diagram lines with the same russell saunders terms will diverge due to the non crossing rule but all other lines will be linear also for the d orgel diagram the left side contains d and d tetrahedral and d and d octahedral complexes the right side contains

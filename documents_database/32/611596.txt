john skilling discovered another degenerate example the great disnub dirhombidodecahedron by relaxing the condition that edges must be single due to its geometric realization having some double edges where 4 faces meet it is a degenerate uniform polyhedron but not strictly a uniform polyhedron the number of edges is ambiguous because the underlying abstract polyhedron has 360 edges but 120 pairs of these have the same image in the geometric realization so the geometric realization has 120 single edges and 120 double edges where 4 faces meet for a total of 240 edges the euler characteristic of the abstract polyhedron is 96 if the pairs of coinciding edges in the geometric realization are considered to be single edges then it has only 240 edges and euler characteristic 24 the vertex figure has 4 square faces passing through the center of the model it may be constructed as the exclusive or blend of the great dirhombicosidodecahedron and compound of twenty octahedra it shares the same edge arrangement as the great dirhombicosidodecahedron but has a different set of triangular faces the vertices and edges are also shared with the uniform compounds of 20 octahedra or 20 tetrahemihexahedra 180 of the edges are

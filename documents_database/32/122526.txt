steroid hormones can be grouped into two classes corticosteroids typically made in the adrenal cortex hence cortico and sex steroids typically made in the gonads or placenta within those two classes are five types according to the receptors to which they bind glucocorticoids mineralocorticoids corticosteroids androgens estrogens and progestogens sex steroids vitamin d derivatives are a sixth closely related hormone system with homologous receptors they have some of the characteristics of true steroids as receptor ligands steroid hormones help control metabolism inflammation immune functions salt and water balance development of sexual characteristics and the ability to withstand illness and injury the term steroid describes both hormones produced by the body and artificially produced medications that duplicate the action for the naturally occurring steroids the natural steroid hormones are generally synthesized from cholesterol in the gonads and adrenal glands these forms of hormones are lipids they can pass through the cell membrane as they are fat soluble and then bind to steroid hormone receptors which may be nuclear or cytosolic depending on the steroid hormone to bring about changes within the cell steroid hormones are generally carried in the blood bound to specific carrier proteins such as sex hormone binding globulin

it can be constructed as the tensor product of graphs g k it is also called the kronecker double cover canonical double cover or simply the bipartite double of g it should not be confused with a cycle double cover of a graph a family of cycles that includes each edge twice in a connected graph that is not bipartite only one double cover is bipartite but when the graph is bipartite or disconnected there may be more than one for this reason toma pisanski has argued that the name bipartite double cover should be deprecated in favor of the canonical double cover or kronecker cover names which are unambiguous the bipartite double cover of g has two vertices u and w for each vertex v of g two vertices u and w are connected by an edge in the double cover if and only if v and v are connected by an edge in g for instance below is an illustration of a bipartite double cover of a non bipartite graph g in the illustration each vertex in the tensor product is shown using a color from the first term of the product g and a shape from the

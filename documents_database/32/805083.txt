the technique is a refinement of ordinary photoemission spectroscopy studying photoemission of electrons from a sample achieved usually by illumination with soft x rays arpes is one of the most direct methods of studying the electronic structure of the surface of solids arpes gives information on the direction speed and scattering process of valence electrons in the sample being studied usually a solid this means that information can be gained on both the energy and momentum of an electron resulting in detailed information on band dispersion and fermi surface the technique is also known as arups angle resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy when using ultraviolet light as opposed to x rays to generate photoemission in condensed matter physics band mapping refers to the process of detection and measurement of the photoelectrons emitted from a surface at different emission angles this process is employed in arpes which is then used to investigate the electronic structure of solids solid surfaces and interfaces by employing the band mapping process several fundamental physical properties of a solid can be determined these include but are not limited to the following the electronic states in the solid are described by energy bands which have associated energy band

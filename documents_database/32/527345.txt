the arrangement provides a directional half space pickup pattern while delivering a relatively phase coherent output signal the boundary microphone can be used as a piano mic or on hockey boards for body check sound effects it is also commonly used to record full room sound by being mounted on a wall when used to record a soloist or small musical ensemble along with the room acoustics a boundary microphone prevents phase interference between direct and reflected sound resulting in a natural sound with a flatter frequency response than can be obtained with a stand mounted microphone at the same distance explanation below a conventional microphone placed on or a few inches above a hard boundary surface will pick up the desired direct sound as well as delayed sound reflecting off the boundary surface the direct and delayed reflected sounds will combine at the microphone to create comb filtering with constructive and destructive interference causing peaks and valleys in the frequency response the delay time of the reflection for most microphones would be in the range of 0 1 to 1 milliseconds corresponding to cancellation frequencies of a few kilohertz and octave multiples since these frequencies are audible the cancellation

informally it states that one can simultaneously choose an element from every non empty set the axiom of global choice states that there is a global choice function meaning a function such that for every non empty set z z is an element of z the axiom of global choice cannot be stated directly in the language of zfc zermelo fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice as the choice function is a proper class and in zfc one cannot quantify over classes it can be stated by adding a new function symbol to the language of zfc with the property that is a global choice function this is a conservative extension of zfc every provable statement of this extended theory that can be stated in the language of zfc is already provable in zfc alternatively g del showed that given the axiom of constructibility one can write down an explicit though somewhat complicated choice function in the language of zfc so in some sense the axiom of constructibility implies global choice in fact zfc proves that in the language extended by the symbol of unary function the axiom of constructibility implies that if is said explicitly definable function

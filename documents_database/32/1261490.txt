it can be realised as the bifurcation set of a certain family of functions the bifurcation set is the set of parameter values of the family which yield functions with degenerate singularities this is not the same as the bifurcation diagram in dynamical systems assume that m is an n dimensional smooth hypersurface in real n 1 space assume that m has no points where the second fundamental form is degenerate from the article affine differential geometry there exists a unique transverse vector field over m this is the affine normal vector field or the blaschke normal field a special i e det 1 affine transformation of real n 1 space will carry the affine normal vector field of m onto the affine normal vector field of the image of m under the transformation consider a local parametrisation of m let formula 1 be an open neighbourhood of 0 with coordinates formula 2 and let formula 3 be a smooth parametrisation of m in a neighbourhood of one of its points the affine normal vector field will be denoted by formula 4 at each point of m it is transverse to the tangent space of m i e for a

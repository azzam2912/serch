flip graphs are special cases of geometric graphs among noticeable flip graphs one finds the 1 skeleton of polytopes such as associahedra or cyclohedra a prototypical flip graph is that of a convex formula 1 gon formula 2 the vertices of this graph are the triangulations of formula 2 and two triangulations are adjacent in it whenever they differ by a single interior edge in this case the flip operation consists in exchanging the diagonals of a convex quadrilateral these diagonals are the interior edges by which two triangulations adjacent in the flip graph differ the resulting flip graph is both the hasse diagram of the tamari lattice and the 1 skeleton of the formula 4 dimensional associahedron this basic construction can be generalized in a number of ways let formula 5 be a triangulation of a finite set of points formula 6 under some conditions one may transform formula 5 into another triangulation of formula 8 by a flip this operation consists in modifying the way formula 5 triangulates a circuit a minimally affinely dependent subset of formula 8 more precisely if some triangulation formula 11 of a circuit formula 12 is a subset of formula 5 and if

since its refurbishment in october 1996 it has been used primarily as an inertial confinement fusion icf research facility operated by sandia national laboratories it gathers data to aid in computer modeling of nuclear weapons and eventual nuclear fusion pulsed power plants the z machine is located at sandia s main site in albuquerque new mexico the z machine s origins can be traced to the department of energy needing to replicate the fusion reactions of a thermonuclear bomb in a lab environment to better understand the physics involved since the 1970s the doe had been looking into ways to generate electricity from fusion reactions with continuous reactions such as tokamaks or discrete fusion of small balls of light atoms since at the time lasers were far from having the required power the main approach considered was heavy ion fusion however major advances such as q switching and mode locking made lasers an option culminating in the national ignition facility and the heavy ion fusion programs became more or less dormant in 1985 the review of doe s program by the national academies stated the energy crisis is dormant for the time being heavy ion fusion machines were tasked to

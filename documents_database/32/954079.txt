smith is a regents professor of physics at arizona state university he is an australian experimental physicist and his research is focussed on using the electron microscope to study the microstructure of different materials he is a pioneer in high resolution relectron microscopy technique and is very well known in his field his interests are focused on thin films nanostructures novel materials and magnetism his basic research centers around the development of quantitative high resolution transmission electron microscopy aided by computer controlled microscope operation and image simulation which enables direct determination of atomic structure in defective materials his research also involves using electron microscopy based methods to characterize advanced materials such as semiconductor heterostructures magnetic thin films and multilayers and nanostructures semiconductor systems of interest include ternary and quaternary group iii nitride alloys for light emitting diodes and lasers and ii vi alloys such as mercury cadmium telluride for detectors of infra red radiation magnetic materials being studied include shape memory alloys as well as magnetic tunnel junctions which are based on ferromagnet insulator ferromagnet combinations that have promising applications for non volatile high storage density recording media off axis electron holography is a particularly powerful approach since it permits

it is part of the glycine decarboxylase complex the gene is about 6 kb in length and consists of nine exons the 5 flanking region of the gene lacks typical tataa sequence but has a single defined transcription initiation site detected by the primer extension method two putative glucocorticoid responsive elements and a putative thyroid hormone responsive element are present the amt gene has been localized to 3p21 2 p21 1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization the 1209 base pair open reading frame encodes 403 amino acid precursor protein and the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature peptide shows 90 and 68 homology to that of bovine and chicken counterpart respectively the protein encoded by this gene has its crystal structure resolved at 2 angstroms the most recent model contains two monomers related by a non crystallographic 2 fold axis 1176 water molecules and 11 molecules sulfate ions in an asymmetric unit several dimeric interactions are observed among the residues on the n terminal loop on helix d and the flank on either side of strand 8 of the two monomers the protein encoded by amt catalyzes the release of ammonia and the transfer of a methylene carbon unit

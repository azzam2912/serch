the name capsulatus coming from the alga s large capsule which surrounds the cell this unicellular algal species was discovered in 1990 in the west pacific ocean and has characteristic reproduction methods as well as an interesting and potentially exploitable morphology this is the only species in the genus though various strains exist for example uri 266g is the atlantic clone the most notable feature of p capsulatus s morphology is its large capsule composed of an exo polysaccharide which has been dubbed capsulan capsulan is thought to be synthesised in the golgi and then secreted through the decapore a specialised circle of 10 pores through the cell wall after exiting the decapore capsulan becomes visible and it is thought that it cross links with divalent ions in the seawater research is currently underway to find potential applications for capsulan and how to maximise its production the capsule s function is not clearly defined but various explanations have been suggested one is that it offers protection to newly divided cells which lack a thick cell wall another is that it provides a template for daughter cells to synthesise their new cell wall the capsule may also interfere with filter feeding

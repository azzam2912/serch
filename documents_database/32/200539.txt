it has fungistatic that is it inhibits the division of fungal cells and bacteriostatic inhibits bacterial cell division properties and is used in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis the pyrithione ligands which are formally monoanions are chelated to zn via oxygen and sulfur centers in the crystalline state zinc pyrithione exists as a centrosymmetric dimer see figure where each zinc is bonded to two sulfur and three oxygen centers in solution however the dimers dissociate via scission of one zn o bond this compound was first described in the 1930s pyrithione is the conjugate base derived from 2 mercaptopyridine n oxide cas 1121 31 9 a derivative of pyridine n oxide zinc pyrithione is best known for its use in treating dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis particularly in dandruff shampoos it also has antibacterial properties and is effective against many pathogens from the streptococcus and staphylococcus genera its other medical applications include treatments of psoriasis eczema ringworm fungus athletes foot dry skin atopic dermatitis tinea and vitiligo due to its low solubility in water 8 ppm at neutral ph zinc pyrithione is suitable for use in outdoor paints and other products that provide protection against mildew and algae it is an

examples include the equatorial undercurrents of the pacific atlantic and indian oceans the california undercurrent and the agulhas undercurrent the deep thermohaline circulation in the atlantic and bottom gravity currents near antarctica the forcing mechanisms vary for these different types of subsurface currents the most common of these is the density current epitomized by the thermohaline current the density current works on a basic principle the denser water sinks to the bottom separating from the less dense water and causing an opposite reaction from it there are numerous factors controlling density one is the salinity of water a prime example of this being the mediterranean atlantic exchange the saltier waters of the mediterranean sink to the bottom and flow along there until they reach the ledge between the two bodies of water at this point they rush over the ledge into the atlantic pushing the less saline surface water into the mediterranean another factor of density is temperature thermohaline literally meaning heat salty currents are very influenced by heat cold water from glaciers icebergs etc descends to join the ultra deep cold section of the worldwide thermohaline current after spending an exceptionally long time in the depths it eventually heats

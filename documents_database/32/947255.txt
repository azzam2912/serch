this approach combines user interfaces models of computation math and analysis input output signals technology abstractions and various deployment target it allows domain experts or non implementation experts to access to design capabilities where they would traditionally need to outsource a system design expert this approach to system design is a super set of electronic system level esl design graphical system design expands on the eda based esl definition to include other types of embedded system design including industrial machines and medical devices many of these expanded applications can be defined as the long tail applications graphical system design is an approach to designing an entire system using more intuitive graphical software and off the shelf non custom hardware devices to refine the design create initial prototypes and even use for the few run of deployments the approach may involve algorithm engineering the approach can prove successful when designers need to get something to market quickly medical video or with a team of non embedded experts like boston engineering to create a mechatronics based machine graphical system design is a complementary but encompassing platform based approach that includes embedded and electronic system design implementation and verification tools esl and graphical

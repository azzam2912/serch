it is one of the most important phosphorus chlorides others being pcl and pocl pcl finds use as a chlorinating reagent it is a colourless water sensitive and moisture sensitive solid although commercial samples can be yellowish and contaminated with hydrogen chloride the structures for the phosphorus chlorides are invariably consistent with vsepr theory the structure of pcl depends on its environment gaseous and molten pcl is a neutral molecule with trigonal bipyramidal geometry and d symmetry the hypervalent nature of this species as well as for see below can be explained with the inclusion of non bonding molecular orbitals molecular orbital theory or resonance valence bond theory this trigonal bipyramidal structure persists in nonpolar solvents such as cs and ccl in the solid state pcl is an ionic compound formulated in solutions of polar solvents pcl undergoes self ionization dilute solutions dissociate according to the following equilibrium at higher concentrations a second equilibrium becomes more prevalent the cation and the anion are tetrahedral and octahedral respectively at one time pcl in solution was thought to form a dimeric structure pcl but this suggestion is not supported by raman spectroscopic measurements ascl and sbcl also adopt trigonal bipyramidal structures the

it is placed in the aneurysm s parent artery covering the neck in order to divert blood flow and determine a progressive thrombosis of the sac flow diverting stents consist of structural cobalt chrome or nitinol alloy wires and often a set of radiopaque wires woven together in a flexible braid flow diverters are treatment for intracranial aneurysms alternative to endosaccular coil embolization although the techniques can be combined especially in large giant aneurysms it is mainly effective in wide neck unrupted saccular aneurysms that are difficult to coil because of the tendency of the coils to fill the parent artery referred to as prolapse another situation is fusiform shape or circumferential aneurysms prior to flow diverters many intracranial aneurysms went untreated the efficacy of flow diverters can be evaluated using a grading system developed by researchers at oxford neurovascular and neuroradiology research unit kamran et al 2011 commonly referred to as flow diverter grading system or kamran grading system after receiving a cerebral flow diverter patients are placed on dual antiplatelet therapy for an extended period of time to reduce the likelihood of peri procedural and post procedural thromboembolic complications the degree of aneurysm occlusion is graded on a

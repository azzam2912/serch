it is based on a semiconductor formed between a photo sensitized anode and an electrolyte a photoelectrochemical system the modern version of a dye solar cell also known as the gr tzel cell was originally co invented in 1988 by brian o regan and michael gr tzel at uc berkeley and this work was later developed by the aforementioned scientists at the cole polytechnique f d rale de lausanne until the publication of the first high efficiency dssc in 1991 michael gr tzel has been awarded the 2010 millennium technology prize for this invention the dssc has a number of attractive features it is simple to make using conventional roll printing techniques is semi flexible and semi transparent which offers a variety of uses not applicable to glass based systems and most of the materials used are low cost in practice it has proven difficult to eliminate a number of expensive materials notably platinum and ruthenium and the liquid electrolyte presents a serious challenge to making a cell suitable for use in all weather although its conversion efficiency is less than the best thin film cells in theory its price performance ratio should be good enough to allow them to

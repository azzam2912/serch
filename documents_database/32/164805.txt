catabolism is a degradative phase of metabolism in which large molecules are converted into smaller and simpler molecules which involves two types of reactions first hydrolysis reactions in which catabolism is the breaking apart of molecules into smaller molecules to release energy examples of catabolic reactions are digestion and cellular respiration where sugars and fats are broken down for energy breaking down a protein into amino acids or a triglyceride into fatty acids or a disaccharide into monosaccharides are all hydrolysis or catabolic reactions second oxidation reactions involve the removal of hydrogens and electrons from an organic molecule anabolism is the biosynthesis phase of metabolism in which smaller simple precursors are converted to large and complex molecules of the cell anabolism has two classes of reactions the first are dehydration synthesis reactions these involve the joining of smaller molecules together to form larger more complex molecules these include the formation of carbohydrates proteins lipids and nucleic acids the second are reduction reactions in which hydrogens and electrons are added to a molecule whenever that is done molecules gain energy the term amphibolic was proposed by b davis in 1961 to emphasise the dual metabolic role of such pathways these pathways

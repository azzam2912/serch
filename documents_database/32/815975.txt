different societies classify kinship relations differently and therefore use different systems of kinship terminology for example some languages distinguish between consanguine and affinal uncles i e the brothers of one s parents and the husbands of the sisters of one s parents respectively whereas others have only one word to refer to both a father and his brothers kinship terminologies include the terms of address used in different languages or communities for different relatives and the terms of reference used to identify the relationship of these relatives to ego or to each other anthropologist lewis henry morgan 1818 1881 performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world though much of his work is now considered dated he argued that kinship terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions for example most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes the difference between a brother and a sister and between generations the difference between a child and a parent moreover he argued kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and marriage although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than blood however morgan also observed that different languages and by extension societies organize these distinctions differently

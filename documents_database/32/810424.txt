drfms are typically used in radar jamming although applications in cellular communications are becoming more common a drfm system is designed to digitize an incoming rf input signal at a frequency and bandwidth necessary to adequately represent the signal then reconstruct that rf signal when required the most significant aspect of drfm is that as a digital duplicate of the received signal it is coherent with the source of the received signal as opposed to analog memory loops there is no signal degradation caused by continuously cycling the energy through a front end amplifier which allows for greater range errors for reactive jamming and allows for predictive jamming a drfm may modify the signal prior to retransmitting which can alter the signature of the false target adjusting its apparent radar cross section range velocity and angle drfms present a significant obstacle for radar sensors the earliest reference to a digital means of storage of rf pulse signals is an article in the jan feb 1975 issue of electronic warfare a publication of the association of old crows written by sheldon c spector entitled a coherent microwave memory using digital storage the loopless memory loop since a drfm system is designed

service is provided to a subscriber by manually wiring a twisted pair called a jumper wire between the telephone line and the relevant dsl or pots line circuit in broadcast engineering a distribution frame is a location within an apparatus room through which all signals audio video or data pass with the ability to arbitrarily route and connect sources and destinations between studios and other internal and external points connections can either be soldered or made using terminal blocks because the frame may carry live broadcast signals it may be considered part of the airchain in data communication a building distribution frame bdf houses data switches etc distribution frames for specific types of signals often have specific acronyms distribution frames may grow to extremely large sizes in major installations audio distribution frames can have as many as 10 000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire but some urban exchanges have about 250 000 wires on their mdf installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour intensive task leading to attempts in the industry to devise so called active

extensibility is a measure of the ability to extend a system and the level of effort required to implement the extension extensions can be through the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality the principle provides for enhancements without impairing existing system functions an extensible system is one whose internal structure and dataflow are minimally or not affected by new or modified functionality for example recompiling or changing the original source code might be unnecessary when changing a system s behavior either by the creator or other programmers because software systems are long lived and will be modified for new features and added functionalities demanded by users extensibility enables developers to expand or add to the software s capabilities and facilitates systematic reuse some of its approaches include facilities for allowing users own program routines to be inserted and the abilities to define new data types as well as to define new formatting markup tags extensible design in software engineering is to accept that not everything can be designed in advance a light software framework which allows for changes is provided instead small commands are made to prevent from losing the element of extensibility following the principle

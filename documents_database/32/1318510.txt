im nails have long been used to treat fractures of long bones of the body gerhard k ntscher is credited with the first use of this device in 1939 during world war ii for soldiers with fractures of the femur prior to that treatment of such fractures was limited to traction or plaster both of which required long periods of inactivity im nails resulted in earlier return to activity for the soldiers sometimes even within a span of a few weeks since they share the load with the bone rather than entirely supporting the bone the earliest im nails were triangular or v shaped in cross section later they were modified to their present and more rotationally stable clover leaf shape several modifications and shapes were introduced subsequently for various bones such as v nails for tibia radius and ulna nails rusch nails etc although stainless steel was used for older im nails titanium has several advantages including lower mechanical failure rates and improved biocompatibility however the biggest problem with the earlier designs was the failure to prevent collapse or rotation in inherently unstable fractures this was addressed by the introduction of the concept of locking of the nails using

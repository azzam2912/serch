in contrast to chromatin immunoprecipitation chip based methods of identifying dna double strand breaks dsbs by labeling dna repair proteins bless utilizes biotinylated dna linkers to directly label genomic dna in situ which allows for high specificity enrichment of samples on streptavidin beads and the subsequent sequencing based dsb mapping to nucleotide resolution the biotinylated linker is designed to form a hairpin structure that specifically labels dsbs and not single strand dna breaks the linker has a blunt ligatable end with a known barcode sequence that labels the site of ligation as well as an xhoi restriction enzyme recognition site adjacent to the barcode the hairpin loop of the linker is covalently bound to a biotin molecule allowing for subsequent enrichment of labeled dna with streptavidin beads use of biotin labels allows for specific binding without disruption of dna due to the small size of the marker because biotin also has high affinity to streptavidin further highly specific purification can be performed on streptavidin beads following the induction of dsbs cells are fixed with formaldehyde lysed and treated with proteinases to purify intact nuclei the initial fixation step stabilizes chromatin and prevents the formation of additional dsbs during sample preparation

the simplest vanadate ion is the tetrahedral orthovanadate anion which is present in e g sodium orthovanadate and in solutions of vo in strong base ph 13 conventionally this ion is represented with a single double bond however this is a resonance form as the ion is a regular tetrahedron with four equivalent oxygen atoms additionally a range of polyoxovanadate ions exist which include discrete ions and infinite polymeric ions there are also vanadates such as rhodium vanadate rhvo which has a statistical rutile structure where the rh and v ions randomly occupy the ti positions in the rutile lattice that do not contain a lattice of cations and balancing vanadate anions but are mixed oxides in chemical nomenclature when vanadate forms part of the name it indicates that the compound contains an anion with a central vanadium atom e g ammonium hexafluorovanadate is a common name for the compound nh vf with the iupac name of ammonium hexafluoridovanadate iii some examples of discrete ions are some examples of polymeric infinite ions are in these ions vanadium exhibits tetrahedral square pyramidal and octahedral coordination in this respect vanadium shows similarities to tungstate and molybdate whereas chromium however has a more

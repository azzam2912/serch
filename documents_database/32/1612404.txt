the studies were performed by eli menkin and paul beeson in 1943 1948 on the fever producing properties of proteins released from rabbit peritoneal exudate cells these studies were followed by contributions of several investigators who were primarily interested in the link between fever and infection inflammation the basis for the term interleukin was to streamline the growing number of biological properties attributed to soluble factors from macrophages and lymphocytes il 1 was the name given to the macrophage product whereas il 2 was used to define the lymphocyte product at the time of the assignment of these names there was no amino acid sequence analysis known and the terms were used to define biological properties in 1985 two distinct but distantly related complementary dnas encoding proteins sharing human il 1 activity were reported to be isolated from a macrophage cdna library thus defining two individual members of the il 1 family il 1 and il 1 il 1 family is a group of 11 cytokines which induces a complex network of proinflammatory cytokines and via expression of integrins on leukocytes and endothelial cells regulates and initiates inflammatory responses il 1 and il 1 are the most studied members because

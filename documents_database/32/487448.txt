interest was not shown by the mos until spring of 1946 when air ministry specification e 38 46 to undertake studies into the aerodynamic properties of swept wings was issued and a contract awarded in may 1947 for hawker to supply two prototypes a 35 sweep in the wings was the most significant aerodynamic innovation in the p 1052 relative to the p 1040 this feature was developed in conjunction with the rae at farnborough in addition the tailplane was cropped to a shorter span by removing the rounded tips on the p 1040 and was adjustable in incidence to allow changes in trim at the anticipated higher speeds the first prototype vx272 was ready in time for static exhibition at the 1948 s b a c farnborough display but permission was withheld on grounds of secrecy it first flew on 19 november 1948 with the second prototype vx279 flying on 13 april 1949 in late 1949 or early 1950 following tests on a third non flying airframe vx272 had both wings and fuselage strengthened at around the same time vx279 was fitted with a variable incidence tailplane during 1950 vx279 was significantly rebuilt with a single jet outlet and

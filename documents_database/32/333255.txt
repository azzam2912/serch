for example the 1s subshell is filled before the 2s subshell is occupied in this way the electrons of an atom or ion form the most stable electron configuration possible an example is the configuration 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p for the phosphorus atom meaning that the 1s subshell has 2 electrons and so on electron behavior is elaborated by other principles of atomic physics such as hund s rule and the pauli exclusion principle hund s rule asserts that if multiple orbitals of the same energy are available electrons will occupy different orbitals singly before any are occupied doubly if double occupation does occur the pauli exclusion principle requires that electrons which occupy the same orbital must have different spins 1 2 and 1 2 as we pass from one element to another of next higher atomic number one proton and one electron are added each time to the neutral atom the maximum number of electrons in any shell is 2n where n is the principal quantum number the maximum number of electrons in a subshell s p d or f is equal to 2 2 1 where 0 1 2 3 thus these subshells can have a maximum

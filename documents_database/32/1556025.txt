this differs from the more common practice of blending separate wine components into a cuv e after fermentation while co fermentation in principle could be practiced for any mixture of grape varieties it is today more common for red wines produced from a mixture of red grape varieties and a smaller proportion of white grape varieties co fermentation is an old practice going back to the now uncommon practice of having field blends mixed plantations of varieties in vineyards and the previous practice in some regions such as rioja and tuscany of using a small proportion of white grapes to soften some red wines which tended to have harsh tannins when produced with the winemaking methods of the time it is believed that the practice may also have been adopted because it was found empirically to give deeper and better colour to wines which is due to improved co pigmentation resulting from some components in white grapes the only classical old world wine region where co fermentation is still widely practiced is now the c te r tie appellation of northern rh ne while the use of white varieties in red rioja and tuscany wine has more or less disappeared

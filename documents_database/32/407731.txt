compared to fast freight trains drag freight trains have a very low power to weight ratio making them somewhat unpredictable on steep grades or hilly routes this causes many dispatchers to be extremely conservative with how they handle drag freights especially when they share lines with higher priority fast freights and passenger trains before and during wwi and into the 1920s large locomotives such as the 2 8 2 mikado were typically used for drag freight operations after the railroads dieselized heavy duty diesel locomotives typically six axle units to improve adhesion were used for the drag freights multiple unit operations allowed one person to control multiple locomotives as many as 4 11 locomotives may be used for a heavy haul drag freight attempts were made to develop ultra large locomotives for this purpose for example the union pacific dda40x and gas turbine locomotives when ac traction motors and thyristor inverters became available locomotives such as emd sd70mac and the ge ac4400cw replaced the older emd sd40 on a three for two basis in the uk such trains were called mineral trains and the locomotives that hauled them were called mineral locomotives an example of a mineral locomotive was the

as of 2014 he is affiliated with deepmind zisserman received the part iii of the mathematical tripos and his phd in theoretical physics from the sunderland polytechnic in 1984 he started to work in the field of computer vision at the university of edinburgh together with andrew blake they wrote the book visual reconstruction published in 1987 which is considered one of the seminal works in the field of computer vision according to fitzgibbon 2008 this publication was one of the first treatments of the energy minimisation approach to include an algorithm called graduated non convexity designed to directly address the problem of local minima and furthermore to include a theoretical analysis of its convergence in 1987 he moved back to england to the university of oxford where he joined mike brady s newly founded robotics research group as a university research lecturer and started to work on multiple view geometry according to fitzgibbon 2008 his geometry was successful in showing that computer vision could solve problems which humans could not recovering 3d structure from multiple images required highly trained photogrammetrists and took a considerable amount of time however andrew s interests turned to a problem where a six year

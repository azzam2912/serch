the first traditional conjectures originating from alexander grothendieck and introduced in esquisse d un programme were about how topological homomorphisms between two groups of two hyperbolic curves over number fields correspond to maps between the curves these grothendieck conjectures were partially solved by hiroaki nakamura and akio tamagawa while complete proofs were given by shinichi mochizuki before anabelian geometry proper began with the famous letter to gerd faltings and esquisse d un programme the neukirch uchida theorem hinted at the program from the perspective of galois groups which themselves can be shown to be tale fundamental groups more recently mochizuki introduced and developed a so called mono anabelian geometry which restores for a certain class of hyperbolic curves over number fields the curve from its algebraic fundamental group key results of mono anabelian geometry were published in mochizuki s topics in absolute anabelian geometry the anabelian question has been formulated as a concrete example is the case of curves which may be affine as well as projective suppose given a hyperbolic curve c i e the complement of n points in a projective algebraic curve of genus g taken to be smooth and irreducible defined over a field k that

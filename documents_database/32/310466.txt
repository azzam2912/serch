as the unique smallest cubic graph of girth 8 it is a cage and a moore graph it is bipartite and can be constructed as the levi graph of the generalized quadrangle w known as the cremona richmond configuration the graph is named after william thomas tutte and h s m coxeter it was discovered by tutte 1947 but its connection to geometric configurations was investigated by both authors in a pair of jointly published papers tutte 1958 coxeter 1958a all the cubic distance regular graphs are known the tutte coxeter is one of the 13 such graphs it has book thickness 3 and queue number 2 a particularly simple combinatorial construction of the tutte coxeter graph is due to coxeter 1958b based on work by sylvester 1844 in modern terminology take a complete graph on 6 vertices k it has 15 edges and also 15 perfect matchings each vertex of the tutte coxeter graph corresponds to an edge or perfect matching of the k and each edge of the tutte coxeter graph connects a perfect matching of the k to each of its three component edges by symmetry each edge of the k belongs to three perfect matchings incidentally

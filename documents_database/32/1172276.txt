at present the order consists of some 16 families a few of which such as the oncoceratidae brevicoceratidae and acleistoceratidae contain a fair number of genera each while others like the trimeroceratidae and archiacoceratidae are represented by only two or three sweet 1964 the shells of oncocerids are primarily somewhat compressed cyrtoconic brevicones more advanced forms include gyrocones serpenticones toriticones and elongate orthocones and cyrtocones reflective of the different families and genera flower 1950 sweet 1964 the siphuncle in the oncocerida is commonly located at or near the ventral margin connecting rings are most commonly thin and structureless but in certain derived forms may become actinosiphonate with inwardly projecting radial lamellae the juvenile segments in early genera are straight and tubular with short orthochoantic septal necks inherited from the bassleroceratidae later in the mature stages of early forms and throughout in the more advanced the connecting rings are inflated with cyrtochoanitic septal necks giving what can be described as a beaded or ellipsoidal appearance sweet 1964 the oncocerida are thought to be derived from the bassleroceratidae through graciloceras as a result of a thinning of the connecting rings in the siphuncle flower 1976 oncocerids reached their greatest generic diversity in

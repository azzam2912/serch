the synthesis of diphenidine was first reported in 1924 and employed a bruylants reaction analogous to the one that would later be used to discover phencyclidine in 1956 shortly after the 2013 uk ban on arylcyclohexylamines diphenidine and the related compound methoxphenidine became available on the grey market anecdotal reports describe high doses of diphenidine producing bizarre somatosensory phenomena and transient anterograde amnesia diphenidine and related diarylethylamines have been studied in vitro as treatments for neurotoxic injury and are antagonists of the nmda receptor in dogs diphenidine exhibits greater antitussive potency than codeine phosphate electrophysiological analysis demonstrates that the amplitude of nmda mediated fepsps are reduced by diphenidine and ketamine to a similar extent with diphenidine displaying a slower onset of antagonism the two enantiomers of diphenidine differ greatly in their ability to block the nmda receptor with the more potent s enantiomer possessing affinity forty times higher than the r enantiomer since diphenidine s introduction in 2013 vendors have stated the drug acts on dopamine transport yet no data concerning the action of diphenidine on the dopamine transporter was published until 2016 diphenidine s highest affinity is for the nmda receptor but it does display submicromolar affinity for the

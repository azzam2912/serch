the microscope is used in optical mineralogy and petrography a branch of petrology which focuses on detailed descriptions of rocks the method is called polarized light microscopy plm depending on the grade of observation required petrological microscopes are derived from conventional brightfield microscopes of similar basic capabilities by petrographic microscopes are constructed with optical parts that do not add unwanted polarizing effects due to strained glass or polarization by reflection in prisms and mirrors these special parts add to the cost and complexity of the microscope however a simple polarizing microscope is easily made by adding inexpensive polarizing filters to a standard biological microscope often with one in a filter holder beneath the condenser and a second inserted beneath the head or eyepiece these can be sufficient for many non quantitative purposes the two nicol prisms occasionally referred to as nicols of the petrographic microscope have their polarizing planes oriented perpendicular to one another when only an isotropic material such as air water or glass exists between the filters all light is blocked but most crystalline materials and minerals change the polarizing light directions allowing some of the altered light to pass through the analyzer to the viewer using one

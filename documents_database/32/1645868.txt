it has an apparent magnitude of 5 97 9 sgr is a naked eye star lying in the direction of the lagoon nebula messier 8 very close to the central condensation of the hourglass nebula around herschel 36 it was not catalogued by bayer with a greek letter but was listed by flamsteed as number 9 in the constellation sagittarius it lies close to the open cluster ngc 6530 9 sgr is the main source of ionisation for much of the visible nebulosity in the region although the young o star herschel 36 ionises the dense hourglass nebula region 9 sgr itself is surrounded by an ionised h region about 30 light years across including the reflection nebulae ngc 6523 and ngc 6533 this ionised region lies in front of a denser molecular cloud the distances to 9 sgr m8 and ngc 6530 are uncertain but generally estimated to be between 1 200 and 1 800 parsecs recent studies derive a distance around 1 250 pc for the m8 region erosion of the front of the molecular cloud apparently caused by 9 sgr suggests that it lies in front of the cloud but studies of 9 sgr as a binary

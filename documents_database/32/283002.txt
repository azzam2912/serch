it can be considered to be based on the conversion between julian day and the calendar date for the gregorian calendar zeller s congruence is for the julian calendar it is where note in this algorithm january and february are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year e g if it is 2 february 2010 the algorithm counts the date as the second day of the fourteenth month of 2009 02 14 2009 in dd mm yyyy format for an iso week date day of week d 1 monday to 7 sunday use the formulas rely on the mathematician s definition of modulo division which means that 2 mod 7 is equal to positive 5 unfortunately the way most computer languages implement the remainder function 2 mod 7 returns a result of 2 so to implement zeller s congruence on a computer the formulas should be altered slightly to ensure a positive numerator the simplest way to do this is to replace by and by so the formulas become for the gregorian calendar and for the julian calendar one can readily see that in a given year march 1 if that is a saturday then march 2

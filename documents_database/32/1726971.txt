the m channel is important in raising the threshold for firing an action potential it is unique because it is open at rest and even more likely to be open during depolarization furthermore when the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor machr is activated the channel closes the m channel is a pip regulated ion channel kv7 channels have a prominent expression throughout the brain m channels are the reason for slow depolarizations produced by ach and lhrh in the autonomic ganglia and other specified areas 1 initial depolarization of a neuron increases likelihood that m channels will open 2 m channels generate an outward potassium current i 3 potassium efflux counteracts sodium influx in action potential ap overall result full action potential is prevented 1 molecule of acetylcholine ach binds to machr potassium k channels become more likely to be closed neuron becomes tonic firing this reduction in m current is coupled with the actions of the g g protein specifically the hydrolysis of pip to ip this hydrolysis causes pip which is bound to the membrane to become ip and dissociate from the membrane into the cytoplasm when m current is restored it moves back to the membrane there is some

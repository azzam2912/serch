this motion is created through convection which is a form of energy transport involving the physical movement of material a localized magnetic field exerts a force on the plasma effectively increasing the pressure without a comparable gain in density as a result the magnetized region rises relative to the remainder of the plasma until it reaches the star s photosphere this creates starspots on the surface and the related phenomenon of coronal loops the magnetic field of a star can be measured by means of the zeeman effect normally the atoms in a star s atmosphere will absorb certain frequencies of energy in the electromagnetic spectrum producing characteristic dark absorption lines in the spectrum when the atoms are within a magnetic field however these lines become split into multiple closely spaced lines the energy also becomes polarized with an orientation that depends on orientation of the magnetic field thus the strength and direction of the star s magnetic field can be determined by examination of the zeeman effect lines a stellar spectropolarimeter is used to measure the magnetic field of a star this instrument consists of a spectrograph combined with a polarimeter the first instrument to be dedicated to the

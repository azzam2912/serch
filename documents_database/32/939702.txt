most of the plant species found to contain furanocoumarins belong to a handful of plant families the families apiaceae and rutaceae include the largest numbers of plant species that contain furanocoumarins the families moraceae and fabaceae include a few widely distributed plant species that contain furanocoumarins generally furanocoumarins are most abundant in plants that have flowered and in ripe seeds and fruits an exception is the common fig where furanocoumarins are found chiefly in the milky sap of the leaves and shoots but not the fruits during the early stages of plant growth their presence is not easily detected the chemical structure of furanocoumarins consists of a furan ring fused with a coumarin the furan ring may be fused in various ways producing several different isomers the parent compounds of the most common isomers are psoralen and angelicin derivatives of these two compounds are referred to respectively as linear and angular furanocoumarins so called since they exhibit a linear or angular chemical structure the compounds are biosynthesized partly through the phenylpropanoid pathway and the mevalonate pathway which is biosynthesized by a coupling of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate dmapp and 7 hydroxycoumarin umbelliferone many furanocoumarin compounds are toxic the phytochemicals enter the nucleus

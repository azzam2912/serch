it is a white powder with a melting point of lithium titanate is the anode component of the fast recharging lithium titanate battery it is also used as an additive in porcelain enamels and ceramic insulating bodies based on titanates it is frequently utilized as a flux due to its good stability in recent years along with other lithium ceramics metatitanate pebbles have been the subject of research efforts towards tritium breeding materials in nuclear fusion applications the most stable lithium titanate phase is litio that belongs to the monoclinic system a high temperature cubic phase exhibiting solid solution type behavior is referred to as litio and is known to form reversibly above temperatures in the range 1150 1250 c a metastable cubic phase isostructural with litio is referred to as litio it is formed at low temperatures and transforms to the more stable phase at 400 c the sintering process is taking a powder putting it into a mold and heating it to below its melting point sintering is based on atomic diffusion the atoms in the powder particle diffuse into surrounding particles eventually forming a solid or porous material it has been discovered that litio powders have a

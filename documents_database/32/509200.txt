in this context the dielectric constant and hydrogen bonding capacity are the most important properties of the solvent with various solvents there is a different effect on the electronic ground state and excited state of the solute so that the size of energy gap between them changes as the solvent changes this is reflected in the absorption or emission spectrum of the solute as differences in the position intensity and shape of the spectroscopic bands when the spectroscopic band occurs in the visible part of the spectrum solvatochromism is observed as a change of colour this is illustrated by reichardt s dye as shown at the right negative solvatochromism corresponds to a hypsochromic shift or blue shift with increasing solvent polarity an examples of negative solvatochromism is provided by 4 4 hydroxystyryl n methylpyridinium iodide which is red in 1 propanol orange in methanol and yellow in water positive solvatochromism corresponds to a bathochromic shift or red shift with increasing solvent polarity an example of positive solvatochromism is provided by 4 4 bis dimethylamino fuchsone which is orange in toluene red in acetone the main value of the concept of solvatochromism is the context it provides to predict colors of

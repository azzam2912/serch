naro kslv ii is under development by kari korea aerospace research institute and is planned to have its first flight in february 2021 all three stages are planned to use indigenously developed rocket engines the south korean government is setting spacex as a role model striving to develop relatively cheap and reliable rockets competitive enough for the commercial launch market currently the goal is to launch a 1 500 kg payload into a 600 800 km low earth orbit leo and 2 600 kg into a 300 km leo kslv ii is a three stage rocket the first stage booster uses four kre 075 sl engines generating 266 4t of thrust with a specific impulse of 289 1s the second stage booster uses a single kre 075 vac engine which has a wider nozzle for increased efficiency in vacuum with a specific impulse of 315 4s the third stage booster uses one kre 007 engine with a specific impulse of 325 1s both 75 ton and 7 ton models use jet a 1 as fuel and liquid oxygen lox as oxidizer further improvements will be added after the success of kslv ii program mainly increasing the thrust 75 9 tf

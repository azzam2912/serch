it is analogous to the twinkling one sees looking at stars in the sky at night but in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum rather than the visible one interplanetary scintillation is the result of radio waves traveling through fluctuations in the density of the electron and protons that make up the solar wind scintillation in radio waves due to the ionosphere was observed as early as 1951 by antony hewish and he then reported irregularities in radiation received during an observation of a bright radio source in taurus in 1954 hewish considered various possibilities and suggested that irregularities in the solar corona would cause scattering by refraction and could produce the irregularities he observed a decade later while making astrometric observations of several bright sources of celestial radio waves using a radio interferometer hewish and two collaborators reported unusual fluctuations of intensity in a few of the sources the data strongly supported the notion that the fluctuations resulted from irregularities in the density of the plasma associated with the solar wind which the authors called interplanetary scintillation and is recognized as the discovery of the interplanetary scintillation phenomenon in order to study interplanetary scintillation hewish built the interplanetary

it is distinguished by a very small genome that has been fully sequenced because of its use as a model species and is in widespread use as a reference in genomics the species is often referred to in the genomics literature as fugu rubripes the genus fugu is a synonym of the currently preferred takifugu takifugu is japanese for puffer and rubripes comes from the latin ruber and p s meaning ruddy foot the species is known from the sea of japan east china sea and yellow sea north to southern sakhalin at depths of it is a demersal species spawning occurs in estuaries young fish can tolerate a wide range of salinities and will remain in river mouths and lagoons maturing for one year before migrating permanently to the open ocean a feature of this species is that it has a very small genome which is used as a reference for identifying genes and other elements in human and other vertebrate genomes the genome was published in 2002 by the international fugu genome consortium via whole genome shotgun sequencing after being initiated in 1989 it was the first vertebrate genome after the human genome to be made publicly available

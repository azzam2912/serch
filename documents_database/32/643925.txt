maughmer born january 18 1950 is a professor of aerospace engineering in the department of aerospace engineering at the pennsylvania state university he is a widely published author known throughout the world as one of the leading aerodynamicists especially in the areas of airfoil and winglet design and analysis wing optimization natural laminar flow aerodynamics and subsonic low turbulence wind tunnel design and operation in 1987 peter masak called on maughmer about designing winglets for his sailplane to improve performance others had attempted to apply richard t whitcomb s nasa winglets to gliders and though they did improve climb performance this did not offset the parasite drag penalty in high speed cruise masak was convinced it was possible to overcome this hurdle and maughmer was willing to join his quest by trial and error they ultimately developed successful winglet designs for gliding competitions and at the 1991 world gliding championships in uvalde texas the trophy for the highest speed went to a winglet equipped 15 meter class limited wingspan glider exceeding the highest speed in the unlimited span open class an exceptional result the winglets were originally retrofit to production sailplanes but now most high performance gliders are equipped from

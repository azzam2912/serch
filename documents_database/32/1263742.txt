it is primarily focused on building and validation of atomic models into three dimensional electron density maps obtained by x ray crystallography methods although it has also been applied to data from electron microscopy coot displays electron density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization real space refinement manual rotation translation rigid body fitting ligand search solvation mutations rotamers and ramachandran idealization the software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are discoverable through familiar user interface elements menus and toolbars or by intuitive behaviour mouse controls recent developments have enhanced the usability of the software for expert users with customisable key bindings extensions and an extensive scripting interface coot is free software distributed under the gnu gpl it is available from the coot web site originally at the university of york and now at the mrc laboratory of molecular biology pre compiled binaries are also available for linux and windows from the web page and ccp4 and for mac os x through fink and ccp4 additional support is available through the coot wiki and an active coot mailing list the primary author is paul

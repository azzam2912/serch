it is a neurotoxin that acts by interfering with oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by inhibiting complex i leading to the depletion of atp and eventual cell death mpp arises in the body as the toxic metabolite of the closely related compound mptp mptp is converted in the brain into mpp by the enzyme mao b ultimately causing parkinsonism in primates by killing certain dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra the ability for mpp to induce parkinson s disease has made it an important compound in parkinson s research since this property was discovered in 1983 the chloride salt of mpp found use in the 1970s as an herbicide under the trade name cyperquat though no longer in use as an herbicide cyperquat s closely related structural analog paraquat still finds widespread usage raising some safety concerns mpp has been known since at least the 1920s with a synthesis of the compound being published in a german chemistry journal in 1923 its neurotoxic effects however were not known until much later with the first paper definitively identifying mpp as a parkinson s inducing poison being published in 1983 this paper followed a string of poisonings that took place in san

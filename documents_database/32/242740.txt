while hideyoshi was on his deathbed his son toyotomi hideyori was still only 5 years old and as such hideyoshi needed to create the council in order to ensure his heir would be able to succeed him after coming of age they also acted as advisers for the five commissioners japanese go bugy which had also been established by hideyoshi to govern kyoto and the surrounding areas hideyoshi had been slowly changing in demeanor as the invasions of korea in attempt to conquer both korea and china were failing hideyoshi himself had not joined the korean campaigns and assigned vassals in his command to head the campaign he sent his final force of 140 000 to korea in 1597 but the efforts were fruitless hideyoshi s execution of family members were also one of the reasons for questioning his sanity during this period before the birth of his son hideyori he had adopted his nephew toyotomi hidetsugu to be his heir in 1591 because hidetsugu had helped hideyoshi in his campaigns once hideyori was born he ordered toyotomi hidetsugu to commit ritual suicide on mount k ya this causing hideyoshi s only possible heir to be his infant son hideyori

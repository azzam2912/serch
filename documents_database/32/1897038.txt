it is a local government funding agency owned by the dutch water boards and provinces it has been using the trading name nwb bank since 2009 although a registered bank it only lends to dutch government entities and does not provide any services to individuals or companies starting in the 1950s the water board union regularly lent money to the individual water boards however the union was not well equipped to handle the banking and lending activities and so on december 19 1952 it decided to set up a separate water board bank to handle this task the bank would raise risk less capital from the water boards and later other government organisations and lend this out to the water boards as required the main aim was to provide the cheapest possible source of funding for the government entities the disaster caused by the north sea flood of 1953 sped up the development of the bank and on may 5 1954 the bank was established as limited company by the 142 water boards of the netherlands the bank is wholly owned by a diverse set of dutch government entities and only the dutch state and local entities may be shareholders

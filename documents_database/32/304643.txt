the conduit contains two t section steel power rails of opposite polarity facing each other about apart and about below the street surface power reached the car by means of an attachment called a plough us plow that rode in the conduit beneath the car the plough had two metal shoes attached to springs that pushed sideways against the power rails the plough was normally connected to a platform that could slide laterally to conform with variations in the placement of the conduit for example in some areas there was a conduit for cable cars adjacent to the one for electric cars the current was carried by a flexible cable from the plough through the platform to the car s controller and motor s the running rails are not part of the electrical circuit in the united states the cars were sometimes popularly but incorrectly called trolleys but did not typically draw power through a trolley pole from an overhead wire as strictly defined trolley cars do conduit current collection was one of the first ways of supplying power to trams but it proved to be much more expensive complicated and trouble prone than overhead wires when electric street railways

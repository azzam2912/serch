it usually provides a plot of deformation vs compressive force it is commonly used to evaluate shipping containers made of corrugated fiberboard as well as wooden boxes and crates industrial and consumer packages other than boxes can also be subjected to compression testing drum pail bottle tub etc package components are also evaluated for compression resistance it is usually a laboratory test involving a special machine a compression tester to apply controlled compression on a test specimen a universal testing machine is sometimes configured to perform a package compression test compression testing can also involve a superimposed dead load to a test package a common method of conducting the test as described in several published standard test methods is to compress a box at a constant rate of 1 2 inch 12 5 mm per minute between two rigid platens the platens can be fixed so that they remain parallel or one can be pivoted or floating the test can be conducted on empty or filled boxes with or without a box closure conditioning to standard temperature and humidity is important the results of the constant rate of compression test can be the dynamic loads have some relationship with expected

this is a variation on the term jbod just a bunch of disks that is used to describe standard hard drives that are used in a storage array many computer files have a defined structure such as fixed length records with the data divided into records that are the same length structured data might have records of different lengths but each record is prefixed with a rdw record descriptor word that indicates the length of that data as well as other attributes jbob data has no structure records are defined by the presence of characters in the data for example a report might have hundreds of records or lines but the length of each record is defined by the presence of a carriage return and or line feed mainframe computers have traditionally dealt with structured data but unstructured jbob data is much more common in pc environments the critical difference is that it is difficult if not impossible to advance to say the 100th record without examining every character of the 99 records that precede it with fixed length records it is possible to calculate the exact position of a particular record even with variable length records the length of

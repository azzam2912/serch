proper procedure will ensure project safety tank integrity and the best utilization of resources and materials a complete engineering analysis should be performed to ensure that tank components will not be overstressed during lifting and remedial operations a professional engineer will develop project specific drawings and procedures and will supervise each stage of the work an analysis of the situation will result in recommendations for the appropriate remedial action and what repair work should be performed possibly including but not limited to storage tanks should be updated to meet the highest local environmental standards including the installation of release prevention barriers and leak detection several different technologies exist for lifting tanks the conventional methods involve hydraulic jacking equipment while another method utilizes an airbag lifting system to elevate the tank from its base to allow for remedial action some companies choose to relocate existing tanks rather than embark on new tank construction tank relocation services can be utilized on land or via navigable waterways there can be cost benefits to relocating an existing tank depending on variables such as distance and the condition of the tank

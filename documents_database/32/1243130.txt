the pure compound is pale yellow but commercial samples are often colored it is barely soluble in water and is often supplied as a wet paste it is widely used in the production of diarylide yellow pigments used in the production of printing inks its use in the production of dyes has been largely discontinued because of concerns about carcinogenicity 3 3 dichlorobenzidine is prepared in two steps from 2 nitrochlorobenzene the first step involves reduction with zinc in base to afford 3 3 dichlorodiphenylhydrazine this intermediate undergoes the benzidine rearrangement to afford 3 3 dichlorobenzidine aqueous solutions of 3 3 dichlorobenzidine degrade in light to monochloro derivative it undergoes chlorination for example in water treatment plants to give the tetrachloro derivative the most widely practiced reaction of 3 3 dichlorobenzidine is its double diazotization this bis diazo intermediate is then coupled to derivatives of acetoacetylaminobenzene chc o chc o nhar in this way the following commercial yellow pigments are produced pigment yellow 12 pigment yellow 13 pigment yellow 14 pigment yellow 17 and pigment yellow 83 3 3 dichlorobenzidine is considered a carcinogen this compound has been shown to increase the incidence of tumors in animals because it is

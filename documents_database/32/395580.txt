it is a cyclic secondary amine also classified as a saturated heterocycle it is a colourless liquid that is miscible with water and most organic solvents it has a characteristic odor that has been described as ammoniacal fishy shellfish like in addition to pyrrolidine itself many substituted pyrrolidines are known pyrrolidine is prepared industrially by the reaction of 1 4 butanediol and ammonia at a temperature of 165 200 c and a pressure of 17 21 mpa in the presence of a cobalt and nickel oxide catalyst which is supported on alumina the reaction is carried out in the liquid phase in a continuous tube or tube bundle reactor which is operated in the cycle gas method the catalyst is arranged as a fixed bed and the conversion is carried out in the downflow mode the product is obtained after multistage purification and separation by extractive and azeotropic distillation many modifications of pyrrolidine are found in natural and synthetic chemistry the pyrrolidine ring structure is present in numerous natural alkaloids such as nicotine and hygrine it is found in many drugs such as procyclidine and bepridil it also forms the basis for the racetam compounds e g piracetam aniracetam the

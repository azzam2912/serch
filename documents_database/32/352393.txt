the interaction between the host and guest involves purely van der waals bonding the definition of inclusion compounds is very broad extending to channels formed between molecules in a crystal lattice in which guest molecules can fit calixarenes and related formaldehyde arene condensates are one class of hosts that form inclusion compounds one famous illustration is the adduct with cyclobutadiene which otherwise is unstable cyclodextrins are well established hosts for the formation of inclusion compounds illustrative is the case of ferrocene which is inserted into the cyclodextrin at 100 c under hydrothermal conditions cyclodextrin also forms inclusion compounds with fragrances as a result the fragrance molecules have a reduced vapor pressure and are more stable towards exposure to light and air when incorporated into textiles the fragrance lasts much longer due to the slow release action cryptands and crown ethers typically do not form inclusion complexes since the guest is bound by forces stronger than van der waals bonding if the guest is enclosed on all sides so that it is trapped the compound is known as a clathrate not an inclusion complex in molecular encapsulation a guest molecule is trapped inside another molecule

below in order to remove residual stresses and improve wear resistance on steels and even composites in addition to seeking enhanced stress relief and stabilization or wear resistance cryogenic treatment is also sought for its ability to improve corrosion resistance by precipitating micro fine eta carbides which can be measured before and after in a part using a quantimet the process has a wide range of applications from industrial tooling to the improvement of musical signal transmission some of the benefits of cryogenic treatment include longer part life less failure due to cracking improved thermal properties better electrical properties including less electrical resistance reduced coefficient of friction less creep and walk improved flatness and easier machining cryogenic hardening is a cryogenic treatment process where the material is slowly cooled to very low temperatures by using liquid nitrogen the temperature can go as low as 196 c it can have a profound effect on the mechanical properties of certain materials such as steels or tungsten carbide in tungsten carbide wc co the crystal structure of cobalt is transformed from softer fcc to harder hcp phase whereas the hard tungsten carbide particle is unaffected by the treatment cryogenic machining is a machining

a more complex measurement encephalization quotient takes into account allometric effects of widely divergent body sizes across several taxa the raw brain to body mass ratio is however simpler to come by and is still a useful tool for comparing encephalization within species or between fairly closely related species brain size usually increases with body size in animals i e large animals usually have larger brains than smaller animals the relationship is not however linear small mammals such as mice may have a brain body ratio similar to humans while elephants have a comparatively lower brain body ratio in animals it is thought that the larger the brain the more brain weight will be available for more complex cognitive tasks however large animals need more neurons to represent their own bodies and control specific muscles thus relative rather than absolute brain size makes for a ranking of animals that better coincides with the observed complexity of animal behaviour the relationship between brain to body mass ratio and complexity of behaviour is not perfect as other factors also influence intelligence like the evolution of the recent cerebral cortex and different degrees of brain folding which increase the surface of the cortex

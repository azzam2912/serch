just as every lie group has a lie algebra every lie groupoid has a lie algebroid beside isomorphism of groupoids there is a more coarse notation of equivalence the so called morita equivalence a quite general example is the morita morphism of the ech groupoid which goes as follows let m be a smooth manifold and formula 13 an open cover of m define formula 14 the disjoint union with the obvious submersion formula 15 in order to encode the structure of the manifold m define the set of morphisms formula 16 where formula 17 the source and target map are defined as the embeddings formula 18 and formula 19 and multiplication is the obvious one if we read the formula 20 as subsets of m compatible points in formula 20 and formula 22 actually are the same in m and also lie in formula 23 this ech groupoid is in fact the pullback groupoid of formula 24 i e the trivial groupoid over m under p that is what makes it morita morphism in order to get the notion of an equivalence relation we need to make the construction symmetric and show that it is also transitive in this

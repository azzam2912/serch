making an aircraft design larger can also improve the overall fuel efficiency and man hours for transporting a given load while a greater space is available for transporting lightweight cargoes or giving passengers room to move around however as aircraft increase in size they pose significant design issues not present in smaller types these include structural efficiency flight control response and sufficient power in a reliable and cost effective installation large aircraft also require specialised ground facilities and some countries have special regulatory environments for them the giant airships of the 1930s remain as of 2016 the largest aircraft ever constructed while the hughes h 4 spruce goose of 1947 had the largest wingspan of any fixed wing type the hybrid air vehicles airlander 10 hybrid airship is the largest aircraft flying today the lifting capacity of an aircraft depends on the wing size and its loading the weight per unit area that the wing can support loading is more or less constant for a given level of technology thus as aircraft size increases the lifting capacity increases with the surface area for a given aerodynamic form the area in turn increases with the square of the wing span if

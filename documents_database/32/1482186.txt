sometimes it is used in cryptography instead of the weierstrass form because it can provide a defence against simple and differential power analysis style spa attacks it is possible indeed to use the general addition formula also for doubling a point on an elliptic curve of this form in this way the two operations become indistinguishable from some side channel information the jacobi curve offers also faster arithmetic compared to the weierstrass curve the jacobi curve can be of two types the jacobi intersection that is given by an intersection of two surfaces and the jacobi quartic given an elliptic curve it is possible to do some operations between its points for example one can add two points p and q obtaining the point p q that belongs to the curve given a point p on the elliptic curve it is possible to double p that means find 2 p p p the square brackets are used to indicate n p the point p added n times and also find the negation of p that means find p in this way the points of an elliptic curve forms a group note that the identity element of the group operation is

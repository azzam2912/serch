a dead weight tester dwt is a calibration standard method that uses a piston cylinder on which a load is placed to make an equilibrium with an applied pressure underneath the piston deadweight testers are so called primary standards which means that the pressure measured by a deadweight tester is defined through other quantities length mass and time typically deadweight testers are used in calibration laboratories to calibrate pressure transfer standards like electronic pressure measuring devices the formula on which the design of a dwt is based basically is expressed as follows where to be able to do accurate measurements this formula has to be refined in general there are three different kind of dwt s divided by the medium which is measured and the lubricant which is used for its measuring element all three systems have their own specific operational demands some points of attention make sure that the pcu is clean this is a very important issue as the pcu s operation is sensitive to contamination also when connecting a dut make sure that the dut does not introduce contamination in the measuring system lubricant of the pcu leaks in the gas circuit of the dwt for this

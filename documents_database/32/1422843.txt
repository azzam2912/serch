the ipk and its duplicates remain secondary standards for the kilogram and are used to calibrate all other kilogram mass standards on earth the ipk is a roughly golfball sized object made of a platinum alloy known as pt10ir which is 90 platinum and 10 iridium by mass and is machined into a right circular cylinder with height equal to its diameter of about 39millimetres to reduce its surface area the addition of 10 iridium improved upon the all platinum kilogramme des archives by greatly increasing hardness while still retaining platinum s many virtues extreme resistance to oxidation extremely high density almost twice as dense as lead and more than 21 times as dense as water satisfactory electrical and thermal conductivities and low magnetic susceptibility the ipk and its six sister copies are stored at the international bureau of weights and measures known by its french language initials bipm in an environmentally monitored safe in the lower vault located in the basement of the bipm s pavillon de breteuil in saint cloud on the outskirts of paris see external images below for photographs three independently controlled keys are required to open the vault official copies of the ipk were made

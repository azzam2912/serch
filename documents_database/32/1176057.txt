the mobile studio ioboard is a small inexpensive hardware platform for use in a home classroom or remote environment when coupled with the mobile studio desktop software the system duplicates a large amount of the hardware often used to teach electrical engineering computer engineering control systems and physics courses among others with the support of several technology companies adi hp and maxim and the national science foundation the mobile studio project is now being utilized to enhance science math engineering and technology education around the world the project s goal is to enable hands on exploration of science and engineering principles devices and systems that have historically been restricted to expensive laboratory facilities in 1999 rensselaer polytechnic institute professor don millard started thinking about a way to enable students to perform experiments whenever and wherever they desire experiments that use an oscilloscope function generator digital control and some form of power supply the project started by looking at commercially available solutions which were found to be prohibitively expensive since the desire was to keep the cost of the solution similar to the price of an engineering textbook the academy of electronic media mobile studio project s inspiration was drawn from

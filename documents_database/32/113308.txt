a spherically symmetric black hole which are adapted to radial null geodesics null geodesics are the worldlines of photons radial ones are those that are moving directly towards or away from the central mass they are named for arthur stanley eddington and david finkelstein although they appear to have inspired the idea neither ever wrote down these coordinates or the metric in these coordinates roger penrose seems to have been the first to write down the null form but credits it to the above paper by finkelstein and in his adams prize essay later that year to eddington and finkelstein most influentially misner thorne and wheeler in their book gravitation refer to the null coordinates by that name in these coordinate systems outward inward traveling radial light rays which each follow a null geodesic define the surfaces of constant time while the radial coordinate is the usual area coordinate so that the surfaces of rotation symmetry have an area of one advantage of this coordinate system is that it shows that the apparent singularity at the schwarzschild radius is only a coordinate singularity and is not a true physical singularity while this fact was recognized by finkelstein it was not

this branch of pharmacodynamics relates concentration of an anti infective agent to effect but specifically to its antimicrobial effect the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration are used to measure in vitro activity antimicrobial and is an excellent indicator of antimicrobial potency they don t give any information relating to time dependent antimicrobial killing the so called post antibiotic effect the post antibiotic effect pae is defined as persistent suppression of bacterial growth after a brief exposure 1 or 2 hours of bacteria to an antibiotic even in the absence of host defense mechanisms factors that affect the duration of the post antibiotic effect include duration of antibiotic exposure bacterial species culture medium and class of antibiotic it has been suggested that an alteration of dna function is possibly responsible for post antibiotic effect following the observation that most inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis aminoglycosides fluoroquinolones tetracyclines clindamycin certain newer macrolides ketolides and rifampicin and rifabutin induce long term pae against susceptible bacteria theoretically the ability of an antibiotic to induce a pae is an attractive property of an antibiotic since antibiotic concentrations could fall below the mic for the bacterium yet retain their effectiveness in their

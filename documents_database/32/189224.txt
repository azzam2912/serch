igf 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the igf1 gene igf 1 consists of 70 amino acids in a single chain with three intramolecular disulfide bridges igf 1 has a molecular weight of 7 649 daltons igf 1 is produced primarily by the liver production is stimulated by growth hormone gh most of igf 1 is bound to one of 6 binding proteins igf bp igfbp 1 is regulated by insulin igf 1 is produced throughout life the highest rates of igf 1 production occur during the pubertal growth spurt the lowest levels occur in infancy and old age protein intake increases igf 1 levels in humans under age 65 independent of total calorie consumption a synthetic analog of igf 1 mecasermin is used in children for the treatment of growth failure igf 1 is produced primarily by the liver as an endocrine hormone as well as in target tissues in a paracrine autocrine fashion production is stimulated by growth hormone gh and can be retarded by undernutrition growth hormone insensitivity lack of growth hormone receptors or failures of the downstream signaling pathway post gh receptor including shp2 and stat5b approximately 98 of igf 1 is

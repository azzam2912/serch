as is typical of g protein coupled receptors the cannabinoid receptors contain seven transmembrane spanning domains cannabinoid receptors are activated by three major groups of ligands endocannabinoids produced by the mammillary body plant cannabinoids such as cannabidiol produced by the cannabis plant and synthetic cannabinoids such as hu 210 all of the endocannabinoids and phytocannabinoids plant based cannabinoids are lipophilic such as fat soluble compounds there are currently two known subtypes of cannabinoid receptors termed cb and cb the cb receptor is expressed mainly in the brain central nervous system or cns but also in the lungs liver and kidneys the cb receptor is expressed mainly in the immune system and in hematopoietic cells mounting evidence suggests that there are novel cannabinoid receptors that is non cb and non cb which are expressed in endothelial cells and in the cns in 2007 the binding of several cannabinoids to the g protein coupled receptor gpr55 in the brain was described the protein sequences of cb and cb receptors are about 44 similar when only the transmembrane regions of the receptors are considered amino acid similarity between the two receptor subtypes is approximately 68 in addition minor variations in each receptor have

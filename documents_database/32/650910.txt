pbc causes scarring of liver tissue confined primarily to the bile duct drainage system ama is present in about 95 of cases pbc is seen primarily in middle aged women and in those afflicted with other autoimmune diseases several of the antigens associated with anti mitochondrial antibodies have been identified antibodies to these specific antigens have been associated with a number of conditions anti m2 m4 m8 and m9 are associated with primary bilary cirrhosis m2 autoimmune hepatitis m1 syphilis m3 drug induced lupus erythematosus m6 drug induced hepatitis m7 cardiomyopathy myocarditis m5 systemic lupus erythematosus and undifferentiated collagenosis autoimmune haemolytic anaemia these associations are not completely specific and should not be relied upon solely for diagnosis antimitochondrial antibodies can also be detected in sj gren s syndrome systemic sclerosis asymptomatic recurrent bacteriuria in women pulmonary tuberculosis and leprosy anti cardiolipin antibodies are another type of ama and cardiolipin is found on the inner mitochondrial membrane a cause of ama has been postulated to be that xenobiotic induced and or oxidative modification of mitochondrial autoantigens is a critical step leading to loss of tolerance in acute liver failure ama are found against all major liver antigens around 40 of acute

this multidisciplinary field provides a foundation for understanding a wide variety of astrophysical observations and understanding and ultimately controlling the fusion regime specifically thermonuclear ignition by inertial confinement in the laboratory as well as the transition from planets to brown dwarfs and stars in nature takes place via the hed regime a wide variety of new and emerging experimental capabilities national ignition facility nif jupiter laser facility jlf etc together with the push towards exascale computing help make this new scientific frontier rich with discovery the hed domain is often defined by an energy density units of pressure above 1 mbar 100 gpa 1 million of atmosphere this is comparable to the energy density of a chemical bond such as in a water molecule thus at 1 mbar chemistry as we know it changes experiments at nif now routinely probe matter at 100 mbar at these atomic pressure conditions the energy density is comparable to that of the inner core electrons so the atoms themselves change the dense hed regime includes highly degenerate matter with interatomic spacing less than the de broglie wavelength this is similar to quantum regime achieved at low temperatures e g bose einstein condensation however unlike

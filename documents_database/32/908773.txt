maintaining avascularity of the corneal stroma is an important aspect of corneal pathophysiology as it is required for corneal transparency and optimal vision a decrease in corneal transparency causes visual acuity deterioration corneal tissue is avascular in nature and the presence of vascularization which can be deep or superficial is always pathologically related corneal neovascularization is a sight threatening condition that can be caused by inflammation related to infection chemical injury autoimmune conditions post corneal transplantation and traumatic conditions among other ocular pathologies common causes of cnv within the cornea include trachoma corneal ulcers phylctenular keratoconjunctivitis rosacea keratitis interstitial keratitis sclerosing keratitis chemical burns and wearing contact lenses for over extended periods of time superficial presentations of cnv are usually associated with contact lens wear while deep presentations may be caused by chronic inflammatory and anterior segment ocular diseases corneal neovascularization is becoming increasingly common worldwide with an estimated incidence rate of 1 4 million cases per year according to a 1998 study by the massachusetts eye and ear infirmary the same study found that the tissue from twenty percent of corneas examined during corneal transplantations had some degree of neovascularization negatively impacting the prognosis for individuals undergoing keratoplasty procedures

it was discovered by john herschel on november 29 1837 it is at the distance of 59 milion light years the galaxy may forms a pair with another nearby galaxy ngc 1375 but it is uncertain based on estimated distance of ngc 1375 it is a member of fornax cluster a cluster of 200 galaxies and it is positioned near the center of cluster and central galaxy ngc 1399 while closest galaxy after ngc 1375 outside the pair is ngc 1373 ngc 1374 s size on night sky is 2 7 x 2 4 which with galaxy s distance gives diameter of 50 000 light years ngc 1374 is an early type galaxy with a hubble classification of e1 indicating a flattening of 10 but also it shows a subtle differetantion of light about halfway out of radius which is indicating transition to s0 classification it has a bright core surrounded by a soft hazy halo despite their name early type galaxies are much older than spiral galaxies and mostly comprise old red colored stars very little star formation occurs in these galaxies the lack of star formation in elliptical galaxies appears to start at the center and then slowly

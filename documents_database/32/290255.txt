it uses two guyed steel tube masts as aerials and one guyed steel framework mast which are insulated against ground it has two transmission aerials for shortwave and one free standing steel framework tower for directional radio services the shortwave transmitter was shut off on october 19 2004 at time of inauguration in 1930 the transmitter which had a power of 60 kw used a t type antenna spun between two 100 m high wooden lattice towers placed 310 m apart as this antenna produced large amounts of skywave the area of undistorted fading free reception was in spite of its high transmission power at night not as large as planned and so it was planned to replace this antenna by an aerial with better skywave suppression so in 1933 34 a 190 m high wooden tower the tallest structure ever built of wood was built in which a vertical wire antenna which was electrically enlengthened by a metal ring with 10 6 metres diameters on the top of the tower was hung up at this time transmission power was also increased from 60 kw to 100 kw after inauguration of this antenna the two original wooden towers were dismantled

the divalent organic ligand coordinated to the metal center is called a carbene carbene complexes for almost all transition metals have been reported many methods for synthesizing them and reactions utilizing them have been reported the term carbene ligand is a formalism since many are not derived from carbenes and almost none exhibit the reactivity characteristic of carbenes described often as m cr they represent a class of organic ligands intermediate between alkyls cr and carbynes cr they feature in some catalytic reactions especially alkene metathesis and are of value in the preparation of some fine chemicals metal carbene complexes are often classified into two types the fischer carbenes named after ernst otto fischer feature strong acceptors at the metal and being electrophilic at the carbene carbon atom schrock carbenes named after richard r schrock are characterized by more nucleophilic carbene carbon centers these species typically feature higher valent metals n heterocyclic carbenes nhcs were popularlized following arduengo s isolation of a stable free carbene in 1991 reflecting the growth of the area carbene complexes are now known with a broad range of different reactivities and diverse substituents often it is not possible to classify a carbene complex with regards

while the models within a class may differ dramatically at finite scales their behavior will become increasingly similar as the limit scale is approached in particular asymptotic phenomena such as critical exponents will be the same for all models in the class some well studied universality classes are the ones containing the ising model or the percolation theory at their respective phase transition points these are both families of classes one for each lattice dimension typically a family of universality classes will have a lower and upper critical dimension below the lower critical dimension the universality class becomes degenerate this dimension is 2d for the ising model or for directed percolation but 1d for undirected percolation and above the upper critical dimension the critical exponents stabilize and can be calculated by an analog of mean field theory this dimension is 4d for ising or for directed percolation and 6d for undirected percolation critical exponents are defined in terms of the variation of certain physical properties of the system near its phase transition point these physical properties will include its reduced temperature formula 1 its order parameter measuring how much of the system is in the ordered phase the specific heat

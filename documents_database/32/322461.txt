in american english the term is synonymous with drawbridge and the latter is the common term but drawbridge can be limited to the narrower historical definition used in some other forms of english in which drawbridge refers only to a specific type of moveable bridge an advantage of making bridges moveable is the lower cost due to the absence of high piers and long approaches the principal disadvantage is that the traffic on the bridge must be halted when it is opened for passage of traffic on the waterway for seldom used railroad bridges over busy channels the bridge may be left open and then closed for train passages for small bridges bridge movement may be enabled without the need for an engine some bridges are operated by the users especially those with a boat others by a bridgeman or bridge tender a few are remotely controlled using video cameras and loudspeakers generally the bridges are powered by electric motors whether operating winches gearing or hydraulic pistons while moveable bridges in their entirety may be quite long the length of the moveable portion is restricted by engineering and cost considerations to a few hundred feet there are often traffic lights

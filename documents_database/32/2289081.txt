in particular this includes the coulomb law observed in electrostatics and riesz potentials extensively studied in potential theory for formula 3 such particles an equilibrium stable state which depends on the parameter formula 2 is attained when the associated energy of the system is minimal the so called generalized thomson problem for large numbers of points these equilibrium configurations provide a discretization of formula 1 which may or may not be nearly uniform with respect to the surface area or volume of formula 1 the poppy seed bagel theorem asserts that for a large class of sets formula 1 the uniformity property holds when the parameter formula 2 is larger than or equal to the dimension of the set formula 1 for example when the points poppy seeds are confined to a torus embedded in 3 dimensions or surface of a bagel one can create a large number of points that are nearly uniformly spread on the surface by imposing a repulsion proportional to the inverse square distance between the points or any stronger repulsion formula 10 from a culinary perspective to create the nearly perfect poppy seed bagel where bites of equal size anywhere on the bagel would contain

this helps determine the shape and make up of ancient supercontinents and provides a basis for paleogeographic reconstructions an important part of reconstructing past plate configurations is to define the edges of areas of the lithosphere that have acted independently at some time in the past most present plate boundaries are easily identifiable from the pattern of recent seismicity this is now backed up by the use of gps data to confirm the presence of significant relative movement between plates identifying past but now inactive plate boundaries within current plates is generally based on evidence for an ocean that has now closed up the line where the ocean used to be is normally marked by pieces of the crust from that ocean included in the collision zone known as ophiolites the line across which two plates became joined to form a single larger plate is known as a suture in many orogenic belts the collision is not just between two plates but involves the sequential accretion of smaller terranes terranes are smaller pieces of continental crust that have been caught up in an orogeny such as continental fragments or island arcs plate motions both those observable now and in the

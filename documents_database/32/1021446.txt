the major advantage of this technology is that in many plant species plastid dna is not transmitted through pollen which prevents gene flow from the genetically modified plant to other plants the most common method to transform plastids is particle bombardment small gold or tungsten particles are coated with dna and shot into young plant cells or plant embryos some genetic material will stay in the cells and transform them the transformation efficiency is lower than in agrobacterial mediated transformation which is also common in plant genetic engineering but particle bombardment is especially suitable for plastid transformation in order to persist and be stably maintained in the cell a plasmid dna molecule must contain an origin of replication which allows it to be replicated in the cell independently of the chromosome because transformation usually produces a mixture of rare transformed cells and abundant non transformed cells a method is needed to identify the cells that have acquired the plasmid plasmids used in transformation experiments will usually also contain a gene giving resistance to an antibiotic or more recently developed resistance against a herbicide that the intended recipient strain of bacteria is sensitive to selection for cells able to grow on

these functions are host defense classically activated macrophages wound healing alternatively activated wound healing macrophages and immune regulation mregs physiological role of mregs is to dampen the immune response and limit immunopathology unlike classically activated macrophages mregs produce high levels of anti inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 il 10 and turn off il 12 synthesis and unlike wound healing macrophages mregs do not induct arginase so they do not contribute to the production of the extracellular matrix mregs can arise following innate or adaptive immune responses mreg population was firstly described after fc r ligation by igg complexes in occurrence of pathogen associated molecular patterns e g lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid acting through toll like receptors this stimulation specifically decreased il 12 production and increased il 10 production coculture of macrophages with regulatory t cells tregs caused differentiation of macrophages toward mreg phenotype similar effect provoked interaction of macrophages and b 1 b cells mregs can even arise following stress responses activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis leads to production of glucocorticoids that cause decreased production of il 12 by macrophages there are many different ways to prepare or generate mregs but there is necessary a combination of two stimuli

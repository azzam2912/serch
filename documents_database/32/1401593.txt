2012 strict taxonomy only considers common traits possessed by all organisms of the group some organisms within each of the component groups of myzozoa have lost the ability for myzocytosis further as taxonomy pays no account of molecular phylogeny one current classification has all alveolate taxa other than apicomplexans ciliates and dinoflagellates named under the grab bag term protalveolata the difficulty of placing very early dinozoans either within or outside the group dinoflagellates continues to favour classifications such as protalveolata as does the potential polyphyly between the two genera of colpodellids voromonas and colpodella the most closely related large clade to the myzozoans are the ciliates both of these groups of organisms unlike the majority of eukaryotes studied to date seem to have a linear mitochondrial genome most other eukaryotes that have had their mitochondrial genomes examined have circular genomes however the taxonomic term myzozoa specifically excludes ciliates which are rather under the higher taxonomic rank alveolata thus alveoata includes two large groups myzozoa and ciliophora plus the smaller groups discussed above all myzozoa appears to have evolved form an ancestor that possessed plastids required through endosymbiosis the branching order within both myzozoa and protalveolata is only partly understood three

it involves producing images that communicate relationships among the represented data to viewers of the images this communication is achieved through the use of a systematic mapping between graphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization this mapping establishes how data values will be represented visually determining how and to what extent a property of a graphic mark such as size or color will change to reflect change in the value of a datum to communicate information clearly and efficiently data visualization uses statistical graphics plots information graphics and other tools numerical data may be encoded using dots lines or bars to visually communicate a quantitative message effective visualization helps users analyze and reason about data and evidence it makes complex data more accessible understandable and usable users may have particular analytical tasks such as making comparisons or understanding causality and the design principle of the graphic i e showing comparisons or showing causality follows the task tables are generally used where users will look up a specific measurement while charts of various types are used to show patterns or relationships in the data for one or more variables data visualization is both an art and a

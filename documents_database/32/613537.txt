it has a general formula of ca mg fe mg fe sio the calcium cation fraction can vary from 5 to 25 with iron and magnesium making up the rest of the cations pigeonite crystallizes in the monoclinic system as does augite and a miscibility gap exists between the two minerals at lower temperatures pigeonite is unstable relative to augite plus orthopyroxene the low temperature limit of pigeonite stability depends upon the fe mg ratio in the mineral and is hotter for more mg rich compositions for a fe mg ratio of about 1 the temperature is about 900 c the presence of pigeonite in an igneous rock thus provides evidence for the crystallization temperature of the magma and hence indirectly for the water content of that magma pigeonite is found as phenocrysts in volcanic rocks on earth and as crystals in meteorites from mars and the moon in slowly cooled intrusive igneous rocks pigeonite is rarely preserved slow cooling gives the calcium the necessary time to separate itself from the structure to form exsolution lamellae of calcic clinopyroxene leaving no pigeonite present textural evidence of its breakdown to orthopyroxene plus augite may be present as shown in the accompanying

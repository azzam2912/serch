it is named for emil post who published a complete description of the lattice in 1941 the relative simplicity of post s lattice is in stark contrast to the lattice of clones on a three element or larger set which has the cardinality of the continuum and a complicated inner structure a modern exposition of post s result can be found in lau 2006 a boolean function or logical connective is an n ary operation for some where 2 denotes the two element set 0 1 particular boolean functions are the projections and given an m ary function f and n ary functions g g we can construct another n ary function called their composition a set of functions closed under composition and containing all projections is called a clone let b be a set of connectives the functions which can be defined by a formula using propositional variables and connectives from b form a clone b indeed it is the smallest clone which includes b we call b the clone generated by b and say that b is the basis of b for example are all boolean functions and 0 1 are the monotone functions we use the operations

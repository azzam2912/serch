they are precisely the transcendental numbers that can be more closely approximated by rational numbers than any algebraic irrational number in 1844 joseph liouville showed that all liouville numbers are transcendental thus establishing the existence of transcendental numbers for the first time here we show that liouville numbers exist by exhibiting a construction that produces such numbers for any integer b 2 and any sequence of integers a a such that a 0 1 2 b 1 for all k 1 2 3 and there are infinitely many k with a 0 define the number in the special case when b 10 and a 1 for all k the resulting number x is called liouville s constant it follows from the definition of x that its base b representation is where the n th term is separated from the next term by nn 1 zeros since this base b representation is non repeating it follows that x cannot be rational therefore for any rational number p q we have x p q 0 now for any integer n 1 define q and p as follows then here we will show that the number x c d where c and d

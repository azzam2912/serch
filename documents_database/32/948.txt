informally it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them the analysis of autocorrelation is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns such as the presence of a periodic signal obscured by noise or identifying the missing fundamental frequency in a signal implied by its harmonic frequencies it is often used in signal processing for analyzing functions or series of values such as time domain signals different fields of study define autocorrelation differently and not all of these definitions are equivalent in some fields the term is used interchangeably with autocovariance unit root processes trend stationary processes autoregressive processes and moving average processes are specific forms of processes with autocorrelation in statistics the autocorrelation of a real or complex random process is the pearson correlation between values of the process at different times as a function of the two times or of the time lag let formula 1 be a random process and formula 2 be any point in time formula 2 may be an integer for a discrete time process or a real number for a continuous time process then formula 4 is the value or realization produced by a given run of

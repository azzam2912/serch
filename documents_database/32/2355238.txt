to very large and complex genomes that have typically much higher ploidy higher rates of heterozygosity and repetitive elements than species from other kingdoms one of the most complex plant genome assemblies available is that of loblolly pine 22 gbp due to their complexity the plants genome sequences can t be assembled back into chromosomes using only short reads provided by next generation sequencing technologies ngs and therefore most plant genome assemblies available that used ngs alone are highly fragmented contain large numbers of contigs and genome regions are not finished highly repetitive sequences often larger than 10kbp are the main challenge in plants most of the chromosomal sequences are produced by the activity of mobile genetic elements mges in the plant genomes mges are divided into two classes class i or retrotransposons and class ii or dna transposons in plants long terminal repeat ltr retrotransposons are predominant and constitute from 15 to 90 of the genome polyploidy is another challenge in assembling a plant genome and it is estimated that 80 of plants are polyploids the first complete plant genome assembly that of arabidopsis thaliana was finished in 2000 being the third multicellular eukaryotic genome published after c elegans

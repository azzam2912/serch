it infects potatoes solanum tuberosum causing their tubers to turn pink and damages leaves it also infects tulips tulipa damaging their leaves and shoots several species from the genus phytophthora are believed to be involved in causing pink rot like diseases as phytophthora erythroseptica is an oomycete its disease cycle follows that of similar phytophthora species oospores sporangia and zoospores can infect any part of the potato plant that is below ground oospores serve as the primary form of inoculum and can survive in the soil as long as seven years oospores produced in the field can overwinter and when thawed produce an oogonium and antheridium which will then lead to the production of sporangia oospores and zoospores this pathogen can be polycyclic using sporangia as the secondary inoculum often this secondary inoculum infects tubers post harvest while in storage zoospores are motile asexual spores that can move through soil water through the use of their flagella these zoospores are also capable of encysting and infecting below ground plant tissue environmental factors play a critical role in the development and spread of p erythroseptica on a field scale this pathogen grows best in a warm and wet environment it can

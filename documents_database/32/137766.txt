popper to publish his ideas the hypothesis proposes that early life may have formed on the surface of iron sulfide minerals hence the name it was developed by retrodiction from extant biochemistry in conjunction with chemical experiments w chtersh user proposes that the earliest form of life termed pioneer organism originated in a volcanic hydrothermal flow at high pressure and high 100 c temperature it had a composite structure of a mineral base with catalytic transition metal centers predominantly iron and nickel but also perhaps cobalt manganese tungsten and zinc the catalytic centers catalyzed autotrophic carbon fixation pathways generating small molecule non polymer organic compounds from inorganic gases e g carbon monoxide carbon dioxide hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide these organic compounds were retained on or in the mineral base as organic ligands of the transition metal centers with a flow retention time in correspondence with their mineral bonding strength thereby defining an autocatalytic surface metabolism the catalytic transition metal centers became autocatalytic by being accelerated by their organic products turned ligands the carbon fixation metabolism became autocatalytic by forming a metabolic cycle in the form of a primitive sulfur dependent version of the reductive citric acid cycle accelerated catalysts

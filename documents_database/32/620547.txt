this approach uses differences in abilities and alternative costs between humans and computer agents to achieve symbiotic human computer interaction in traditional computation a human employs a computer to solve a problem a human provides a formalized problem description and an algorithm to a computer and receives a solution to interpret human based computation frequently reverses the roles the computer asks a person or a large group of people to solve a problem then collects interprets and integrates their solutions human based computation apart from the historical meaning of computer research has its origins in the early work on interactive evolutionary computation ec the idea behind interactive evolutionary algorithms is due to richard dawkins in the biomorphs software accompanying his book the blind watchmaker dawkins 1986 the preference of a human experimenter is used to guide the evolution of two dimensional sets of line segments in essence this program asks a human to be the fitness function of an evolutionary algorithm so that the algorithm can use human visual perception and aesthetic judgment to do something that a normal evolutionary algorithm cannot do however it is difficult to get enough evaluations from a single human if we want to evolve

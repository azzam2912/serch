intracellular cysts develop mainly in striated muscle after the ingestion of cysts by cats a multiplicative cycle precedes the development of gametocytes in the epithelium of the small intestine each oocyst of the species averaging 11 13 m oocyst shedding persists for 10 to 28 days followed by immunity cysts in skeletal muscle measure between 100 and 340 m in length and 40 and 95 m in width some of the intermediate hosts e g guinea pigs hamsters develop low levels of antibody and some cross immunity against toxoplasma hammondia hammondi is an apicomplexan parasite with cat as its definitive host it was discovered in 1975 and named after the eminent protozoologist d m hammond the parasite is obligate intracellular by nature and closely resembles toxoplasma gondii another zoonotic parasite of cats after bradyzoites in tissue cysts are ingested by cats just like t gondii h hammondi also multiplies both asexually and sexually in the intestines of cats and in about 1 3 days stages of parasites can be found in sections of the cat s small intestine subsequently oocysts are excreted in the faeces relation to toxoplasma gondii very similar although h hammondi has a smaller group of hosts

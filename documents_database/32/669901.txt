the writer and reader cannot run at the same time this is termed file level interlock or data set level interlock with batchpipes an installation can arrange for the data to be piped between the two jobs the advantage is that the jobs can run concurrently and it is possible and very usual to avoid the time to write the data to secondary storage and to read it back the combination of these two characteristics if used judiciously leads to a reduction in the combined elapsed time of the two jobs as measured from the start of the writer job to the end of the reader job batchpipes maintains a short queue of records being passed between the writer and the reader the writer adds records to the back of the queue and the reader takes them from the front this is deemed record level interlock and allows the reader and the writer to run concurrently a sort is a special case all the input records must be read before the first output record can be written hence there can be no overlap between the input and output phases of a sort but the input phase can be overlapped with

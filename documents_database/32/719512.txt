the genus was first described by florentino ameghino in 1897 and the type species is r equinus with lectotype macn a 52 31 fossils of rhynchippus have been found in the sarmiento formation of argentina the salla and petaca formations of bolivia and in the trememb formation of brazil rhynchippus was about in length and weighted up to with a deep body and three clawed toes on each foot although its teeth were extremely similar to those of horses or rhinos rhynchippus was actually a relative of toxodon having developed teeth suitable for grazing through convergent evolution unlike its relatives rhynchippus had no large tusks they were the same size and shape as the incisors enamel on the molars allowed it to chew tough food the genus shows similarities with mendozahippus eurygenium and pascualihippus in 2016 a well preserved specimen of r equinus was described by mart nez et al from the sarmiento formation in patagonia the extraordinary preservation of the specimen allowed the researchers to appreciate the three connected spaces that constitute a heavily pneumatized middle ear the epitympanic sinus the tympanic cavity itself and the ventral expansion of the tympanic cavity through the notably inflated bullae fossils of

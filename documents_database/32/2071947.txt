metal ions have been associated with biological systems for billions of years but only in the last century have scientists began to truly appreciate the scale of their influence major iron manganese magnesium and zinc and minor copper cobalt nickel molybdenum tungsten metal ions have become aligned with living organisms through the interplay of biogeochemical weathering and metabolic pathways involving the products of that weathering the associated complexes have evolved over time natural development of chemicals and elements challenged organisms to adapt or die current organisms require redox reactions to induce metabolism and other life processes metals have a tendency to lose electrons and are important for redox reactions metals have become so central to cellular function that the collection of metal binding proteins referred to as the metallomes accounts for over 30 of all proteins in the cell metals are known to be involved in over 40 of enzymatic reactions and metal binding proteins carry out at least one step in almost all biological pathways metals are also toxic so a balance must be acquired to regulate where the metals are in an organism as well as in what quantities many organisms have flexible systems in which they can

the resulting extension remains linear and bounded thus continuous this procedure is known as continuous linear extension every bounded linear transformation formula 2 from a normed vector space formula 1 to a complete normed vector space formula 7 can be uniquely extended to a bounded linear transformation formula 8 from the completion of formula 1 to formula 7 in addition the operator norm of formula 2 is formula 12 iff the norm of formula 8 is formula 12 this theorem is sometimes called the b l t theorem for bounded linear transformation consider for instance the definition of the riemann integral a step function on a closed interval formula 15 is a function of the form formula 16 where formula 17 are real numbers formula 18 and formula 19 denotes the indicator function of the set formula 20 the space of all step functions on formula 15 normed by the formula 22 norm see lp space is a normed vector space which we denote by formula 23 define the integral of a step function by formula 24 formula 25 as a function is a bounded linear transformation from formula 23 into formula 27 let formula 28 denote the space of

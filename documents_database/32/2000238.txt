it was introduced by thomas ferguson as a prior over probability distributions a dirichlet process formula 1 is completely defined by its parameters formula 2 the base distribution or base measure is an arbitrary distribution and formula 3 the concentration parameter is a positive real number it is often denoted as formula 4 according to the bayesian paradigm these parameters should be chosen based on the available prior information on the domain the question is how should we choose the prior parameters formula 5 of the dp in particular the infinite dimensional one formula 2 in case of lack of prior information to address this issue the only prior that has been proposed so far is the limiting dp obtained for formula 7 which has been introduced under the name of bayesian bootstrap by rubin in fact it can be proven that the bayesian bootstrap is asymptotically equivalent to the frequentist bootstrap introduced by bradley efron the limiting dirichlet process formula 7 has been criticized on diverse grounds from an a priori point of view the main criticism is that taking formula 7 is far from leading to a noninformative prior moreover a posteriori it assigns zero probability to any

the krab domain typically consists of about 75 amino acid residues while the minimal repression module is approximately 45 amino acid residues it is predicted to function through protein protein interactions via two amphipathic helices the most prominent interacting protein is called trim28 initially visualized as smp1 cloned as kap1 and tif1 beta substitutions for the conserved residues abolish repression over 10 independently encoded krab domains have been shown to be effective repressors of transcription suggesting this activity to be a common property of the domain krab domains can be fused with dcas9 crispr tools to form even stronger repressors the krab domain had initially been identified in 1988 as a periodic array of leucine residues separated by six amino acids 5 to the zinc finger region of kox1 znf10 coined heptad repeat of leucines also known as a leucine zipper later this domain was named in association with the c2h2 zinc finger proteins kr ppel associated box krab the krab domain is confined to genomes from tetrapod organisms the krab containing c2h2 znf genes constitute the largest sub family of zinc finger genes more than half of the c2h2 znf genes are associated with a krab domain in the

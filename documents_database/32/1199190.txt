the tub of the vibratory tumbler and all of its contents are then vibrated the vibratory action causes the media to rub against the workpieces which yield the desired result depending on the application this can be either a dry or wet process unlike rotary tumbling this process can finish internal features such as holes it is also quicker and quieter the process is performed in an open tub so the operator can easily observe if the required finish has been obtained vibratory tumblers have an action that is similar to filing an eccentric rotating weight shakes the tub in a circular path during which the entire load is lifted up at an angle and then dropped as the load is falling but not actually airborne the tub returns to an upward position applying an upward and angular force that causes a shearing action where the parts and media rub against each other vibratory finishing systems tend to produce a smooth finish because the media essentially laps the parts since the load is moving as a unit very fragile parts are quite safe in the vibrator there is no tearing action or unequal forces that tend to bend and distort

this constitutes a signal passed at danger spad on multiple unit trains the guard uses a buzzer code to communicate with the driver once the doors have closed and platform duties are complete the guard informs the driver by sending the signal for ready to start which is two rings hence ding ding there was a debate whether guards should only give the ready to start or station staff the right away signal if the platform starting signal was clear the british railways board refused to change the rules saying that the driver alone should have the responsibility to comply with signals initially the railway inspectorate agreed for example in the report on the early example at woolwich arsenal in 1948 however accidents in the 1970s culminating in seven people being killed at paisley gilmour street in 1979 caused the rules to be changed in 1980 with the effect that giving the signal to close doors ready to start or right away whilst the starting signal is at danger now constitutes an operating incident ding ding and away events continue to occur despite the rule change and the introduction of equipment such as the driver s reminder appliance on trains

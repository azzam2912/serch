in general legislatures first set broad policy mandates by passing statutes then agencies create more detailed regulations through rulemaking by bringing detailed scientific and other types of expertise to bear on policy the rulemaking process has been the means by which some of the most far reaching government regulations of the 20th century have been created for example science based regulations are critical to modern programs for environmental protection food safety and workplace safety however the growth in regulations has fueled criticism that the rulemaking process reduces the transparency and accountability of democratic government legislatures rely on rulemaking to add more detailed scientific economic or industry expertise to a policy fleshing out the broader mandates of authorizing legislation for example typically a legislature would pass a law mandating the establishment of safe drinking water standards and then assign an agency to develop the list of contaminants and safe levels through rulemaking the rise of the rulemaking process itself is a matter of political controversy many find that obscure and complex rulemaking tends to undercut the democratic ideal of a government that is closely watched by and accountable to its citizens although executive agencies are usually charged with executing not promulgating

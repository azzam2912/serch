the first crossbreeding was with zebras and donkeys equid hybrids can be traced back to africa where there are vast amount of equid species which resulted in natural crossing creating hybrid species these hybrids were found to be more efficient than the original species because they possess certain traits of both species so scientists began to experiment by crossing other species of horse family and categorizing them as equid hybrids equid hybrids are now bred commercially mules bred from mammoth studs and stock or draft mares can be as large as 17 hands and are as strong as a normal horse other mules are bred for pets or for entertainment such as zoos these are the miniature horses or miniature donkeys hybrids are named based on the sex and species of the parents the combination of the first half of the father s name and the second half of the mother s name zebras are usually wild animals but when they are raised with other domestic horses they are tame enough to be ridden draught mules are smaller more resistant to heat and exhaustion and much stronger horses are much larger but likely to suffer from exhaustion and heat male

the major difference was that the pwm had a tube attached to the charge running behind it with some form of stabilising fins or canvas attached to the rear of the tube for any high explosive anti tank mine or grenade to be effective against armour it must sit squarely on to the armour so that the high velocity jet of metal punches through the armour at a ninety degree angle a way of making sure this happens is to place the charge onto the armour by hand however this puts the participant into grave danger from defensive fire from the tank and other enemies a thrown version would be more versatile but it would be hard to ensure the ninety degree angle the panzerwurfmine is designed to achieve the stable flight needed by the deployment of large fins or canvas lengths at the back of the design to stabilise the trajectory of the grenade and therefore make a ninety degree angle contact more likely when the pwm hits the armour the shaped charge is activated however in combat use the panzerwurfmine often did not live up to expectations due to the relatively short range it could be thrown and

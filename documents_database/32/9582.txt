it contains high concentration of ozone o in relation to other parts of the atmosphere although still small in relation to other gases in the stratosphere the ozone layer contains less than 10 parts per million of ozone while the average ozone concentration in earth s atmosphere as a whole is about 0 3 parts per million the ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere from approximately above earth although its thickness varies seasonally and geographically the ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the french physicists charles fabry and henri buisson measurements of the sun showed that the radiation sent out from its surface and reaching the ground on earth is usually consistent with the spectrum of a black body with a temperature in the range of 5 500 6 000 k 5 227 to 5 727 c except that there was no radiation below a wavelength of about 310 nm at the ultraviolet end of the spectrum it was deduced that the missing radiation was being absorbed by something in the atmosphere eventually the spectrum of the missing radiation was matched to only one known chemical ozone its properties were explored in detail

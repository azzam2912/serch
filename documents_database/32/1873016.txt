usually a heartbeat is sent between machines at a regular interval in the order of seconds if the endpoint does not receive a heartbeat for a time usually a few heartbeat intervals the machine that should have sent the heartbeat is assumed to have failed a heartbeat protocol is generally used to negotiate and monitor the availability of a resource such as a floating ip address typically when a heartbeat starts on a machine it will perform an election process with other machines on the heartbeat network to determine which machine if any owns the resource on heartbeat networks of more than two machines it is important to take into account partitioning where two halves of the network could be functioning but not able to communicate with each other in a situation such as this it is important that the resource is only owned by one machine not one machine in each partition as a heartbeat is intended to be used to indicate the health of a machine it is important that the heartbeat protocol and the transport that it runs on is as reliable as possible causing a failover because of a false alarm may depending on the resource

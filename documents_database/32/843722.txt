the lunar magma ocean was likely present on the moon from the time of the moon s formation about 4 5 or 4 4 billion years ago to 10s or 100s of millions years after that time it is a thermodynamic consequence of the moon s relatively rapid formation in the aftermath of a giant impact between the proto earth and another planetary body as the moon accreted from the debris from the giant impact gravitational potential energy was converted to thermal energy due to the rapid accretion of the moon in about a month to a year thermal energy was trapped since it did not have sufficient time to thermally radiate away energy through the lunar surface the subsequent thermochemical evolution of the lunar magma ocean explains the moon s largely anorthositic crust europium anomaly and kreep material the lunar magma ocean was initially proposed by two groups in 1970 after they analyzed anorthositic rock fragments found in the apollo 11 sample collection wood et al used fragments of bulk sample 10085 for their analyses ferroan anorthosite rocks found during the apollo program are composed primarily over 90 of the mineral plagioclase more specifically ferroan anorthosite rocks found on

sub munition designed for use in warheads as a chemical cluster munition each spherical bomblet held of sarin nerve agent a spherical chemical cluster munition the m134 had been developed for the honest john rocket but not deployed owing to a variety of problems the m190 warhead could contain 356 bomblets in 1964 a new warhead size was standardized for the smaller diameter little john rocket the warhead held 52 m139 bomblets when the mgm 29 sergeant was deployed in the 1960s it had the capacity to deliver a warhead carrying 330 m139 bomblets subsequent missile systems including the pershing missile had the capability to carry warheads with the m139 inside in total about 60 000 m139s were produced and stored almost all were destroyed between april and november 1976 the m139 was a spherical bomblet that was filled with of sarin gb on the outside of the device were vanes the vanes created a spin which armed the impact fuze this spin to arm type fuze required between 1 000 and 2 000 rotations per minute to arm which made handling the bomblets simpler because they were insensitive to normal movements the bomblet s interior contained a central explosive

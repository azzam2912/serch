further results were made by laurent schwartz consider a complex valued function of a real variable the function is periodic with period precisely if for all real we have this can be written as where formula 2 is the difference between the dirac measures at 0 and a the function is mean periodic if it satisfies the same equation 1 but where formula 2 is some arbitrary nonzero measure with compact hence bounded support equation 1 can be interpreted as a convolution so that a mean periodic function is a function for which there exists a compactly supported signed borel measure formula 2 for which formula 5 there are several well known equivalent definitions mean periodic functions are a separate generalization of periodic functions from the almost periodic functions for instance exponential functions are mean periodic since but they are not almost periodic as they are unbounded still there is a theorem which states that any uniformly continuous bounded mean periodic function is almost periodic in the sense of bohr in the other direction there exist almost periodic functions which are not mean periodic in work related to the langlands correspondence the mean periodicity of certain functions related to zeta

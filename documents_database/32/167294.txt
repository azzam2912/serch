the species formed is the conjugate base of that acid the complementary process when a proton is added transferred to a br nsted lowry base is protonation or hydronation the species formed is the conjugate acid of that base a species that can either accept or donate a proton is referred to as amphiprotic an example is the ho water molecule which can gain a proton to form the hydronium ion ho or lose a proton leaving the hydroxide ion oh the relative ability of a molecule to give up a proton is measured by its p k value a low p k value indicates that the compound is acidic and will easily give up its proton to a base the p k of a compound is determined by many things but the most significant is the stability of the conjugate base this is primarily determined by the ability or inability of the conjugated base to stabilize negative charge one of the most important ways of assessing a conjugate base s ability to distribute negative charge is using resonance electron withdrawing groups which can stabilize the molecule by increasing charge distribution or electron donating groups which destabilize by decreasing charge

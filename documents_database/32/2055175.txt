the wittig reaction generates the allyl vinyl ether intermediate that further participates in a claisen rearrangement to generate the final unsaturated ketone or aldehyde product figure modified wittig claisen tandem reactions the modified wittig claisen tandem reaction has been a useful retrosynthetic strategy and has been applied to the synthesis of various complex natural products and other molecules this reaction is especially useful for construction of cyclic ketones with double bond at the position paquette and co workers reported the synthesis of 4 cyclooctenone structure by expanding the six membered ring of a 2 cyclohexanone structure the key step was a tandem process that combines tebbe olefination a reaction similar to wittig reaction with claisen rearrangement figure application of modified wittig claisen tandem reactions for construction of 4 cyclooctenone structure tandem wittig claisen reaction has also been applied to the construction of the spiro pyrrolidin 3 3 oxindole ring system in natural products such as horsfiline the synthesis started with a simple o nitrobenzaldehyde a wittig claisen reaction sequence converted the starting material to a 4 pentenal derivative that could serve as a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of various natural products in this case the 4 pentenal derivative was

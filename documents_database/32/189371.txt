neutrinos are created as a result of certain types of radioactive decay or nuclear reactions such as those that take place in the sun in nuclear reactors or when cosmic rays hit atoms due to their weak interactions with matter neutrinos offer a unique opportunity to observe processes that are inaccessible to optical telescopes neutrinos were first recorded in 1956 by clyde cowan and frederick reines in an experiment employing a nearby nuclear reactor as a neutrino source their discovery was acknowledged with a nobel prize for physics in 1995 this was followed by the first atmospheric neutrino detection in 1965 by two groups almost simultaneously one was led by frederick reines who operated a liquid scintillator the case witwatersrand irvine or cwi detector in the east rand gold mine in south africa at an 8 8 km water depth equivalent the other was a bombay osaka durham collaboration that operated in the indian kolar gold field mine at an equivalent water depth of 7 5 km although the kgf group detected neutrino candidates two months later than reines cwi they were given formal priority due to publishing their findings two weeks earlier in 1968 raymond davis jr and john

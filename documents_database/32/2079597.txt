he was a pupil of jean baptiste perrin at the faculty of sciences in paris and performed theoretical studies in the field of chemical kinetics ren marcelin developed the first theoretical treatment of the rate of chemical reactions that goes beyond a simple empirical description he showed that the expression of the rate constant given by the arrhenius equation had to be composed of two terms in addition to the activation energy term he considered that there had to be an activation entropy term in 1910 rene marcelin introduced the concept of standard gibbs energy of activation in 1912 he treated the progress of a chemical reaction as a motion of a point in phase space using gibbs statistical mechanical methods he obtained an expression similar to the one which he had obtained earlier from thermodynamic consideration in 1913 ren marcelin was also the first to use the term potential energy surface he theorized that the progress of a chemical reaction could be described as a point in a potential energy surface with coordinates in atomic momenta and distances in his phd thesis which he defended in 1914 he developed a general theory on absolute reaction rates in which he

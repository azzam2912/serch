it measures 2 5 mm the two and one half nuclear whorls form a depressed helicoid spire whose axis is almost at right angles to that of the succeeding turns in the first of which it is about one half immersed the seven post nuclear whorls are very slightly rounded strongly constricted at the sutures and prominently shouldered at the summit they are marked by well rounded tuberculate axial ribs of which 14 occur upon the first and second 16 upon the third 18 upon the fourth and fifth and 24 upon the penultimate turn in addition to the axial ribs the whorls are marked between the sutures by four spiral cords which equal the ribs in strength and render them tuberculate at their junction the sutures are broadly and deeply channeled the periphery and the somewhat prolonged base of the body whorl are well rounded the latter marked by seven narrow almost equal and equally spaced spiral keels the broad space between which and the peripheral sulcus are marked by many slender axial riblets the aperture is oval the outer lip is thin showing the external sculpture within the columella is stout slightly curved strongly reflected over the reinforcing

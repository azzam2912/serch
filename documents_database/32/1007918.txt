typically it consists of a vertical pole normally around a meter high which is connected to the top of a landmine when the track or main body of a vehicle passes over the mine the rod is tilted releasing a spring loaded striker which triggers a pyrotechnic delay of approximately half a second followed by detonation of the main explosive charge the small time delay allows the vehicle to continue over the mine before detonating exposing more of it to the blast a tilt rod fuze has a number of advantages over pressure fuzes it acts across the entire width of a vehicle rather than just its tracks or tires this allows it to attack the vehicle s belly and potentially cause a catastrophic kill additionally tilt rod fuzes tend to be resistant to blast overpressure clearing methods which can trigger most pressure fuzes the main disadvantage is the visible rod mechanism which may be negated by laying the mine in undergrowth in any case minefields containing anti tank mines with tilt rods may also include other designs of mine which are entirely buried e g the m19 anti tank mine plus various antipersonnel mines intended to hinder people removing

this colorless solid is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents and not in water triphenylmethane is the basic skeleton of many synthetic dyes called triarylmethane dyes many of them are ph indicators and some display fluorescence a trityl group in organic chemistry is a triphenylmethyl group phc e g triphenylmethyl chloride trityl chloride and the triphenylmethyl radical trityl radical triphenylmethane was first synthesized in 1872 by the german chemist august kekul and his belgian student antoine paul nicolas franchimont 1844 1919 by heating diphenylmercury hg ch quecksilberdiphenyl with benzal chloride chchcl benzylenchlorid triphenylmethane can be synthesized by friedel crafts reaction from benzene and chloroform with aluminium chloride catalyst alternatively benzene may react with carbon tetrachloride using the same catalyst to obtain the trityl chloride aluminium chloride adduct which is hydrolyzed with dilute acid synthesis from benzylidene chloride prepared from benzaldehyde and phosphorus pentachloride is used as well the p k of the hydrogen on the central carbon is 33 triphenylmethane is significantly more acidic than most other hydrocarbons because the charge is delocalized over three phenyl rings steric effects however prevent all three phenyl rings from achieving coplanarity simultaneously the trityl anion is red this colour can be used as an

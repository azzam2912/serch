bernstein it can be used to verify the data integrity and the authenticity of a message a variant of bernstein s poly1305 that does not require aes has been standardized by the internet engineering task force in rfc 8439 the original proposal poly1305 aes which uses aes block cipher to expand key computes a 128 bit 16 bytes authenticator of a variable length message using a 128 bit aes key a 128 bit additional key with 106 effective key bits r and a 128 bit nonce the message is broken into 16 byte chunks which become coefficients of a polynomial in r evaluated modulo the prime number 2 5 the name is derived from this and the use of 2 5 and the advanced encryption standard in nacl poly1305 is used with salsa20 instead of aes in tls and ssh it is used with chacha20 keystream google has selected poly1305 along with bernstein s chacha20 symmetric cipher as a replacement for rc4 in tls ssl which is used for internet security google s initial implementation is used in securing https tls ssl traffic between the chrome browser on android phones and google s websites use of chacha20 poly1305 has been

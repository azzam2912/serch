the proportionality of with temperature was discovered by ludvig lorenz in 1872 qualitatively this relationship is based upon the fact that the heat and electrical transport both involve the free electrons in the metal the mathematical expression of the law can be derived as following electrical conduction of metals is a well known phenomenon and is attributed to the free conduction electrons which can be measured as sketched in the figure the current density j is observed to be proportional to the applied electric field and follows ohm s law where the prefactor is the specific electrical conductivity since the electric field and the current density are vectors ohm s law is expressed here in bold face the conductivity can in general be expressed as a tensor of the second rank 3 3 matrix here we restrict the discussion to isotropic i e scalar conductivity the specific resistivity is the inverse of the conductivity both parameters will be used in the following drude c 1900 realized that the phenomenological description of conductivity can be formulated quite generally electron ion heat etc conductivity although the phenomenological description is incorrect for conduction electrons it can serve as a preliminary treatment the assumption

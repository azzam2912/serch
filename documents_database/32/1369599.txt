the disease caused by h nelsoni is also known as msx multinucleated unknown or multinuclear sphere x msx is thought to have been introduced by experimental transfers of the pacific oyster crassostrea gigas which is resistant to this disease msx was first described in 1957 when it caused serious mortalities in delaware bay through extensive studies an estimated 50 of eastern oyster c virginica mortalities in lower delaware bay since the 1960s could be attributed to msx infections a devastating loss to the area mortalities are usually highest in the summer and also increase in higher salinity waters msx reduces the feeding rates of infected oysters leading to a reduced amount of stored carbohydrates the reduction in stored carbohydrates inhibits normal gametogenesis in the spring with a reduction in fecundity in the spring of 1959 the msx appeared in chesapeake bay within 3 years more than 90 of the oysters in the lower bay were affected salinities of at least 15 ppt are considered necessary for infection with msx and salinities of about 20 ppt usually are necessary to elicit high oyster mortalities the presence of h nelsoni in the chesapeake bay has hindered attempts to return eastern oyster harvests

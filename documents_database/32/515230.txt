rubble piles have low density because there are large cavities between the various chunks that make them up asteroids bennu and ryugu have a measured bulk density which suggests a rubble pile internal structure many comets and most smaller minor planets are thought to be composed of coalesced rubble most smaller asteroids are thought to be rubble piles rubble piles form when an asteroid or moon which may originally be monolithic is smashed to pieces by an impact and the shattered pieces subsequently fall back together primarily due to self gravitation this coalescing usually takes from several hours to weeks when a rubble pile asteroid passes a much more massive object tidal forces change its shape scientists first suspected that asteroids are often rubble piles when asteroid densities were first determined many of the calculated densities were significantly less than those of meteorites which in some cases had been determined to be pieces of asteroids many asteroids with low densities are thought to be rubble piles for example 253 mathilde the mass of mathilde as determined by the near shoemaker mission is far too low for the volume observed considering the surface is rock even ice with a thin crust

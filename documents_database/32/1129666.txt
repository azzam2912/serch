they participate in a variety of biological processes including cellular respiration calcification acid base balance bone resorption and the formation of aqueous humor cerebrospinal fluid saliva and gastric acid they show extensive diversity in tissue distribution and in their subcellular localization ca1 is closely linked to ca2 and ca3 genes on chromosome 8 and it encodes a cytosolic protein which is found at the highest level in erythrocytes transcript variants of ca1 utilizing alternative polya sites have been described in literature the human ca1 protein contains an n terminus active site zinc binding site and substrate binding site the crystal structure of the human ca1 bicarbonate anion complex reveals the geometry of two h bonds between the glu106 thr199 pair and the glu117 his119 pair and one pi h bond between a water molecule and the phenyl ring of the tyr114 residue the product inhibition of ca1 via bicarbonate anions is correlated to the proton localization change on his119 so the glu117 his119 h bond is considered to regulate the ionicity of the zinc ion and the binding strength of the bicarbonate anion the reaction catalyzed by ca1 is the same as other carbonic anhydrase family proteins the ca1 catalyzed

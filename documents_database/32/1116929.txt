the project was developed by some of the folding home team at stanford university from about 2007 through 2011 scientists such as those running folding home deal with massive amounts of data which must be stored and backed up and this is very expensive traditionally methods such as storing the data on raid servers are used but these become impractical for research budgets at this scale pande s research group already dealt with storing hundreds of terabytes of scientific data professor vijay pande and student adam beberg took experience from folding home and began work on storage home the project is designed based on the distributed file system known as cosm and the workload and analysis needed for folding home results while folding home volunteers can easily participate in storage home much more disk space is needed from the user than folding home to create a robust network volunteers each donate 10 gb of storage space which would hold encrypted files these users gain points as a reward for reliable storage each file saved on the system is replicated four times each spread across 10 geographically distant hosts redundancy also occurs over different operating systems and across time zones if

the program launched in 2015 with sponsorship from the deep carbon observatory the project will end after 2019 mineralogist robert hazen and his colleagues pioneered the concept of mineral evolution to explain how life and geology have intertwined throughout earth s multi billion year past as part of that research the group developed a model that combines the locations and distributions of known minerals to predict the number of unknown carbon minerals on earth the method is similar to statistical methods used in biology hazen and his group predicted that 145 carbon minerals remain undiscovered on earth a paper supporting the research carbon mineral ecology was published by american mineralogist in 2015 and the carbon mineral challenge was announced in 2015 at the american geophysical union fall meeting meeting in san francisco geochemist daniel hummer southern illinois university is the project lead carbon is the focus of the project due to the element s importance to life on earth and how little is known about it the research behind the carbon mineral challenge is based on a type of analysis called large number of rare events lnre modeling to arrive at their total of 145 previously undescribed carbon minerals hazen

the term nanobiotechnology can be defined in multiple ways in a more general sense nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that uses both nano scale materials i e materials having characteristic dimensions of 1 100 nanometers and biologically based materials a more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger functional structures the implementation of nanobiotechnology as defined in this narrower sense provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer biocomputers use biologically derived materials to perform computational functions a biocomputer consists of a pathway or series of metabolic pathways involving biological materials that are engineered to behave in a certain manner based upon the conditions input of the system the resulting pathway of reactions that takes place constitutes an output which is based on the engineering design of the biocomputer and can be interpreted as a form of computational analysis three distinguishable types of biocomputers include biochemical computers biomechanical computers and bioelectronic computers biochemical computers use the immense variety of feedback loops that are

they were widespread in europe asia africa and north america at least 5 million to about 1 2 million years ago early pliocene to early pleistocene fossils very similar to dinofelis from lothagam range back to the late miocene some 8 million years ago in size they were between a modern leopard and a lion with most about the size of a jaguar 70 cm tall and up to 120 kg they were medium sized but powerful cats with a pair of prominent saber teeth the front limbs were particularly robust compared to modern cats even the jaguar two specimens were examined by serge legendre and claudia roth for body mass the first specimen was estimated to weigh the second the canine teeth of dinofelis are longer and more flattened than those of modern cats but less than those of true saber tooths hence the designation of dinofelis and nimravids as false saber tooth cats however nimravids are not close relatives of dinofelis while the lower canines are robust the cheek teeth are not nearly as robust as those of the lion and other modern big cats based on dinofelis likely preference of forest habitats ethologist william allen et al

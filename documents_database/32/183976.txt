the primary function of these cells is to secrete calcitonin they are located adjacent to the thyroid follicles and reside in the connective tissue these cells are large and have a pale stain compared with the follicular cells in teleost and avian species these cells occupy a structure outside the thyroid gland named the ultimobranchial body parafollicular cells are pale staining cells found in small number in the thyroid and are typically situated basally in the epithelium without direct contact with the follicular lumen they are always situated within the basement membrane which surrounds the entire follicle parafollicular cells are derived from pharyngeal endoderm embryologically they associate with the ultimobranchial body which is a ventral derivative of the fourth or fifth pharyngeal pouch parafollicular cells were previously believed to be derived from the neural crest based on a series of experiments in quail chick chimeras however lineage tracing experiments in mice revealed that parafollicular cells are derived from the endoderm origin parafollicular cells secrete calcitonin a hormone that participates in the regulation of calcium metabolism it is important in fish and rodents but its relevance in human calcium homeostasis has not been demonstrated calcitonin lowers blood levels of calcium by

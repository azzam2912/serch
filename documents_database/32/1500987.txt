its affinity for the 5 ht receptor was reported to be 4 8 nm k or 8 33 pk and its intrinsic activity approximately equal to that of serotonin i e 100 eptapirone and related high efficacy 5 ht full and super agonists such as befiradol and f 15 599 were developed under the hypothesis that the maximum exploitable therapeutic benefits of 5 ht receptor agonists might not be able to be seen without the drugs employed possessing sufficiently high intrinsic activity at the receptor as 5 ht receptor agonism based on animal and other research looked extremely promising for the treatment of depression from a theoretical perspective this idea was developed as a potential explanation for the relatively modest clinical effectiveness seen with already available 5 ht receptor agonists like buspirone and tandospirone which act merely as weak to moderate partial agonists of the receptor in the porsolt forced swimming test eptapirone was found to suppress immobility more robustly than buspirone ipsapirone flesinoxan paroxetine and imipramine which was suggestive of strong antidepressant like effects in this assay unlike the other drugs screened buspirone actually increased the immobility time with a single administration while repeated administration decreased it an effect

bacteria in the phylum tenericutes serve as natural hosts making these viruses bacteriophages there are currently seven species in this genus including the type species acholeplasma phage mv l51 group ssdna the virons are non enveloped rod shaped and filamentous the capsid has a helical symmetry and is generally has a length of 85 280 nm or 760 1950 nm and a width of 10 16 nm or 6 8 nm respectively these morphological differences depend on the species there are five or more proteins in the capid gp8 the major capsid protein gp6 gp7 and gp8 minor capsid proteins and gp3 which acts as the initial host binding protein the genomes are non segmented circular positive sense single stranded dna 4 4 8 5 kilobases in length they encode 4 to 11 proteins replication of the genome occurs via a dsdna intermediate and the rolling circle mechanism gene transcription is by the host s cellular machinery each gene having a specific promoter there are six steps in the life cycle a typical replication cycle normally take 10 15 minutes to complete this is mediated by one of the viral proteins gp3 binding to the host receptor the conversion from

it is required for the proper folding of many proteins to function properly groel requires the lid like cochaperonin protein complex groes in eukaryotes the proteins hsp60 and hsp10 are structurally and functionally nearly identical to groel and groes respectively within the cell the process of groel es mediated protein folding involves multiple rounds of binding encapsulation and release of substrate protein unfolded substrate proteins bind to a hydrophobic binding patch on the interior rim of the open cavity of groel forming a binary complex with the chaperonin binding of substrate protein in this manner in addition to binding of atp induces a conformational change that allows association of the binary complex with a separate lid structure groes binding of groes to the open cavity of the chaperonin induces the individual subunits of the chaperonin to rotate such that the hydrophobic substrate binding site is removed from the interior of the cavity causing the substrate protein to be ejected from the rim into the now largely hydrophilic chamber the hydrophilic environment of the chamber favors the burying of hydrophobic residues of the substrate inducing substrate folding hydrolysis of atp and binding of a new substrate protein to the opposite cavity

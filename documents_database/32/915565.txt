louis pasteur was selected to the acad mie des sciences in 1862 he later became the professor of geology physics and chemistry at the cole des beaux art the effect can be explained as the yeast being facultative anaerobes can produce energy using two different metabolic pathways while the oxygen concentration is low the product of glycolysis pyruvate is turned into ethanol and carbon dioxide and the energy production efficiency is low 2 moles of atp per mole of glucose if the oxygen concentration grows pyruvate is converted to acetyl coa that can be used in the citric acid cycle which increases the efficiency to 31 or 29 5 moles of atp per mole of glucose it depends on which shuttle is used for reducing the reducing equivalent nadh that is formed in the cytosol therefore about 15 times as much glucose must be consumed anaerobically as aerobically to yield the same amount of atp under anaerobic conditions the rate of glucose metabolism is faster but the amount of atp produced as already mentioned is smaller when exposed to aerobic conditions the atp and citrate production increases and the rate of glycolysis slows because the atp and citrate produced act

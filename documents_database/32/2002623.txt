in november 2013 phase ii clinical trials were initiated and in the same month rislenemdaz received fast track designation from the food and drug administration for trd a pilot study was published in 2012 and a phase ii trial was completed in 2014 but was deemed insufficient a second attempt at a phase ii trial in 2016 also found that the drug failed to demonstrate efficacy against depression rislenemdaz is a small molecule antagonist of the nmda receptor the nmda receptor is composed of several subunits but rislenemdaz is specific for the glun2b subunits which are only seen in the spinal cord and forebrain rislenemdaz binds specifically to the glun2b subunit in order to prevent endogenous glutamate from acting on it it is considered to be a novel drug for the treatment of mdd and trd for its immediate onset of efficacy in an oral dosage form rislenemdaz and its active metabolite have been shown to have an onset of action of about 1 hour and half lives of 12 17h and 21 26h respectively it has been proven to have a very high binding affinity for its target k 8 1 nm this specificity allows rislenemdaz to mitigate the

typical properties i e strength of cement applications such as concrete will be added to clean the air around the photocatalytic surface nitrogen dioxide no will be particularly abated when daylight activates the photocatalytic surfaces the chemical process may be summarized as follows tio h tio h e ho h h oh using materials like tiocem the abatement of no could be measured by a test method using the italian standard uni 11247 which is being discussed as the basis of a european standard this method involves test apparatus in which a mixture of air and pollutant flows in a chamber over a test object the pollutant burden is measured with and without exposure to light a defined level of no abatement is guaranteed by the label tx active plus an initial and replication of the test results proof of the effective reduction of oxide of nitrogen exposure has been furnished under close to practical conditions by the picada photocatalytic innovative coverings applications for depollution assessment project supported by the european union and other studies since the photocatalytic effect is needed only on the surface of a building which is exposed to uv tiocem is used primarily in the top

featool multiphysics features the ability to model fully coupled heat transfer fluid dynamics chemical engineering structural mechanics fluid structure interaction fsi electromagnetics as well as user defined and custom pde problems in 1d 2d axisymmetry or 3d all within a simple graphical user interface gui or optionally as convenient script files having specifically been designed to have a low learning curve and to be able to be used without requiring reading documentation featool has been employed and used in academic research teaching and industrial engineering simulation contexts featool multiphysics is a fully integrated physics and pde simulation environment where the modeling process is subdivided into six steps preprocessing cad and geometry modeling mesh and grid generation physics and pde specification boundary condition specification solution and postprocessing and visualization the featool graphical user interface gui shown above has been specifically designed to be very easy to use and quickly get started with specifically because of the full integration of cad and simulation tools users can quickly and easily switch between pre processing analysis and post processing modes to change simulation parameters modify geometry and meshes to solution evaluation and visualization in this way featool can make up for any performance overhead

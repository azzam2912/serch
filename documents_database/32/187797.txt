the son of a powerful bishop roger owed his position to his family connections he lost his office when his father and other relatives lost power arrested along with his father roger was used to secure the surrender of a castle held by his mother and then disappeared from history roger was the son of roger of salisbury lord chancellor for king henry i of england and bishop of salisbury and matilda of ramsbury it is possible that roger of salisbury was married to matilda prior to his elevation to the episcopate but this is unlikely because their son roger le poer was described as young in 1139 it is most likely that he was born after his father s consecration as bishop in 1107 a biographer of roger of salisbury edward kealey has argued that roger le poer is the same person as roger the archdeacon of berkshire who died in the 1160s another possibility that the younger roger was the same as roger of ramsbury archdeacon of wiltshire is less likely as it is known that roger of ramsbury was not closely related to adelelm the nephew or son of roger of salisbury the historian diana greenway in

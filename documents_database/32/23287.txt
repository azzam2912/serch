ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles collisions with other atoms molecules and ions or through the interaction with electromagnetic radiation heterolytic bond cleavage and heterolytic substitution reactions can result in the formation of ion pairs ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the internal conversion process in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the inner shell electrons causing it to be ejected everyday examples of gas ionization are such as within a fluorescent lamp or other electrical discharge lamps it is also used in radiation detectors such as the geiger m ller counter or the ionization chamber the ionization process is widely used in a variety of equipment in fundamental science e g mass spectrometry and in industry e g radiation therapy negatively charged ions are produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently trapped inside the electric potential barrier releasing any excess energy the process is known as electron capture ionization positively charged ions are produced by transferring an amount of energy to a bound electron in a collision with charged particles e g ions electrons or positrons or with photons the threshold

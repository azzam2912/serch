in so doing the latent heat is released by the substance and transferred to the surrounding environment condensers are used for efficient heat rejection in many industrial systems condensers can be made according to numerous designs and come in many sizes ranging from rather small hand held to very large industrial scale units used in plant processes for example a refrigerator uses a condenser to get rid of heat extracted from the interior of the unit to the outside air condensers are used in air conditioning industrial chemical processes such as distillation steam power plants and other heat exchange systems use of cooling water or surrounding air as the coolant is common in many condensers the earliest laboratory condenser a gegenstromk hler counter flow condenser was invented in 1771 by the swedish german chemist christian weigel by the mid 19th century german chemist justus von liebig would provide his own improvements on the preceding designs of weigel and johann friedrich august g ttling with the device becoming known as the liebig condenser a condenser is designed to transfer heat from a working fluid e g water in a steam power plant to a secondary fluid or the surrounding air the

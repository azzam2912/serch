it was both bmw s first and only production v10 engine and the first petrol v10 engine to be available in a production sedan saloon introduced in the e60 m5 the s85 was inspired by bmw s previous formula 1 involvement unlike most other bmw m engines the s85 is not related to a regular production bmw engine the bmw s65 v8 engine used in the e92 m3 is based on the s85 as the s85 was bmw s first v10 engine it was given a new series in the bmw s engine codes the 60s were used for v8 engines and the 70s were used for v12 engines therefore the v10 was allocated in the 80s despite having fewer cylinders than the v12 engines in the 70s the engine code for the related bmw s65 v8 engine reflects its link to the s85 the s65 code was selected to signify that the v8 is largely derived from the s85 minus two cylinders and not related to bmw s other v8s the s85 has dual overhead camshafts with four valves per cylinder and double vanos variable valve timing the engine block and cylinder head are constructed from aluminum alloy peak

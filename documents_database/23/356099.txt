in magnetic confinement the tendency of the hot plasma to expand is counteracted by the lorentz force between currents in the plasma and magnetic fields produced by external coils the particle densities tend to be in the range of to and the linear dimensions in the range of the particle and energy confinement times may range from under a millisecond to over a second but the configuration itself is often maintained through input of particles energy and current for times that are hundreds or thousands of times longer some concepts are capable of maintaining a plasma indefinitely in contrast with inertial confinement there is nothing to counteract the expansion of the plasma the confinement time is simply the time it takes the plasma pressure to overcome the inertia of the particles hence the name the densities tend to be in the range of to and the plasma radius in the range of 1 to 100 micrometers these conditions are obtained by irradiating a millimeter sized solid pellet with a nanosecond laser or ion pulse the outer layer of the pellet is ablated providing a reaction force that compresses the central 10 of the fuel by a factor of 10 or

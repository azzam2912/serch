based in evansville indiana television preview is a division of rsc the quality measurement company a member of the arsgroup the preview offer is considered a scam because even though television preview takes no money from viewers the company is not associated with any actual television producers and the pilots they preview are years old viewers are instead asked to rate the commercials they see also under the guise of selecting prizes they d like to win in a drawing viewers choose their favorites from pages of pictures of consumer products in addition while invitations are distributed to adults of all ages most of the attendees are senior citizens aged 50 or over with the commercials and questions slanted towards them participants are promised food during the dinnertime viewing which is mostly or completely withheld and it is difficult for participants to even get water during the several hours of viewing not surprisingly many of the ads that are then presented to viewers are for food and refreshments the few prizes that are given away at these events are suspiciously accepted by what are probably people working for the company and not actual viewers television preview randomly sends out invitations

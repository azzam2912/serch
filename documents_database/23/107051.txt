ideally the rotation changes direction at a constant angular rate this is a key principle in the operation of the alternating current motor rotating magnetic fields are often utilized for electromechanical applications such as induction motors and electric generators however they are also used in purely electrical applications such as induction regulators a symmetric rotating magnetic field can be produced with as few as two polar wound coils driven at 90 degrees phasing however 3 sets of coils are nearly always used because it is compatible with a symmetric 3 phase ac sine current system the three coils are driven with each set driven 120 degrees in phase from the others for the purpose of this example the magnetic field is taken to be the linear function of the coil s current the result of adding three 120 degrees phased sine waves on the axis of the motor is a single rotating vector which remains always constant in magnitude the rotor has a constant magnetic field the n pole of the rotor will move toward the s pole of the magnetic field of the stator and vice versa this magneto mechanical attraction creates a force which will drive the rotor

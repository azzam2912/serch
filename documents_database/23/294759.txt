steam cracking is used in the petroleum industry to produce the lighter alkenes hydrous pyrolysis may be a significant process in the creation of fossil fuels simple heating without water anhydrous pyrolysis has long been considered to take place naturally during the catagenesis of kerogens to fossil fuels in recent decades it has been found that water under pressure causes more efficient breakdown of kerogens at lower temperatures than without it the carbon isotope ratio of natural gas also suggests that hydrogen from water has been added during creation of the gas u s patent 2 177 557 describes a two stage process in which a mixture of water wood chips and calcium hydroxide is heated in the first stage at temperatures in a range of with the pressure higher than that of saturated steam at the temperature used this produces oils and alcohols which are collected the materials are then subjected in a second stage to what is called dry distillation which produces oils and ketones temperatures and pressures for this second stage are not disclosed zhang et al at the university of illinois report on a hydrous pyrolysis process in which swine manure is converted to oil by

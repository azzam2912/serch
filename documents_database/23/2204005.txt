it has an apparent visual magnitude of 4 60 indicating that it is visible to the naked eye based upon an annual parallax shift of 2 87 mass it is roughly 1 100 light years distant from the sun this is a double lined spectroscopic binary which means that the individual absorption lines of both components can be discerned the pair orbit each other with a period of 2 526 days and a low eccentricity of 0 04 the close orbit is causing their mutual gravitational interaction to distort the shapes of the stars turning this system into an ellipsoidal variable the inclination of orbital plane is sufficiently low that the two stars form a grazing eclipsing binary during the eclipse of the primary component the visual magnitude is reduced by 0 06 whereas the secondary eclipse reduces the magnitude by 0 03 the combined spectrum of psi orionis matches that of a b type subgiant star with a stellar classification of b2 iv the primary component is a evolved giant star with a class of b1 iii while the secondary is a b type main sequence star with a classification of b2 v

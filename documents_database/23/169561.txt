dove prisms are shaped from a truncated right angle prism the dove prism is named for its inventor heinrich wilhelm dove a beam of light travelling parallel to the longitudinal axis entering one of the sloped faces of the prism undergoes total internal reflection from the inside of the longest bottom face and emerges from the opposite sloped face images passing through the prism are flipped mirrored and because only one reflection takes place the image is also inverted but not laterally transposed refraction at the entrance and exit surfaces results in substantial image astigmatism when used in convergent light thus the dove prism is used almost exclusively for images appearing at infinity if the flat hypoteneuse surface of a dove prism is cut into a roof shape the result is an amici roof prism a reflection in one axis of a plane is always equivalent to a reflection and rotation in two other axes with the angle between the source and image being twice the angle between the source and reflection axis of the prism thus dove prisms can be used to create beam rotators which have applications in fields such as interferometry astronomy and pattern recognition lesso and

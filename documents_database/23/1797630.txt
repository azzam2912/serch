chronic radiation syndrome develops with a speed and severity proportional to the radiation dose received i e it is a deterministic effect of exposure to ionizing radiation unlike radiation induced cancer it is distinct from acute radiation syndrome in that it occurs at dose rates low enough to permit natural repair mechanisms to compete with the radiation damage during the exposure period dose rates high enough to cause the acute form 0 1 gy h are fatal long before onset of the chronic form the lower threshold for chronic radiation syndrome is between 0 7 and 1 5 gy at dose rates above 0 1 gy yr this condition is primarily known from the kyshtym disaster where 66 cases were diagnosed it has received little mention in western literature but see the icrp s 2012 statement in 2013 alexander v akleyev described the chronology of the clinical course of crs while presenting at conrad in munich germany in his presentation he defined the latent period as being 1 5 years and the formation coinciding with the period of maximum radiation dose the recovery period was described as being 3 12 months after exposure ceased he concluded that crs represents a

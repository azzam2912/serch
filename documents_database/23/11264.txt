it occurs when using a photographic flash very close to the camera lens as with most compact cameras in ambient low light in flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil the camera records this reflected light the main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina the blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid and plays virtually no role the eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect the lens cuts off deep blue and violet light below 430 nm depending on age and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea melanin located in the retinal pigment epithelium rpe and the choroid shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths

it is a generalization of the catalan numbers and is named after eug ne charles catalan bailey shows that formula 1 satisfy the following properties formula 3 shows that the entry in the triangle is obtained recursively by adding numbers to the left and above in the triangle the earliest appearance of the catalan triangle along with the recursion formula is in page 214 of the treatise on calculus published in 1800 by louis fran ois antoine arbogast shapiro introduces another triangle which he calls the catalan triangle that is distinct from the triangle being discussed here the general formula for formula 1 is given by where and are nonnegative integers and denotes the factorial thus for 0 formula 9 the diagonal is the th catalan number the row sum of the th row is the th catalan number some values are given by catalan s trapezoids are a countable set of number trapezoids which generalize catalan s triangle catalan s trapezoid of order is a number trapezoid whose entries formula 10 give the number of strings consisting of x s and y s such that in every initial segment of the string the number of y s does not

it is applicable to both combinatorial and continuous problems with either a static or noisy objective the method approximates the optimal importance sampling estimator by repeating two phases reuven rubinstein developed the method in the context of rare event simulation where tiny probabilities must be estimated for example in network reliability analysis queueing models or performance analysis of telecommunication systems the method has also been applied to the traveling salesman quadratic assignment dna sequence alignment max cut and buffer allocation problems consider the general problem of estimating the quantity formula 1 where formula 2 is some performance function and formula 3 is a member of some parametric family of distributions using importance sampling this quantity can be estimated as formula 4 where formula 5 is a random sample from formula 6 for positive formula 2 the theoretically optimal importance sampling density pdf is given by formula 8 this however depends on the unknown formula 9 the ce method aims to approximate the optimal pdf by adaptively selecting members of the parametric family that are closest in the kullback leibler sense to the optimal pdf formula 10 in several cases the solution to step 3 can be found analytically situations in

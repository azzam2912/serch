the task takes place within an operant chamber equipped with at least five holes apertures that can illuminate and a food tray to deliver reward the 5csrtt requires the animal typically a rat although mice can also be used to correctly identify which of the five apertures has been briefly illuminated via a nose poke in order to receive a sugar reward the difficulty of the task is controlled by the length of time the aperture is illuminated a shorter illumination time requires the animal to pay greater attention and thus is more difficult as shown by decreased accuracy between every trial there is also a short interval wherein the animal must withhold all responses and any responding during this interval is met with a brief time out and recorded as a failure of inhibitory control the 5csrtt was initially designed by trevor robbins and colleagues in the early 1980s as an analogue of the human continuous performance task because the 5csrtt has separate measures of attention impulsivity and reaction times it has proven useful in the pre clinical study of the treatment of diagnoses such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and is also a precursor to modern rodent models

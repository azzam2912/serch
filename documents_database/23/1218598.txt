ultrabattery combines ultracapacitor technology with lead acid battery technology in a single cell with a common electrolyte research conducted by independent laboratories such as the united states s sandia national laboratories the advanced lead acid battery consortium alabc the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and commercial tests by east penn manufacturing furukawa battery and ecoult indicate that in comparison with conventional valve regulated lead acid vrla batteries ultrabattery technology has higher energy efficiencies a longer lifetime and superior charge acceptance under partial state of charge soc conditions combining the two technologies in one battery cell means that ultrabattery works very efficiently compared with conventional lead acid technologies largely due to the fact that it can be operated for long periods in a partial state of charge psoc whereas conventional lead acid batteries are more typically designed for high soc use i e when the battery is close to fully charged operating in the partial soc range extends the battery s life chiefly by reducing sulfation and by reducing time spent operating at very high and very low states of charge where various side reactions tend to cause deterioration a conventional vrla battery tends to deteriorate quickly when operated

the mechanism varies from linear action plunger type actuators to pivoted armature actuators and rocker actuators the valve can use a two port design to regulate a flow or use a three or more port design to switch flows between ports multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a manifold solenoid valves are the most frequently used control elements in fluidics their tasks are to shut off release dose distribute or mix fluids they are found in many application areas solenoids offer fast and safe switching high reliability long service life good medium compatibility of the materials used low control power and compact design there are many valve design variations ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths a 2 way valve for example has 2 ports if the valve is open then the two ports are connected and fluid may flow between the ports if the valve is closed then ports are isolated if the valve is open when the solenoid is not energized then the valve is termed normally open n o similarly if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized then the valve is termed normally closed there are also 3 way

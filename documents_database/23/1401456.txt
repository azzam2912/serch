many members of this genus were previously assigned to a different genus spiromonas the type species is colpodella pugnax these are small m in diameter flagellated protists the life cycle of consists of two main stages flagellated trophozoites and cysts which are the reproductive stage in the life cycle morphologically the trophozoites of colpodella are similar to perkinsus zoospores although the two taxa are not specifically related the motile stages of both genera have a pair of anterior orthogonal flagella vesicular mitochondrial cristae inner alveolar membranes and micropores both colpodella and perkinsus species have open sided truncated conoids sometimes called pseudoconoids rhoptries that occupy the length of the cell and smaller micronemes both the rhoptries and micronemes arise at the anterior portion of the cell a three layered pellicle lies beneath the plasma membrane and is otherwise composed of the alveolar membranes and widely separated microtubules that arise subapically some species have extrusive organelles trichocysts unlike perkinsus colpodella are free living and are voracious predators of other free living protists most species apparently penetrate through the cell membrane and consume the prey s cytoplasm this mode of feeding is known as myzocytosis while feeding the predator attaches its anterior portion

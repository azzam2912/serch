alternative measurements are also established mixtures may have variable thermal conductivities due to composition note that for gases in usual conditions heat transfer by advection caused by convection or turbulence for instance is the dominant mechanism compared to conduction this table shows thermal conductivity in si units of watts per metre kelvin w m k some measurements use the imperial unit btus per foot per hour per degree fahrenheit this concerns materials at atmospheric pressure and around thermal conductivities have been measured with longitudinal heat flow methods where the experimental arrangement is so designed to accommodate heat flow in only the axial direction temperatures are constant and radial heat loss is prevented or minimized for the sake of simplicity the conductivities that are found by that method in all of its variations are noted as l conductivities those that are found by radial measurements of the sort are noted as r conductivities and those that are found from periodic or transient heat flow are distinguished as p conductivities numerous variations of all of the above and various other methods have been discussed by some g k white m j laubits d r flynn b o peirce and r w wilson

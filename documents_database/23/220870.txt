it can be a result of vigorous exercise but abnormal fatigue may be caused by barriers to or interference with the different stages of muscle contraction there are two main causes of muscle fatigue the limitations of a nerve s ability to generate a sustained signal neural fatigue and the reduced ability of the muscle fiber to contract metabolic fatigue muscle cells work by detecting a flow of electrical impulses from the brain which signals them to contract through the release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum fatigue reduced ability to generate force may occur due to the nerve or within the muscle cells themselves nerves are responsible for controlling the contraction of muscles determining the number sequence and force of muscular contraction most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate and barring pathological nervous fatigue is seldom an issue but in extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle s ability to generate force nervous fatigue enervation in which the nerve signal weakens can be a limiting factor in untrained individuals in novice strength trainers the muscle s ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve s

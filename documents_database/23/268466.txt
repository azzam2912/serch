david parnas tracing the history of automatic programming in published research noted that in the 1940s it described automation of the manual process of punching paper tape later it referred to translation of high level programming languages like fortran and algol in fact one of the earliest programs identifiable as a compiler was called autocode parnas concluded that automatic programming has always been a euphemism for programming in a higher level language than was then available to the programmer program synthesis is one type of automatic programming where a procedure is created from scratch based on mathematical requirements mildred koss an early univac programmer explains writing machine code involved several tedious steps breaking down a process into discrete instructions assigning specific memory locations to all the commands and managing the i o buffers after following these steps to implement mathematical routines a sub routine library and sorting programs our task was to look at the larger programming process we needed to understand how we might reuse tested code and have the machine help in programming as we programmed we examined the process and tried to think of ways to abstract these steps to incorporate them into higher level language this

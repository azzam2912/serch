the rocks are located within the tract between two elements of the welsh borderland fault system the church stretton fault and the pontesford linley lineament the stretton group is a predominantly sedimentary group with a range of facies attributable to that of a closing ocean the wentnor group overlies the stretton group of rocks and although the units are separate together they show a good geological progression at the base of the stretton group the rocks are of basinal oceanic facies and as time goes a coarsening occurs with increased terrigenous input from the continent turbidites are observed and deltas form latterly with alluvial plains with occasional marine washovers this creeps up into the wentnor group where alluvial plains latterly with fluvial and alluvial deposits noted in the uppermost youngest bridges formation the information below is present oldest to youngest as it makes much more sense in this way one should read the wentnor group stratigraphy as well in order to get a sense of continuity the progradational longmyndian sequence from oldest to youngest is ragleth tuff formation stretton shale formation burway formation synalds formation lightspout formation portway formation bayston oakswood formation bridges formation the latter two units belong to

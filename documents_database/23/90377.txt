its most significant feature is somewhat enhanced concentration of a majority of so called incompatible elements those that are concentrated in the liquid phase during magma crystallization and the heat producing elements namely radioactive uranium thorium and potassium due to presence of the radioactive k the typical composition of kreep includes about one percent by mass of potassium and phosphorus oxides 20 to 25 parts per million of rubidium and a concentration of the element lanthanum that is 300 to 350 times the concentrations found in carbonaceous chondrites most of potassium phosphorus and rare earth elements in kreep basalts are incorporated in the grains of the phosphate minerals apatite and merrillite indirectly it has been deduced that the origin of kreep is contained in the origin of the moon this is now commonly thought to be the result of a rocky object the size of mars that struck the earth about 4 5 billion 4 5 10 years ago this collision threw a large amount of broken rock into orbit around the earth this ultimately gathered together to form the moon given the high energy such a collision would involve it has been deduced that a large portion of the

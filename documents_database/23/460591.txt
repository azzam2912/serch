such a population can be genetically monomorphic or polymorphic maynard smith 1982 contrast this with the definition of an evolutionarily stable strategy which is a game theory concept an ess or evolutionarily stable strategy is a strategy such that if all the members of a population adopt it no mutant strategy can invade maynard smith 1982 evolutionarily stable states are frequently used to identify solutions to the replicator equation given in its linear payoff form by the state formula 2 is said to be evolutionarily stable if for all formula 3 in some neighborhood of formula 2 this is similar but distinct from the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy it can be shown that for the replicator equation if a state is evolutionarily stable then it is an asymptotically stable rest point so the evolutionarily stable states are often taken as solutions of the replicator equation the converse is true if the game matrix is symmetric the concept of evolutionary stability is equivalent to the concept of strong stability for normal form games due to cressman

the microscope can map out buried current carrying wires by measuring the magnetic fields produced by the currents or can be used to image fields produced by magnetic materials by mapping out the current in an integrated circuit or a package short circuits can be localized and chip designs can be verified to see that current is flowing where expected a high temperature scanning squid microscope using a ybco squid is capable of measuring magnetic fields as small as 20 pt about 2 million times weaker than the earth s magnetic field the squid sensor is sensitive enough that it can detect a wire even if it is carrying only 10 na of current at a distance of 100 m from the squid sensor with 1 second averaging the microscope uses a patented design to allow the sample under investigation to be at room temperature and in air while the squid sensor is under vacuum and cooled to less than 80 k using a cryo cooler no liquid nitrogen is used during non contact non destructive imaging of room temperature samples in air the system achieves a raw unprocessed spatial resolution equal to the distance separating the sensor from the

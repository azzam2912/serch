this includes protein coding genes as well as rna genes but may also include prediction of other functional elements such as regulatory regions gene finding is one of the first and most important steps in understanding the genome of a species once it has been sequenced in its earliest days gene finding was based on painstaking experimentation on living cells and organisms statistical analysis of the rates of homologous recombination of several different genes could determine their order on a certain chromosome and information from many such experiments could be combined to create a genetic map specifying the rough location of known genes relative to each other today with comprehensive genome sequence and powerful computational resources at the disposal of the research community gene finding has been redefined as a largely computational problem determining that a sequence is functional should be distinguished from determining the function of the gene or its product predicting the function of a gene and confirming that the gene prediction is accurate still demands in vivo experimentation through gene knockout and other assays although frontiers of bioinformatics research are making it increasingly possible to predict the function of a gene based on its sequence alone gene

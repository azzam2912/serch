vector calculus plays an important role in differential geometry and in the study of partial differential equations it is used extensively in physics and engineering especially in the description of electromagnetic fields gravitational fields and fluid flow vector calculus was developed from quaternion analysis by j willard gibbs and oliver heaviside near the end of the 19th century and most of the notation and terminology was established by gibbs and edwin bidwell wilson in their 1901 book vector analysis in the conventional form using cross products vector calculus does not generalize to higher dimensions while the alternative approach of geometric algebra which uses exterior products does generalize as discussed below a scalar field associates a scalar value to every point in a space the scalar may either be a mathematical number or a physical quantity examples of scalar fields in applications include the temperature distribution throughout space the pressure distribution in a fluid and spin zero quantum fields such as the higgs field these fields are the subject of scalar field theory a vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a subset of space a vector field in the plane for instance can be visualized

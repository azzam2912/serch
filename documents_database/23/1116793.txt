this gene encodes the light alpha subunit which has been proposed as a primary component of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease cgd which is characterized by the failure of activated phagocytes to generate superoxide which is important for the microbicidal activity of these cells the p22phox protein phox for phagocytic oxidase was first identified in 1987 during the purification of the cytochrome b 245mv from human neutrophils a few years before this low potential cytochrome b also called cytochrome b558 cytb because of its spectral properties was demonstrated as the major component of the microbicidal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph oxidase complex in phagocytes cytb the redox element of the nadph oxidase complex is a membrane heterodimer composed of two subunits p22phox also called the alpha or small subunit or the light chain of the cytb and gp91phox renamed nox2 in the 2000s or the beta or heavy chain or large subunit by screening a cdna library constructed from human promyelocytic leukemia cells parkos et al isolated a cdna corresponding to the light chain of cytb the importance of the role of p22phox was evidenced by the

his main contributions were improvements to steam engines and industrializing the extraction of lighting gas from wood he died assassinated in 1804 he also designed though apparently did not build a wood gas engine not the first like other early engines it had no compression in its main cylinder it has three mechanically connected cylinders each double acting one to compress the air one to compress the gas and one driven by the burned mixture this engine resembles an internal combustion engine but the combustion actually takes place in a combustion chamber separated by mechanically controlled valves from the cylinders this makes it a steam engine running on combustion products instead of on steam or the piston equivalent of a gas turbine hardenberg s analysis shows a theoretical efficiency and specific power much less than those of the earlier street engine but this assumes that the intake valve stays open during the whole power stroke assuming that the inventor had more in his mind than what he wrote on paper and therefore allowing arbitrary valve timing its idealized thermodynamic cycle is similar to that of a gas turbine which can have a high compression ratio and relatively high efficiency this

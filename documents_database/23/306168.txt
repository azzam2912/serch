based on ideas by hagino tatsuya it is completely grounded in category theory disregarding interactions with the outside world all charity programs are guaranteed to terminate or stay productive charity was an interesting exercise in non turing complete programming languages that is capable of expressing the ackermann function alas it seems to have not been active over the last 10 years though it would be of interest to anyone interested in seeing how far one can take a non tc language links added the shown examples include also solving the tower of hanoi problem source charity is also related to the total functional programming languages the language allows ordinary recursive data types such as might be found in ml which are required to be finite and corecursive data types which are allowed to be potentially infinite the control structure for operating on recursive data types is primitive recursion or paramorphism and the control structure for corecursive data types is primitive co recursion or apomorphism neither control structure can operate over the other kind of data so all paramorphisms terminate and all apomorphisms are productive

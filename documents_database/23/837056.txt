it is an insertion reaction in that the methylene group from the diazomethane is inserted into the carbon chlorine bond of the acid chloride the reaction proceeds through a diazonium salt intermediate formed by nucleophilic acyl substitution of the chloride with diazomethyl anion the chloride then displaces the diazo group in an sn2 reaction with n as the leaving group if excess diazomethane is present during the reaction it can act as a base abstracting a hydrogen from the diazonium salt intermediate the result is a neutral diazoketone which does not react with the chloride instead the byproduct diazonium methyl from the other diazomethane molecule can be attacked by the chloride to produce chloromethane the unreactive diazoketone can be re activated and reacted by treatment with hydrogen chloride to give the normal nierenstein product in some cases even limiting the amount of diazomethane gives a reaction process that stalls via the neutral diazoketone pathway requiring the addition of hcl gas to rescue it one original 1924 nierenstein reaction and a reaction starting from benzoyl bromide going haywire with formation of the dioxane dimer

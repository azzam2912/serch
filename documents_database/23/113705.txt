sloc is typically used to predict the amount of effort that will be required to develop a program as well as to estimate programming productivity or maintainability once the software is produced many useful comparisons involve only the order of magnitude of lines of code in a project using lines of code to compare a 10 000 line project to a 100 000 line project is far more useful than when comparing a 20 000 line project with a 21 000 line project while it is debatable exactly how to measure lines of code discrepancies of an order of magnitude can be clear indicators of software complexity or man hours there are two major types of sloc measures physical sloc loc and logical sloc lloc specific definitions of these two measures vary but the most common definition of physical sloc is a count of lines in the text of the program s source code excluding comment lines logical sloc attempts to measure the number of executable statements but their specific definitions are tied to specific computer languages one simple logical sloc measure for c like programming languages is the number of statement terminating semicolons it is much easier to create

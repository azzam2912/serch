the mould is closed with a top force or plug member pressure is applied to force the material into contact with all mould areas while heat and pressure are maintained until the moulding material has cured the process employs thermosetting resins in a partially cured stage either in the form of granules putty like masses or preforms compression molding is a high volume high pressure method suitable for molding complex high strength fiberglass reinforcements advanced composite thermoplastics can also be compression molded with unidirectional tapes woven fabrics randomly oriented fiber mat or chopped strand the advantage of compression molding is its ability to mold large fairly intricate parts also it is one of the lowest cost molding methods compared with other methods such as transfer molding and injection molding moreover it wastes relatively little material giving it an advantage when working with expensive compounds however compression molding often provides poor product consistency and difficulty in controlling flashing and it is not suitable for some types of parts fewer knit lines are produced and a smaller amount of fiber length degradation is noticeable when compared to injection molding compression molding is also suitable for ultra large basic shape production in sizes

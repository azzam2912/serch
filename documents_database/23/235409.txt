he shared half of the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1958 with george beadle for showing that genes control individual steps in metabolism the other half of that year s award went to joshua lederberg beadle and tatum s key experiments involved exposing the bread mold neurospora crassa to x rays causing mutations in a series of experiments they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways these experiments published in 1941 led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions known as the one gene one enzyme hypothesis tatum went on to study genetics in bacteria an active area of research in his laboratory was to understand the basis of tryptophan biosynthesis in escherichia coli later tatum and his student joshua lederberg showed that e coli could share genetic information through recombination tatum was born in boulder colorado he attended the college at the university of chicago for two years and transferred to the university of wisconsin madison where he received his ba in 1931 and phd in 1934 starting in 1937 he worked at stanford university where he began his collaboration with beadle he then moved to yale

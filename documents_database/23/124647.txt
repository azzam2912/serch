these are spread by blood feeding diptera such as black flies and mosquitoes this disease belongs to the group of diseases called helminthiases eight known filarial nematodes use humans as their definitive hosts these are divided into three groups according to the niche they occupy in the body the adult worms which usually stay in one tissue release early larval forms known as microfilariae into the host s bloodstream these circulating microfilariae can be taken up with a blood meal by the arthropod vector in the vector they develop into infective larvae that can be transmitted to a new host individuals infected by filarial worms may be described as either microfilaraemic or amicrofilaraemic depending on whether microfilariae can be found in their peripheral blood filariasis is diagnosed in microfilaraemic cases primarily through direct observation of microfilariae in the peripheral blood occult filariasis is diagnosed in amicrofilaraemic cases based on clinical observations and in some cases by finding a circulating antigen in the blood the most spectacular symptom of lymphatic filariasis is elephantiasis edema with thickening of the skin and underlying tissues which was the first disease discovered to be transmitted by mosquito bites elephantiasis results when the parasites lodge in

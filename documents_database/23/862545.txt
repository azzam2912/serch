it uses hyperbolic functions in the change of variables to transform an integral on the interval x 1 1 to an integral on the entire real line t the two integrals having the same value after this transformation the integrand decays with a double exponential rate and thus this method is also known as the double exponential de formula for a given step size h the integral is approximated by the sum with the abscissas and the weights the tanh sinh method is quite insensitive to endpoint behavior should singularities or infinite derivatives exist at one or both endpoints of the 1 1 interval these are mapped to the endpoints of the transformed interval forcing the endpoint singularities and infinite derivatives to vanish this results in a great enhancement of the accuracy of the numerical integration procedure which is typically performed by the trapezoidal rule in most cases the transformed integrand displays a rapid roll off decay enabling the numerical integrator to quickly achieve convergence like gaussian quadrature tanh sinh quadrature is well suited for arbitrary precision integration where an accuracy of hundreds or even thousands of digits is desired the convergence is exponential in the discretization sense for sufficiently

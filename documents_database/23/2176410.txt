similarly to complex polytopes points are not ordered and there is no sense of between and thus a quaternionic polytope may be understood as an arrangement of connected points lines planes and so on where every point is the junction of multiple lines every line of multiple planes and so on likewise each line must contain multiple points each plane multiple lines and so on since the quaternions are non commutative a convention must be made for the multiplication of vectors by scalars which is usually in favour of left multiplication as is the case for the complex polytopes the only quaternionic polytopes to have been systematically studied are the regular ones like the real and complex regular polytopes their symmetry groups may be described as reflection groups for example the regular quaternionic lines are in a one to one correspondence with the finite subgroups of u h the binary cyclic groups binary dihedral groups binary tetrahedral group binary octahedral group and binary icosahedral group

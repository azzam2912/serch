as an example mechanical work and heat are process functions because they describe quantitatively the transition between equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system path functions depend on the path taken to reach one state from another different routes give different quantities examples of path functions include work heat and arc length in contrast to path functions state functions are independent of the path taken thermodynamic state variables are point functions differing from path functions for a given state considered as a point there is a definite value for each state variable and state function infinitesimal changes in a process function x are often indicated by formula 1 to distinguish them from infinitesimal changes in a state function y which is written formula 2 the quantity formula 2 is an exact differential while formula 1 is not it is an inexact differential infinitesimal changes in a process function may be integrated but the integral between two states depends on the particular path taken between the two states whereas the integral of a state function is simply the difference of the state functions at the two points independent of the path taken in general a process function x may be either holonomic

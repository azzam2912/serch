they were derived by the famous physiologist archibald vivian hill this is a popular state equation applicable to skeletal muscle that has been stimulated to show tetanic contraction it relates tension to velocity with regard to the internal thermodynamics the equation is where although hill s equation looks very much like the van der waals equation the former has units of energy dissipation while the latter has units of energy hill s equation demonstrates that the relationship between f and v is hyperbolic therefore the higher the load applied to the muscle the lower the contraction velocity similarly the higher the contraction velocity the lower the tension in the muscle this hyperbolic form has been found to fit the empirical constant only during isotonic contractions near resting length the muscle tension decreases as the shortening velocity increases this feature has been attributed to two main causes the major appears to be the loss in tension as the cross bridges in the contractile element and then reform in a shortened condition the second cause appears to be the fluid viscosity in both the contractile element and the connective tissue whichever the cause of loss of tension it is a viscous friction

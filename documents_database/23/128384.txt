w cooley and john tukey is the most common fast fourier transform fft algorithm it re expresses the discrete fourier transform dft of an arbitrary composite size n n n in terms of n smaller dfts of sizes n recursively to reduce the computation time to o n log n for highly composite n smooth numbers because of the algorithm s importance specific variants and implementation styles have become known by their own names as described below because the cooley tukey algorithm breaks the dft into smaller dfts it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the dft for example rader s or bluestein s algorithm can be used to handle large prime factors that cannot be decomposed by cooley tukey or the prime factor algorithm can be exploited for greater efficiency in separating out relatively prime factors the algorithm along with its recursive application was invented by carl friedrich gauss cooley and tukey independently rediscovered and popularized it 160 years later this algorithm including its recursive application was invented around 1805 by carl friedrich gauss who used it to interpolate the trajectories of the asteroids pallas and juno but his work was not widely recognized being published

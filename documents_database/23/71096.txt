it occurs when an operation on two numbers increases relative error substantially more than it increases absolute error for example in subtracting two nearly equal numbers known as catastrophic cancellation the effect is that the number of significant digits in the result is reduced unacceptably ways to avoid this effect are studied in numerical analysis the effect can be demonstrated with decimal numbers the following example demonstrates loss of significance for a decimal floating point data type with 10 significant digits consider the decimal number a floating point representation of this number on a machine that keeps 10 floating point digits would be which is fairly close when measuring the error as a percentage of the value it is very different when measured in order of precision the value x is accurate to while the value y is only accurate to now perform the calculation the answer accurate to 20 significant digits is however on the 10 digit floating point machine the calculation yields in both cases the result is accurate to same order of magnitude as the inputs 20 and 10 respectively in the second case the answer seems to have one significant digit which would amount to loss

merrell chemical company in the 1940s it is currently known only in scientific research and has never been developed for market use cypenamine is currently legal throughout the entire world and though its chemical structure has a vague similarity to certain controlled stimulants like fencamfamine it is likely that it is too distant for it to be considered an illicit analogue under the united states federal analogue act of the controlled substances act 2 phenylcyclopentan 1 amine is a compound with two stereocenters thus the following two enantiomeric pairs may exist the racemate trans 2 phenylcyclopentan 1 amine 1 1 mixture of 1 r 2 s trans 2 phenylcyclopentan 1 amine box left and 1 s 2 r trans 2 phenylcyclopentan 1 amine box right is the active ingredient of cypenamine furthermore the kinetic resolution of trans 2 phenylcyclopentan 1 amine by lipase b from candida antarctica may effectivily performed by an aminolysis reaction racemic cis 2 phenylcyclopentan 1 amine 1 1 mixture of 1 r 2 r cis 2 phenylcyclopentan 1 amine and 1 s 2 s cis 2 phenylcyclopentan 1 amine has found no pharmacological application cypenamine is a homolog of tranylcypromine containing an expanded alicyclic ring that

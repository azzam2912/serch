the synthetic elements are those with atomic numbers 95 118 as shown in purple on the accompanying periodic table these 24 elements were created between 1944 and 2010 the mechanism for the creation of a synthetic element is to force additional protons onto the nucleus of an element with an atomic number lower than ninety five all synthetic elements are unstable but they decay at a widely varying rate their half lives range from 15 6 million years to a few hundred microseconds plutonium atomic number 94 first synthesized in 1940 is the element with the largest number of protons and equivalent atomic number to be non synthetic and is extremely well known due to its use in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors no elements with an atomic number greater than 99 have any uses outside of scientific research since they have extremely short half lives and thus have never been produced in large quantities seven other elements that were created artificially and thus initially considered to be synthetic were later discovered to exist in nature in trace quantities the first technetium was created in 1937 any elements with atomic number greater than 94 present at the formation of the

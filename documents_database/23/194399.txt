the spinal component gives a rapid onset of a predictable block the indwelling epidural catheter gives the ability to provide long lasting analgesia and to titrate the dose given to the desired effect this technique is suitable whenever a rapid onset of analgesia is required but the period of analgesia required exceeds that of a single spinal injection it may be used for caesarean sections seeking the advantage of using a minimal dose of local anaesthetic in order to have a quicker termination of the spinal anaesthesia but still having the catheter available in case the patient requires more than the minimal amount of medication to remain comfortable it was hoped that this technique for caesarean section would yield greater maternal satisfaction with less hypotension and its associated nausea but it is not clear that the technique has many advantages this technique also allows for post operative pain relief via epidural patient controlled anaesthesia the epidural catheter may be left in place for up to 72 hours if required in labouring women the onset of analgesia is more rapid with cse compared with epidural analgesia cse in labour was formerly thought to enable women to mobilise for longer compared with

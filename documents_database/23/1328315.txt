the process of segregation occurs during as well as during subsequent handling of completed mix and it is pronounced with free flowing powders powders that are not free flowing or that exhibit high forces of cohesion or adhesion between particles of similar or dissimilar composition are often difficult to mix owing to agglomeration the clumps of particles can be broken down in such cases by the use of mixtures that generate high shear forces or that subject the powder to impact when these powders have been mixed however they are less susceptible to segregation because of the relatively high interparticulates forces that resist interparticulate motion leading to unmixing particles segregation is commonly called demixing in industrial environment the five major segregation mechanisms are sifting occurs when there is a significant variation of particle diameter in a mix interparticle motion causes the finer particles to sift through the coarser ones vibration of the mixture is bringing the small particles below the coarse one which has as an effect to have coarse particles closer to the surface of the mixture in this mechanism the lighter or fluffier particles form a fluidized layer only coarser particles can penetrate the fluidized fines and the

it can be defined as the standard enthalpy change when a b is cleaved by homolysis to give fragments a and b which are usually radical species the enthalpy change is temperature dependent and the bond dissociation energy is often defined to be the enthalpy change of the homolysis at 0 k absolute zero although the enthalpy change at 298 k standard conditions is also a frequently encountered parameter as a typical example the bond dissociation energy for one of the c h bonds in ethane ch is defined as the standard enthalpy change of the process to convert a molar bde to the energy needed to dissociate the bond per molecule the conversion factor 23 060 kcal mol 96 485 kj mol for each ev can be used a variety of experimental techniques including spectrometric determination of energy levels generation of radicals by pyrolysis or photolysis measurements of chemical kinetics and equilibrium and various calorimetric and electrochemical methods have been used to measure bond dissociation energy values nevertheless bond dissociation energy measurements are challenging and are subject to considerable error the majority of currently known values are accurate to within 1 or 2 kcal mol 4 10 kj mol

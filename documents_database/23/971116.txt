in the late 1990s this concept became a partial reality when scientists in japan developed chicken female sperm by injecting bone marrow stem cells from a female chicken into a rooster s testicles this technique proved to fall below expectations however and has not yet been successfully adapted for use on humans creating female sperm was first raised as a possibility in a patent filed in 1991 by injecting a woman s cells into a man s testicles though the patent focused mostly on injecting altered male cells into a man s testes to correct genetic diseases in 1997 japanese scientists partially confirmed such techniques by creating chicken female sperm in a similar manner however the ratio of produced w chromosome bearing w bearing spermatozoa fell substantially below expectations it is therefore concluded that most of the w bearing pgc could not differentiate into spermatozoa because of restricted spermatogenesis these simple transplantation methods follow from earlier observations by developmental biologists that germ stem cells are autonomous in the sense that they can begin the processes to become both sperm and eggs one potential roadblock to injecting a woman s cells into a man s testicles is that the man s

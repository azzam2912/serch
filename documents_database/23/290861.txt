saltwater intrusion occurs naturally to some degree in most coastal aquifers owing to the hydraulic connection between groundwater and seawater because saline water has a higher mineral content than freshwater it is denser and has a higher water pressure as a result saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater certain human activities especially groundwater pumping from coastal freshwater wells have increased saltwater intrusion in many coastal areas water extraction drops the level of fresh groundwater reducing its water pressure and allowing saltwater to flow further inland other contributors to saltwater intrusion include navigation channels or agricultural and drainage channels which provide conduits for saltwater to move inland sea level rise could also contribute to saltwater intrusion saltwater intrusion can also be worsened by extreme events like hurricane storm surges at the coastal margin fresh groundwater flowing from inland areas meets with saline groundwater from the ocean the fresh groundwater flows from inland areas towards the coast where elevation and groundwater levels are lower because saltwater has a higher content of dissolved salts and minerals it is denser than freshwater causing it to have higher hydraulic head than freshwater hydraulic head refers to the liquid pressure exerted by a water column

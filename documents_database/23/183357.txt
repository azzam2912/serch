the filter media start with fine sand on the top and then graduatingly coarser sand in a number of layers followed by gravel on the bottom in gradually larger sizes the top sand physically removes particles from the water the job of the subsequent layers is to support the finer layer above and provide efficient drainage as particles become trapped in the media the differential pressure across the bed increases periodically a backwash may be initiated to remove the solids trapped in the bed during backwash flow is directed in the opposite direction as normal flow in multi media filters the layers in the media re stratify due to density differences prior to resuming normal filtration municipal drinking water systems often use a rapid sand filter and or a slow sand filter for purification media filters are used to protect water quality in streams rivers and lakes they can be effective at removing pollutants in stormwater such as suspended solids and phosphorus sand is the most common filter material in other filters sometimes called organic filters wood chips or leaf mold may be used media filters are also used for cleaning the effluent from septic tanks and primary settlement tanks

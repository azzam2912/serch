it also synthesizes a natural antibiotic protein barnase a widely studied ribonuclease that forms a famously tight complex with its intracellular inhibitor barstar and plantazolicin an antibiotic with selective activity against bacillus anthracis it is used in agriculture aquaculture and hydroponics to fight root pathogens such as ralstonia solanacearum pythium rhizoctonia solani alternaria tenuissima and fusarium as well improve root tolerance to salt stress they are considered a growth promoting rhizobacteria and have the ability to quickly colonize roots b amyloliquefaciens was discovered in soil 1943 by a japanese scientist named fukumoto who gave the bacterium its name because it produced faciens a liquifying lique amylase amylo alpha amylase from b amyloliquefaciens is often used in starch hydrolysis it is also a source of subtilisin which catalyzes the breakdown of proteins in a similar way to trypsin b amyloliquefaciens is considered a root colonizing biocontrol bacterium and is used to fight some plant root pathogens in agriculture aquaculture and hydroponics it has been shown to provide benefits to plants in both soil and hydroponic applications it takes action against bacterial and fungi pathogens and may prevent infection though competitive exclusion or out competing the unwanted pathogen it has been shown

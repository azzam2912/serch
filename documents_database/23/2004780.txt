also the eponym planck formula belongs on this list but also often refers to planck s law instead these various eponyms are far from standard they are used only sporadically neither regularly nor very widely they refer to a formula integral to quantum mechanics which states that the energy of a photon known as photon energy is proportional to its frequency formula 1 the constant of proportionality is known as the planck constant several equivalent forms of the relation exist including in terms of angular frequency formula 2 the relation accounts for quantized nature of light and plays a key role in understanding phenomena such as the photoelectric effect and planck s law of black body radiation see also the planck postulate light can be characterized using several spectral quantities such as frequency wavelength wavenumber formula 3 and their angular equivalents angular frequency angular wavelength and angular wavenumber these quantities are related through so the planck relation can take the following standard forms as well as the following angular forms the standard forms make use of the planck constant the angular forms make use of the reduced planck constant here is the speed of light the de broglie relation also

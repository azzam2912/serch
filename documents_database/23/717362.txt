it is possible to extend d uniquely to a graded derivation this means that for any a b e which are homogeneous elements formula 2 of degree 1 on the exterior algebra of e then the pair e d is said to be a lie coalgebra if d 0 i e if the graded components of the exterior algebra with derivation formula 4 form a cochain complex just as the exterior algebra and tensor algebra of vector fields on a manifold form a lie algebra over the base field k the de rham complex of differential forms on a manifold form a lie coalgebra over the base field k further there is a pairing between vector fields and differential forms however the situation is subtler the lie bracket is not linear over the algebra of smooth functions formula 6 the error is the lie derivative nor is the exterior derivative formula 7 it is a derivation not linear over functions they are not tensors they are not linear over functions but they behave in a consistent way which is not captured simply by the notion of lie algebra and lie coalgebra further in the de rham complex the derivation is

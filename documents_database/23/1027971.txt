it is a toxic compound because like many alkyl halides it is an alkylating agent it reacts with cysteine residues in proteins it is often used to modify sh groups to prevent the re formation of disulfide bonds after the reduction of cystine residues to cysteine during protein sequencing iodoacetate is an irreversible inhibitor of all cysteine peptidases with the mechanism of inhibition occurring from alkylation of the catalytic cysteine residue see schematic in comparison with its amide derivative iodoacetamide iodoacetate reacts substantially slower this observation appears contradictory to standard chemical reactivity however the presence of a favourable interaction between the positive imidazolium ion of the catalytic histidine and the negatively charged carboxyl group of the iodoacetic acid is the reason for the increased activity of iodoacetamide several studies have shown iodoacetate has anti tumor effects in 2002 dr fawzia fahim showed that a single iaa treatment of tumor bearing mice significantly increased the levels of plasma lactate dehydrogenase ldh activity while it also significantly decreased the levels of plasma glucose and liver total protein rna and dna compared to normal controls in 1975 melvin s rhein joyce a filppi and victor s moore showed that iodoacetate improved the immune

the ideal environment for the organism is a water temperature of though it is capable of growing in waters of thermotoga maritima is the only bacterium known to grow at this high a temperature the only other organisms known to live in environments this extreme are members of the domain archaea the hyperthermophilic abilities of t maritima along with its deep lineage suggests that it is potentially a very ancient organism t maritima is a non sporulating rod shaped gram negative bacterium when viewed under a microscope it can be seen to be encased in a sheath like envelope which resembles a toga hence the toga in its name as an anaerobic fermentative chemoorganotrophic organism t maritima catabolizes sugars and polymers and produces carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas as by products of fermentation t maritima is also capable of metabolizing cellulose as well as xylan yielding h that could potentially be utilized as an alternative energy source to fossil fuels additionally this species of bacteria is able to reduce fe iii to produce energy using anaerobic respiration various flavoproteins and iron sulphur proteins have been identified as potential electron carriers for use during cellular respiration however when growing with sulfur

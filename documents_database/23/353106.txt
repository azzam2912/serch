the hubbard model named after john hubbard is the simplest model of interacting particles in a lattice with only two terms in the hamiltonian see example below a kinetic term allowing for tunneling hopping of particles between sites of the lattice and a potential term consisting of an on site interaction the particles can either be fermions as in hubbard s original work or bosons in which case the model is referred to as either the bose hubbard model or the boson hubbard model the hubbard model is a good approximation for particles in a periodic potential at sufficiently low temperatures where all the particles may be assumed to be in the lowest bloch band and long range interactions between the particles can be ignored if interactions between particles at different sites of the lattice are included the model is often referred to as the extended hubbard model the model was originally proposed in 1963 to describe electrons in solids and has since been a focus of particular interest as a model for high temperature superconductivity more recently the bose hubbard model has been used to describe the behavior of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices recent ultracold atom experiments

it can describe phenomena in curved spacetime as well as in flat minkowski spacetime in which the spacetime curvature caused by the energy momentum tensor can be disregarded since this article considers only flat spacetime and uses the definition that special relativity is the theory of flat spacetime while general relativity is a theory of gravitation in terms of curved spacetime it is consequently concerned with accelerated frames in special relativity for the representation of accelerations in inertial frames see the article acceleration special relativity where concepts such as three acceleration four acceleration proper acceleration hyperbolic motion etc are defined and related to each other a fundamental property of such a frame is the employment of the proper time of the accelerated observer as the time of the frame itself this is connected with the clock hypothesis which is experimentally confirmed according to which the proper time of an accelerated clock is unaffected by acceleration thus the measured time dilation of the clock only depends on its momentary relative velocity the related proper reference frames are constructed using concepts like comoving orthonormal tetrads which can be formulated in terms of spacetime frenet serret formulas or alternatively using fermi walker transport

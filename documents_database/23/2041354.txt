the model was first put forward by guillermo calvo in his 1983 article staggered prices in a utility maximizing framework the original article was written in a continuous time mathematical framework but nowadays is mostly used in its discrete time version the calvo model is the most common way to model nominal rigidity in new keynesian dsge macroeconomic models we can define the probability that the firm can reset its price in any one period as h the hazard rate or equivalently the probability 1 h that the price will remain unchanged in that period the survival rate the probability h is sometimes called the calvo probability in this context in the calvo model the crucial feature is that the price setter does not know how long the nominal price will remain in place the probability of the current price lasting for exactly i periods more is the probability of surviving i subsequent periods thus follows a geometric distribution with the expected duration of the nominal price from when it is first set is formula 2 for example if the calvo probability h is 0 25 per period the expected duration is 4 periods since the calvo probability is constant

ypbpr is the analog version of the ycbcr color space the two are numerically equivalent but ypbpr is designed for use in analog systems while ycbcr is intended for digital video ypbpr is commonly referred to as component video by manufacturers however there are many types of component video most of which are some form of rgb some video cards come with video in video out vivo ports for connecting to component video devices ypbpr is converted from the rgb video signal which is split into three components y p and p to send a green signal as a fourth component is redundant as it can be derived using the blue red and luma information when color signals were first added to the ntsc encoded black and white video standard the hue was represented by a phase shift of a color reference sub carrier p for phase information or phase shift has carried through to represent color information even in the case where there is no longer a phase shift used to represent hue thus the y p p nomenclature derives from engineering metrics developed for the ntsc color standard the same cables can be used for ypbpr and composite

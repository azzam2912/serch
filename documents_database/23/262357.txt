one may explain human vision by noting that light from the outside world forms an image on the retinas in the eyes and something or someone in the brain looks at these images as if they are images on a movie screen this theory of vision is sometimes termed the theory of the cartesian theater it is most associated nowadays with the psychologist david marr the question arises as to the nature of this internal viewer the assumption here is that there is a little man or homunculus inside the brain looking at the movie the reason why this is a fallacy may be understood by asking how the homunculus sees the internal movie the obvious answer is that there is another homunculus inside the first homunculus s head or brain looking at this movie but that raises the question of how this homunculus sees the outside world to answer that seems to require positing another homunculus inside this second homunculus s head and so forth in other words a situation of infinite regress is created the problem with the homunculus argument is that it tries to account for a phenomenon in terms of the very phenomenon that it is

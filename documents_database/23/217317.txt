spectral sequences are a generalization of exact sequences and since their introduction by they have become important computational tools particularly in algebraic topology algebraic geometry and homological algebra motivated by problems in algebraic topology jean leray introduced the notion of a sheaf and found himself faced with the problem of computing sheaf cohomology to compute sheaf cohomology leray introduced a computational technique now known as the leray spectral sequence this gave a relation between cohomology groups of a sheaf and cohomology groups of the pushforward of the sheaf the relation involved an infinite process leray found that the cohomology groups of the pushforward formed a natural chain complex so that he could take the cohomology of the cohomology this was still not the cohomology of the original sheaf but it was one step closer in a sense the cohomology of the cohomology again formed a chain complex and its cohomology formed a chain complex and so on the limit of this infinite process was essentially the same as the cohomology groups of the original sheaf it was soon realized that leray s computational technique was an example of a more general phenomenon spectral sequences were found in diverse situations and

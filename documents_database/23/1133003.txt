a liquid that is both denser than water and is immiscible in or does not dissolve in water the term dnapl is used primarily by environmental engineers and hydrogeologists to describe contaminants in groundwater surface water and sediments dnapls tends to sink below the water table when spilled in significant quantities and only stop when they reach impermeable bedrock their penetration into an aquifer makes them difficult to locate and remediate examples of materials that are dnapls when spilled include when spilled into the environment chlorinated solvents are frequently present as dnapl and the dnapl can provide a long term secondary source of the chlorinated solvent to dissolved groundwater plumes chlorinated solvents are typically immiscible in water having low solubility in water by definition yet still have a solubility above the concentrations allowed by drinking water protections therefore dnapl which is a chlorinated solvent can act as an ongoing pathway for constituents to dissolve into groundwater common use of chlorinated solvents in manufacturing operations began during world war ii with the rate of usage for most solvents increasing into the 1970s by the early 1980s chemical analyses becoming available that documented widespread contamination of groundwater with chlorinated solvents since that

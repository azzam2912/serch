its 34 species are generally found in forests from sea level to 4000 m altitude from mexico to argentina the genus was described by jean baptiste christophore fus e aublet in 1775 its name derived from a local name roupale in french guiana in their lawrie johnson and barbara briggs placed it in a subtribe roupalinae alongside the new caledonian genus kermadecia as the genera had similar floral parts and leaves both taxa also have 14 chromosome pairs in 2006 the family s classification was redefined using molecular data here roupala emerged as a sister to the genera orites and neorites with knightia as the next most closely related taxon while kermadecia was not related they thus placed the first three genera in the subtribe roupalinae conceding that the next closest relatives of this group is unclear this group lies within the subfamily grevilleoideae the genus likely originated in gondwana before south america split away around 110 million years ago and then spread into central america in the miocene around six million years ago when the americas came into contact with each other clock dating with molecular and fossil data indicated ancestors of the genus may have split from neorites

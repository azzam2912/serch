lautering usually consists of 3 steps mashout recirculation and sparging mashout is the term for raising the temperature of the mash to this both stops the enzymatic conversion of starches to fermentable sugars and makes the mash and wort more fluid mashout is considered especially necessary if there is less than 3 liters of water per kilogram of grain 3 pints of water per pound of grain or if the grain is more than 25 wheat or oats the mashout step can be done by using external heat or simply by adding hot water recirculation consists of drawing off wort from the bottom of the mash and adding it to the top lauter tuns typically have slotted bottoms to assist in the filtration process the mash itself functions much as a sand filter to capture mash debris and proteins this step is monitored by use of a turbidimeter to measure solids in the wort liquid by their opacity sparging is trickling water through the grain to extract sugars this is a delicate step as the wrong temperature or ph will extract tannins from the chaff grain husks as well resulting in a bitter brew typically 1 5 times more water

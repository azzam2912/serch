this occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate glutamate receptors such as the nmda receptor and ampa receptor are overactivated by glutamatergic storm excitotoxins like nmda and kainic acid which bind to these receptors as well as pathologically high levels of glutamate can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of calcium ions ca to enter the cell ca influx into cells activates a number of enzymes including phospholipases endonucleases and proteases such as calpain these enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton membrane and dna excitotoxicity may be involved in spinal cord injury stroke traumatic brain injury hearing loss through noise overexposure or ototoxicity and in neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system cns such as multiple sclerosis alzheimer s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als parkinson s disease alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal and especially over rapid benzodiazepine withdrawal and also huntington s disease other common conditions that cause excessive glutamate concentrations around neurons are hypoglycemia blood sugars are the primary glutamate removal method from inter synaptic spaces at the nmda and ampa receptor site persons in excitotoxic shock must never fall into hypoglycemia patients should be given 5 glucose dextrose iv drip during

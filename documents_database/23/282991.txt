there are three types of biquaternions corresponding to complex numbers and the variations thereof this article is about the ordinary biquaternions named by william rowan hamilton in 1844 see proceedings of the royal irish academy 1844 1850 page 388 some of the more prominent proponents of these biquaternions include alexander macfarlane arthur w conway ludwik silberstein and cornelius lanczos as developed below the unit quasi sphere of the biquaternions provides a representation of the lorentz group which is the foundation of special relativity the algebra of biquaternions can be considered as a tensor product taken over the reals where is the field of complex numbers and is the division algebra of real quaternions in other words the biquaternions are just the complexification of the quaternions viewed as a complex algebra the biquaternions are isomorphic to the algebra of complex matrices they are also isomorphic to several clifford algebras including the pauli algebra and the even part of the spacetime algebra let be the basis for the real quaternions and let be complex numbers then is a biquaternion to distinguish square roots of minus one in the biquaternions hamilton and arthur w conway used the convention of representing the square root

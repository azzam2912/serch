the systematic name of this enzyme class is cis 3 4 leucopelargonidin nadp 4 oxidoreductase other names in common use include dihydroflavanol 4 reductase dfr dihydromyricetin reductase nadph dihydromyricetin reductase and dihydroquercetin reductase this enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis anthocyanidins common plant pigments are further reduced by the enzyme dihydroflavonol 4 reductase dfr to the corresponding colorless leucoanthocyanidins dfr uses dihydromyricetin ampelopsin nadph and 2 h to produce leucodelphinidin and nadp a cdna for dfr has been cloned from the orchid bromheadia finlaysoniana researchers in japan have genetically manipulated roses by using rna interference to knock out endogenous dfr adding a gene dfr from an iris and adding a gene for the blue pigment delphinidin in an effort to create a blue rose which is being sold worldwide dihydroflavonol 4 reductase is an enzyme part of the lignin biosynthesis pathway in arabidopsis thaliana the enzyme uses sinapaldehyde or coniferyl aldehyde or coumaraldehyde and nadph to produce sinapyl alcohol or coniferyl alcohol or coumaryl alcohol respectively and nadp as of late 2007 two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes with pdb accession codes and

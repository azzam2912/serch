this approach was first recognized when acetylated sugars only acted as glycosyl acceptors when reacted with benzylated sugars the acetylated sugars were termed disarmed while the benzylated sugars were termed armed the selectivity in the reaction is due to the stronger electron withdrawing power of the esters compared to the ethers a stronger electron withdrawing substituent leads to a greater destabilization of the oxocarbenium ion this slows this reaction pathway and allows for disaccharide formation to occur with the benzylated sugar other effective electron withdrawing groups that have shown selectivity are halogens and azido groups while deoxygenation has been proven an effective tool in arming sugars disarming sugars can also be accomplished by adding 1 3 dioxane and 1 3 dioxolane protecting groups onto sugars these protecting groups lock the sugars into a rigid chair conformation when the sugar forms the necessary oxocarbenium ion it flattens at the anomeric position this change in configuration is a high energy transformation when cyclic protecting groups are present and leads to the sugar being disarmed these groups can be easily removed following glycosylation effectively arming the sugar and allowing for control of the glycosylation further work has shown that the effect of 1

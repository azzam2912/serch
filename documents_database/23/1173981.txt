the asteroid was named after russian mathematician nikolai lobachevsky lobachevskij had already been photographed in precovery images dating back to the 1930s providing it with a much larger observation arc it orbits the sun in the central main belt at a distance of 2 5 2 9 au once every 4 years and 5 months 1 620 days its orbit has an eccentricity of 0 08 and an inclination of 2 with respect to the ecliptic first identified as at heidelberg observatory in 1928 the asteroid s first used observations was a precovery taken at palomar observatory in 1954 extending its observation arc by 18 years prior to its official discovery at nauchnyj lobachevskij is a strongly reddish and relatively uncommon l type asteroid in the smass classification it has an absolute magnitude between 11 5 and 12 4 in may 2011 photometric observation of lobachevskij gave a rotation period of 5 413 and 5 435 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0 30 and 0 33 magnitude respectively superseding a previous period of 7 00 hours in september 2012 two rotational lightcurves were obtained in the s and r band at the palomar transient factory in california lightcurve analysis

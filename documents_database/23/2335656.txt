it reflects the ability of artery occluding thrombi to let fluid seep into and through them the more pervious a thrombus the more fluid it lets through thrombus perviousness can be measured using radiological imaging routinely performed in the clinical management of acute ischemic stroke ct scans without intravenous contrast also called non contrast ct in short ncct combined with ct scans after intravenously administered contrast fluid ct angiography in short cta pervious thrombi may let more blood pass through to the ischemic brain tissue and or have a larger contact surface and histopathology more sensitive for thrombolytic medication thus patients with pervious thrombi may have less brain tissue damage by stroke the value of thrombus perviousness in acute ischemic stroke treatment is currently being researched emilie santos et al introduced the term thrombus perviousness in 2016 to estimate thrombus permeability in ischemic stroke patients before mishra et al used residual flow within the clot and fr lich et al used antegrade flow across incomplete vessel occlusions to describe an estimate of thrombus permeability permeability is the physical measure of the ability of a material to transmit fluids over time to measure thrombus permeability one needs to measure contrast flow

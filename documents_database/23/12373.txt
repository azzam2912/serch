the biologist orator f cook coined the term in 1906 for cladogenesis the splitting of lineages as opposed to anagenesis phyletic evolution within lineages charles darwin was the first to describe the role of natural selection in speciation in his 1859 book on the origin of species he also identified sexual selection as a likely mechanism but found it problematic there are four geographic modes of speciation in nature based on the extent to which speciating populations are isolated from one another allopatric peripatric parapatric and sympatric speciation may also be induced artificially through animal husbandry agriculture or laboratory experiments whether genetic drift is a minor or major contributor to speciation is the subject matter of much ongoing discussion rapid sympatric speciation can take place through polyploidy such as by doubling of chromosome number the result is progeny which are immediately reproductively isolated from the parent population new species can also be created through hybridisation followed if the hybrid is favoured by natural selection by reproductive isolation in addressing the question of the origin of species there are two key issues 1 what are the evolutionary mechanisms of speciation and 2 what accounts for the separateness and individuality of species

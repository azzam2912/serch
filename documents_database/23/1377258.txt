according to the dictionary of the fungi 10th edition 2008 the widespread genus contains 386 species graphidaceae is one of the most prevailing species in lichen communities though its classification is not well developed previously the graphidoid members of graphidaceae sensu were divided into the genera graphis graphina phaeographis and phaeographina contingent on if the ascospores are septate or muriform colorless or greyish brown septate in terms of mycology refers to the condition where there is a lack of partition dividing filamentous hyphae into discrete cells in fungi this notion was thought of as synthetic and adjustments of acanthothecis and dyplolabia changed the method to a more natural generic classification of the family a set of characteristics such as excipulum and hamathecium structure ascospore color and iodine reaction and chemistry was suggested to reach a much more sufficient genus model the excipulum is the cup shaped tissue that holds the hymenium asci in the apothecium the hamathecium is the hypha emerging between the asci of the hymenium thallus color thallus cortex vegetative propagules lirella emergence thalline margine of lirella relative length and branching of lirellae disc exposure labia and disc pruinosity labium striation excipulum carbonization hymenium inspersion and ascospores are

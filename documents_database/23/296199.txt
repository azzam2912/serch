phys acta 11 225 describes a massive spin 1 field as an r the real numbers are the lie algebra of u 1 yang mills theory coupled to a real scalar field this scalar field takes on values in a real 1d affine representation of r with m as the coupling strength this is a special case of the higgs mechanism where in effect and thus the mass of the higgs scalar excitation has been taken to infinity so the higgs has decoupled and can be ignored resulting in a nonlinear affine representation of the field instead of a linear representation in contemporary terminology a u 1 nonlinear model gauge fixing 0 yields the proca action this explains why unlike the case for non abelian vector fields quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon is in fact renormalizable even though it is not manifestly gauge invariant after the st ckelberg scalar has been eliminated in the proca action the stueckelberg lagrangian of the stsm stueckelberg extension of the standard model consists of a gauge invariant kinetic term for a massive u 1 gauge field such a term can be implemented into the lagrangian of the standard model without destroying the renormalizability

it is a redox titration in which a fe 1 10 phenanthroline complex ferroin color change indicates the end point ferroin can be reversibly discolored in its oxidized form upon titration with a ce solution the use of cerium iv salts as reagents for volumetric analysis was first proposed in the middle of 19th century but systematic studies did not start until about 70 years later standard solutions can be prepared from different ce salts but often cerium sulfate is chosen since cerimetry is linked to the fe fe redox pair it can be used for analyses of nonstoichiometric levels that either oxidize fe or reduce fe for the case of oxidation a precise excess of high purity crystalline mohr s salt is added upon the oxide digestion in aqueous hydrogen chloride hcl while for the case of reduction an excess of 1 m iron trichloride fecl is added in both cases fe ions will be titrated subsequently because the ce solution is prone to hydrolysis the titration is done in a strongly hcl acidic solution into which some phosphoric acid hpo is added to obtain a less colored phosphato complex of fe according to tabulated values of standard potentials

while inspired by knots which appear in daily life such as those in shoelaces and rope a mathematical knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone the simplest knot being a ring or unknot in mathematical language a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3 dimensional euclidean space r in topology a circle isn t bound to the classical geometric concept but to all of its homeomorphisms two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of r upon itself known as an ambient isotopy these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself knots can be described in various ways given a method of description however there may be more than one description that represents the same knot for example a common method of describing a knot is a planar diagram called a knot diagram any given knot can be drawn in many different ways using a knot diagram therefore a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot a complete algorithmic solution to

ngago binds 5 phosphorylated ssdna of 24 nucleotides gdna to guide it to its target site and will make dna double strand breaks at the gdna site like the crispr cas system ngago was reported to be suitable for genome editing but this has not been replicated in contrast to cas9 the ngago gdna system does not require a protospacer adjacent motif pam ngago was proposed to be useful for genome editing in may 2016 because of the system s high accuracy and efficiency which was said to minimize off target effects the specificity of the gdna is essential as cleavage efficiency is impaired by a single nucleotide mismatch between the guide and target molecules using 5 phosphorylated ssdnas as guide molecules reduces the possibility of cellular oligonucleotides misleading ngago a guide molecule can only be attached to ngago during the expression of the protein once the guide is loaded ngago cannot swap free floating ssdna for its gdna designing synthesizing and adjusting the concentration of ssdnas is easier compared to systems using sgrna the required dosage of ssdna is less than that of a sgrna expression plasmid doubts about the technique were raised on gene editing forums as early

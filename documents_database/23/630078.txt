the clade is defined as all species of dinosaurs more closely related to stegosaurus than huayangosaurus the name stegosauridae is thus a stem based name taken from the well represented genus stegosaurus meaning roofed lizard fossil evidence of stegosaurids dating from the middle jurassic through the early cretaceous have been recovered from north america eurasia and africa on the other hand stegosauridae s sister clade huayangosaurids can be traced only to the middle jurassic the clade stegosauridae is composed of the genera stegosaurus dacentrurus miragaia loricatosaurus and kentrosaurus with the last considered to be at the base of the clade the stegosaurids like all other stegosaurians were quadrupedal herbivores that exhibited the characteristic stegosaurian dorsal dermal plates these large thin erect plates are thought to be aligned parasagittally from the neck to near the end of the tail the end of the tail has pairs of spikes sometimes referred to as a thagomizer although defense thermo regulation and display have been theorized to be the possible functions of these dorsal plates a study of the ontogenetic histology of the plates and spikes suggests that the plates serve different functions at different stages of the stegosaurids life histories the terminal spikes

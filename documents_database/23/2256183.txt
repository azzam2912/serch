in lubrication theory in fluid mechanics a body of liquid is assumed to be a thin film i e considerably thinner in one cartesian direction than in the two directions orthogonal to that that is one of many problems that can be simplified if one can make some assumptions about the length scales that are relevant for the physical system the simplest form of a 2 dimensional thin film equation reads where is the viscosity of the liquid h x y t is the x y and t dependent film thickness and is the interfacial tension between the liquid and the gas phase above it the parameter can also be a function of x and y which is why it has been left inside the differentiation and not included in the numerator of the factor 1 3 the equation can be modified in many ways to fit different situations and the most important of these is the addition of a disjoining pressure h in the equation as in where the function h is usually very small in value for moderate large film thicknesses h and grows very rapidly when h goes very close to zero from the simpler form of

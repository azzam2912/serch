others might turn out to be highly unstable decomposing isomerizing polymerizing rearranging or disproportionating some are thought to exist only briefly as reactive intermediates or in vacuum helium hydride ion some cannot hold together due to steric hindrance tetra tert butylmethane or bond stress tetrahedrane some have no known pathway for synthesis hypercubane some parent compounds have not been or cannot be isolated even though stable structural analogs with substituents have been discovered or synthesized borole hypothetical compounds are often predicted or expected from known compounds such as a families of salts for which the parent acid is not a stable molecule or in which salts form with some cations but not others hypothetical compounds are used in some thought experiments some compounds long regarded as hypothetical have later been isolated ethylene dione was suggested in 1913 and observed spectroscopically in 2015 stability and other properties can be predicted using energy calculations and computational chemistry using the born haber cycle to estimate the heat of formation can be used to determine whether a hypothetical compound is stable however a negative formation enthalpy does not automatically imply the existence of a hypothetical compound the method predicts that nacl is stable but

it can be seen as a reversal of the usual syntax for the calculus where the argument in an application is placed next to its corresponding binder in the function instead of after the latter s body terms formula 1 in the de bruijn notation are either variables formula 2 or have one of two wagon prefixes the abstractor wagon written formula 3 corresponds to the usual binder of the calculus and the applicator wagon written formula 4 corresponds to the argument in an application in the calculus terms in the traditional syntax can be converted to the de bruijn notation by defining an inductive function formula 6 for which formula 7 all operations on terms commute with respect to the formula 6 translation for example the usual reduction in the de bruijn notation is predictably a feature of this notation is that abstractor and applicator wagons of redexes are paired like parentheses for example consider the stages in the reduction of the term formula 11 where the redexes are underlined formula 12 thus if one views the applicator as an open paren codice 1 and the abstractor as a close bracket codice 2 then the pattern in the above

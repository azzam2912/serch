at that time nepal was closed to foreigners so any approach had to be from the north through tibet a feasible route was discovered from the east up the kharta glacier and then crossing the lhakpa la pass north east of everest it was then necessary to descend to the east rongbuk glacier before climbing again to everest s north col however although the north col was reached it was not possible to climb further before the expedition had to withdraw initially the expedition explored from the north and discovered the main rongbuk glacier only to find that it seemed to provide no likely routes to the summit however at the time it was not realised that the east rongbuk glacier actually flowed into the rongbuk glacier it was thought it descended away to the east as a reconnaissance the expedition was a success because it determined that a good route might be to approach the east rongbuk glacier via the rongbuk glacier and then follow the north col route to the summit next year the 1922 british mount everest expedition took this route and was able to climb above the north col although it did not reach the summit

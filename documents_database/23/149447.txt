it has a complex history being first created for patrick de salisbury in the middle twelfth century it was eventually inherited by alice wife of thomas earl of lancaster when the earl of lancaster lost his titles and was executed for treason in 1322 the countess surrendered all of her titles to the king and the titles lapsed the title was created for a second time in 1337 for william montacute of the noble house of montagu this line ended in the sole heiress alice montacute and her husband richard neville took up the earldom by right of his wife complete peerage records xi p 395 note o that parliament agreed to this until the king came of age the question then is whether this was or was not a creation of a new line complete peerage did not think so and treated all earls up to and including margaret plantagenet as part of the one line created in 1337 certainly the earldom was inherited later by richard neville the kingmaker upon whose death the title went into abeyance because multiple individuals were entitled to inherit it however in those days the modern doctrine of abeyance had not been formulated

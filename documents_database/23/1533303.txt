its advantages are a high signal to noise ratio and a high spatial resolution in the vertical dimension total internal reflection of light occurs at the interface between materials of differing indices of refraction at incident angles greater than the critical angle formula 1 where and formula 3 is the index of the incident medium and formula 4 the index of the transmission medium and formula 1 is measured from the normal to the interface under conditions of total internal reflection the electromagnetic field in the transmission medium takes on the form of an evanescent wave whose intensity formula 6 decays exponentially with distance from the interface such that with formula 8 for practical purposes the transmission medium is often chosen to be a fluid usually water in which a microscopic object can be immersed the object when brought close to the interface is expected to scatter light proportional to the intensity of the field at its height formula 9 since the penetration depth of the evanescent field is on the order of hundreds of nanometers this technique is among the most sensitive for tracking displacements in the direction perpendicular to a surface the thin excitation region of an evanescent

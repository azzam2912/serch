in particular he authored pioneering works on synthesis and complexity of boolean circuits and of control systems in general the term used in the ussr and russia for a generalization of finite state automata boolean circuits and multi valued logic circuits ingo wegener in his book the complexity of boolean functions credits o b lupanov for coining the term shannon effect in his 1970 paper to refer to the fact that almost all boolean functions have nearly the same circuit complexity as the hardest function o b lupanov is best known for his k s lupanov representation of boolean functions that he used to devise an asymptotically optimal method of boolean circuit synthesis thus proving the asymptotically tight upper bound on boolean circuit complexity o b lupanov graduated from moscow state university s faculty of mechanics and mathematics in 1955 he received his phd in 1958 from the ussr academy of sciences and his doctorate degree in 1963 he began teaching at moscow state university in 1959 and became professor there in 1967 from 1955 he had appointment at the institute of applied mathematics and he was a professor at faculty of computational mathematics and cybernetics 1970 1980 he had

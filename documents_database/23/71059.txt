it is the most commonly occurring of several aluminium oxides and specifically identified as aluminium iii oxide it is commonly called alumina and may also be called aloxide aloxite or alundum depending on particular forms or applications it occurs naturally in its crystalline polymorphic phase alo as the mineral corundum varieties of which form the precious gemstones ruby and sapphire alo is significant in its use to produce aluminium metal as an abrasive owing to its hardness and as a refractory material owing to its high melting point corundum is the most common naturally occurring crystalline form of aluminium oxide rubies and sapphires are gem quality forms of corundum which owe their characteristic colors to trace impurities rubies are given their characteristic deep red color and their laser qualities by traces of chromium sapphires come in different colors given by various other impurities such as iron and titanium alo is an electrical insulator but has a relatively high thermal conductivity for a ceramic material aluminium oxide is insoluble in water in its most commonly occurring crystalline form called corundum or aluminium oxide its hardness makes it suitable for use as an abrasive and as a component in cutting tools aluminium

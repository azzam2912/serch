in snakes venom has evolved to kill or subdue prey as well as to perform other diet related functions the evolution of venom is thought to be responsible for the enormous expansion of snakes across the globe the evolutionary history of snake venom is a matter of debate the common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today under this hypothesis the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands subsequently this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans including serpentes anguimorpha and iguania several snake lineages subsequently lost the ability to produce venom often due to a change in diet the single origin hypothesis suggests that the mechanism of evolution in most cases has been gene duplication followed by natural selection for adaptive traits some of the various adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages proteins that pre digest prey and a method to track down prey after a bite these various adaptations of venom

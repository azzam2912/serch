reaching as much as in length odontogriphus is a flat oval bilaterian which apparently had a single muscular foot and a shell on its back that was moderately rigid but of a material unsuited to fossilization originally it was known from only one specimen but 189 new finds in the years immediately preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible as a result odontogriphus has become prominent in the debate that has gone on since 1990 about the evolutionary origins of molluscs annelid worms and brachiopods a group of scientists think that odontogriphus s feeding apparatus which is nearly identical to wiwaxia s is an early version of the molluscan radula a chitinous tongue that bears multiple rows of rasping teeth hence they classify odontogriphus and wiwaxia as close to the ancestors of the first true molluscs one scientist has presented a different analysis arguing since 1990 that wiwaxia is not closely related to molluscs but is much more like a polychaete worm he argues that the supposed radula is nothing of the sort he classifies odontogriphus as a basal lophotrochozoan in other words close to the last common ancestor of molluscs annelid worms and brachiopods charles doolittle walcott found one

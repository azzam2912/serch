first observed in synchrotrons synchrotron light is now produced by storage rings and other specialized particle accelerators typically accelerating electrons once the high energy electron beam has been generated it is directed into auxiliary components such as bending magnets and insertion devices undulators or wigglers in storage rings and free electron lasers these supply the strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the beam which are needed to convert high energy electrons into photons the major applications of synchrotron light are in condensed matter physics materials science biology and medicine a large fraction of experiments using synchrotron light involve probing the structure of matter from the sub nanometer level of electronic structure to the micrometer and millimeter level important in medical imaging an example of a practical industrial application is the manufacturing of microstructures by the liga process when comparing x ray sources an important measure of quality of the source is called brilliance brilliance takes into account the resulting formula is the greater the brilliance the more photons of a given wavelength and direction are concentrated on a spot per unit of time in most x ray literature the units for brilliance appear as different areas of science often have different

it goes back to the studies of pierre de fermat on what are now recognized as elliptic curves and has become a very substantial area of arithmetic geometry both in terms of results and conjectures most of these can be posed for an abelian variety a over a number field k or more generally for global fields or more general finitely generated rings or fields there is some tension here between concepts integer point belongs in a sense to affine geometry while abelian variety is inherently defined in projective geometry the basic results such as siegel s theorem on integral points come from the theory of diophantine approximation the basic result the mordell weil theorem in diophantine geometry says that a k the group of points on a over k is a finitely generated abelian group a great deal of information about its possible torsion subgroups is known at least when a is an elliptic curve the question of the rank is thought to be bound up with l functions see below the torsor theory here leads to the selmer group and tate shafarevich group the latter conjecturally finite being difficult to study the theory of heights plays a prominent

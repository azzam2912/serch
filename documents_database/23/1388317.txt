botanists distinguish between true bulbs corms rhizomes tubers and tuberous roots any of which may be termed bulbs in horticulture bulb species usually lose their upper parts during adverse conditions such as summer drought and heat or winter cold the bulb s storage organs contain moisture and nutrients that are used to survive these adverse conditions in a dormant state when conditions become favourable the reserves sustain a new growth cycle in addition bulbs permit vegetative or asexual multiplication in these species ornamental bulbs are used in parks and gardens and as cut flowers the word bulb has a somewhat different meaning to botanists than it does to gardeners and horticulturalists in the context of gardening a bulb is a plant s underground or ground level storage organ that can be dried stored and sold in this state and then planted to grow again many bulbs in this sense are produced by geophytes i e plants whose growing point is below ground level however not all bulbs in the gardening sense are produced by geophytes for example rhizomatous irises are included in books on ornamental bulbs but their growing points are above ground many bulbs are produced by lilioid monocots

some examples of recursively definable objects include factorials natural numbers fibonacci numbers and the cantor ternary set a recursive definition of a function defines values of the function for some inputs in terms of the values of the same function for other usually smaller inputs for example the factorial function n is defined by the rules this definition is valid for each natural number n because the recursion eventually reaches the base case of 0 the definition may also be thought of as giving a procedure for computing the value of the function n starting from n 0 and proceeding onwards with n 1 n 2 n 3 etc the recursion theorem states that such a definition indeed defines a function that is unique the proof uses mathematical induction an inductive definition of a set describes the elements in a set in terms of other elements in the set for example one definition of the set n of natural numbers is there are many sets that satisfy 1 and 2 for example the set 1 1 649 2 2 649 3 3 649 satisfies the definition however condition 3 specifies the set of natural numbers by removing the sets with

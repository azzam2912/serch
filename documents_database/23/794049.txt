the study involves looking at a particular part of the nervous system from a molecular and cellular level and connecting it to a physiological and anatomical point of view the field also explores the communications and interactions within and between each specialized section of the nervous system morphology is distinct from morphogenesis morphology is the study of the shape and structure of biological organisms while morphogenesis is the study of the biological development of the shape and structure of organisms therefore neuromorphology focuses on the specifics of the structure of the nervous system and not the process by which the structure was developed neuromorphology and morphogenesis while two different entities are nonetheless closely linked progress in defining the morphology of nerve cells has been slow in its development it took nearly a century after the acceptance of the cell as the basic unit of life before researchers could agree upon the shape of a neuron it was originally thought to be an independent globular corpuscle suspended along nerve fibers that looped and coiled it was not until the first successful microdissection of a whole nerve cell by otto deiters in 1865 that the separate dendrites and axon could be distinguished

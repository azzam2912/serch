it is the outermost grouping of the data in the data store it resembles the schema concept in relational database management systems generally there is one keyspace per application a keyspace may contain column families or super columns each super column contains one or more column families and each column family contains at least one column the keyspace is the highest abstraction in a distributed data store this is fundamental in preserving the structural heuristics in dynamic data retrieval multiple relay protocol algorithms are integrated within the simple framework the keyspace has similar importance like a schema has in a database in contrast to the schema however it does not stipulate any concrete structure like it is known in the entity relationship model used widely in the relational data models for instance the contents of the keyspace can be column families each having different number of columns or even different columns so the column families that somehow relate to the row concept in relational databases do not stipulate any fixed structure the only point that is the same with a schema is that it also contains a number of objects which are tables in rdbms systems and here column families

this occurs via phase variation of a single dna methyltransferase phase variation of methyltransferase expression results in differential methylation throughout the bacterial genome leading to variable expression of multiple genes through epigenetic mechanisms phasevarions have been identified in several mucosal associated human adapted pathogens which include haemophilus influenzae neisseria meningitidis neisseria gonorrhoeae helicobacter pylori moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae all described phasevarions regulate expression of proteins that are involved in host colonization survival and pathogenesis and many regulate putative vaccine targets the presence of phasevarions complicates identification of stably expressed proteins as the regulated genes do not contain any identifiable features the only way to identify genes in a phasevarion is by detailed study of the organisms containing such systems study of the phasevarions and identification of proteins they regulate is therefore critical to generate effective and stable vaccines many of the phasevarions described to date are controlled by type iii methyltransferases mod genes are the methyltransferase component of type iii restriction modification r m systems in bacteria and serve to protect host dna from the action of the associated restriction enzyme however in many bacterial pathogens mod genes contain simple sequence repeats ssrs and the associated restriction enzyme encoding

in general however the velocity field is not known these algorithms are hence employed to obtain the solution the standard euler equations fluid dynamics can be given by the momentum equations obtained by substituting with standard directional vectors of the velocity field u v and w where formula 4 is the density u v are the x and y directional components of velocity p is the pressure field and s are the source terms these equations are however hard to solve due to quasilinearity in the momentum equations and interdependence of the pressure term in all three equations also for a general purpose flow equation the pressure field is also unknown and is to be solved for as well if the flow field is compressible the above equations act as the standard temperature and density equations and pressure can be found as it is a function of them both if however the flow is in compressible the pressure is independent of density hence coupling is necessary to induce a constraint on the solution the resulting fields will then satisfy the continuity equations both these issues are solved via the application of the simple algorithm and its derivatives for general purpose

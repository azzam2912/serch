these illusions can be extremely dangerous for pilots the vestibular system which is responsible for the sense of balance in humans consists of the otolith organs and the semicircular canals illusions in aviation are caused when the brain cannot reconcile inputs from the vestibular system and visual system the three semicircular canals which recognize accelerations in pitch yaw and roll are stimulated by angular accelerations while the otolith organs the saccule and utricle are stimulated by linear accelerations stimulation of the semicircular canals occurs when movement of the endolymph inside the canals causes movement of the crista ampullaris and the hair cells within them stimulation of the otolith organs occurs when gravitational forces or linear accelerations cause movement of the otolith membrane the otoliths or the hair cells of the macula somatogyral illusions occur as a result of angular accelerations stimulating the semicircular canals somatogravic illusions on the other hand occur as a result of linear accelerations stimulating the otolith organs illusions involving the semicircular and somatogyral canals of the vestibular system of the ear occur primarily under conditions of unreliable or unavailable external visual references and result in false sensations of rotation these include the leans the graveyard spin

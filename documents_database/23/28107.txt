these insects are usually solitary but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits becoming gregarious no taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions these grasshoppers are innocuous their numbers are low and they do not pose a major economic threat to agriculture however under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth serotonin in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes they start to breed abundantly becoming gregarious and nomadic loosely described as migratory when their populations become dense enough they form bands of wingless nymphs which later become swarms of winged adults both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause damage to crops the adults are powerful fliers they can travel great distances consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles locusts have formed plagues since prehistory the ancient egyptians carved them on their tombs and the insects are mentioned in the iliad the bible and the quran swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations more recently changes in

this was originally done with photographic processes to create posters it can now be done photographically or with digital image processing and may be deliberate or an unintended artifact of color quantization the effect may be created deliberately or happen accidentally for artistic effect most image editing programs provide a posterization feature or photographic processes may be used unwanted posterization also known as banding may occur when the color depth sometimes called bit depth is insufficient to accurately sample a continuous gradation of color tone as a result a continuous gradient appears as a series of discrete steps or bands of color hence the name when discussing fixed pixel displays such as lcd and plasma televisions this effect is referred to as false contouring additionally compression in image formats such as jpeg can also result in posterization when a smooth gradient of colour or luminosity is compressed into discrete quantized blocks with stepped gradients the result may be compounded further by an optical illusion called the mach band illusion in which each band appears to have an intensity gradient in the direction opposing the overall gradient this problem may be resolved in part with dithering posterization is a process in

they were deposited in a series of triassic basins approximately 190 million years ago as north america separated from africa the exposures extend from nova scotia to north carolina related basins are also found underwater in the bay of fundy the group is named for the city of newark new jersey the newark supergroup consists largely of poorly sorted nonmarine sediments typical rocks are breccia conglomerate arkose sandstone siltstone and shale most of the strata are red beds that feature ripple marks mud cracks and even rain drop prints dinosaur footprints are common though actual body fossils are very rare some of the strata are detailed to the level of varves with indications of milankovitch cycles in preserved lake sediments semionotus fossils are especially common the newark sediments are extremely thick up to 6 kilometers they were deposited in a series of half grabens that were themselves faulted into block mountains the beds dip to the east while the faults dip westward the beds are intruded by numerous dikes and sills indicative of considerable igneous activity a superb example is the new jersey palisades sill the newark supergroup s lithologies and structure are the classic hallmarks of a rift valley

the megasporangia each produce a single megaspore in being heterosporus with endosporic gametophytes they are more similar to seed plants than to other ferns the fertile and sterile leaves are dimorphic taking on a different shape and leaves bear anastomosing veins aerenchyma is frequently present in roots shoots and petioles leaf stalks the ferns of this order vary radically in form from one another and do not look particularly fern like species of the family salviniaceae are natant floating while those of the family marsileaceae are rooted however the natant species may temporarily grow on wet mud during times of low water and the marsileaceae may grow as emergent species depending on species and location the group has also the smallest known genomes of all ferns one genus azolla is amongst the fastest growing plants on earth and caused a cooling of the climate in the azolla event about 50 million years ago there is a well known fossil member of the marsileales hydropteris incertae sedis in the molecular phylogenetic classification of smith et al in 2006 the salviniales were placed in the leptosporangiate ferns class polypodiopsida two families marsileaceae and salviniaceae were recognized the linear sequence of christenhusz et

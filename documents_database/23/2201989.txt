it is known from a single specimen that consists of a partial skull ribs partial pelvis leg and other assorted skeletal elements the holotype of murusraptor is estimated to be but is considered to be an immature specimen as the cranial sutures in its braincase have not yet disappeared this indicates it would have been potentially larger analysis of the skeleton further revealed anatomical features as yet unseen in megaraptora particularly in the skull and hips analysis of the posterior of the skull indicates that possibly like the related megaraptor murusraptor likely had an elongated and narrow snout the sacral ribs are hollow coria currie established some distinguishing traits of murusraptor the front branch of the lacrimal is longer than the descending branch is high in the lower jaw the surangular shows a bone shelf at its outer side under the groove between the front surangular opening and the notch for the upper rear branch of the dentary contributing to the side joint the sacral ribs are hollow and tube like the ischia are short transversely flattened and vertically slightly widened these last two traits are unequivocal autapomorphies unique derived qualities as they are unique within the entire theropoda furthermore

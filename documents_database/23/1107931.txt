this enzyme catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of a single strand of dna which lets the broken strand rotate around the intact strand thus altering the topology of dna this gene is localized to chromosome 20 and has pseudogenes which reside on chromosomes 1 and 22 as reviewed by champoux the type ib topoisomerases including top1 form a covalent intermediate in which the active site tyrosine becomes attached to the 3 phosphate end of the cleaved strand rather than the 5 phosphate end the eukaryotic topoisomerases i were found to nick the dna with a preference for a sequence of nucleotides that extends from positions 4 to 1 from the nick the preferred nucleotides in the strand to be cut are 5 a t g c a t t 3 with the enzyme covalently attached to the 1 t residue though sometimes a c residue is found at the 1 position the top1 protein of humans has been subdivided into four regions the n terminal 214 amino acids are dispensable for relaxation of supercoiling activity in vitro and there are four nuclear localization signals and sites for interaction with other cellular proteins within the n terminal domain the n

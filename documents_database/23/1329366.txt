the chinese remainder theorem crt states that for a given system of simultaneous congruence equations the solution is unique in some with under some appropriate conditions on the congruences secret sharing can thus use the crt to produce the shares presented in the congruence equations and the secret could be recovered by solving the system of congruences to get the unique solution which will be the secret to recover there are several types of secret sharing schemes the most basic types are the so called threshold schemes where only the cardinality of the set of shares matters in other words given a secret s and n shares any set of t shares is a set with the smallest cardinality from which the secret can be recovered in the sense that any set of t 1 shares is not enough to give s this is known as a threshold access structure we call such schemes t n threshold secret sharing schemes or t out of n scheme threshold secret sharing schemes differ from one another by the method of generating the shares starting from a certain secret the first ones are shamir s threshold secret sharing scheme which is based on

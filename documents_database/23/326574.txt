high raise is not one of the most spectacular mountains in the district however with a height of 762 metres 2 500 ft it is the highest point in the central fells of lakeland high raise is in fact commonly regarded as the most central mountain in the district and this position gives a fine viewpoint to admire the surrounding mountains and beyond all of england s 3 000 foot 914 m mountains skiddaw helvellyn and the scafells can be well seen from the summit while the more distant views include the three peaks in the yorkshire dales 37 miles 60 km and morecambe bay 25 miles 40 km the summit itself which is also known as high white stones due to a smattering of grey boulders in the vicinity of the highest point has an ordnance survey column and a large cairn which also doubles as a wind shelter a ruined fence also crosses the summit plateau the view is extensive as befits the central location with all major fell groups visible the only disappointment is the langdale pikes which seen from behind lack most of their distinctiveness no lakes are seen other than short sections of bassenthwaite lake

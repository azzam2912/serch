drilling risers are categorised into two types marine drilling risers used with subsea blowout preventer bop and generally used by floating drilling vessels and tie back drilling risers used with a surface bop and generally deployed from fixed platforms or very stable floating platforms like a spar or tension leg platform tlp a marine drilling riser has a large diameter low pressure main tube with external auxiliary lines that include high pressure choke and kill lines for circulating fluids to the subsea blowout preventer bop and usually power and control lines for the bop the design and operation of marine drilling risers is complex and the requirement for high reliability means an extensive amount of engineering analysis is required when used in water depths greater than about 20 meters the marine drilling riser has to be tensioned to maintain stability a marine riser tensioner located on the drilling platform provides a near constant tension force adequate to maintain the stability of the riser in the offshore environment the level of tension required is related to the weight of the riser equipment the buoyancy of the riser the forces from waves and currents the weight of the internal fluids and an

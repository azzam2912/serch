holographic displays are distinguished from other forms of 3d imaging in that they do not require the aid of any special glasses or external equipment for a viewer to see the image 1947 hungarian scientist dennis gabor first came up with the concept of a hologram while trying to improve the resolution of electron microscopes he derived the name for holography with holos being the greek word for whole and gramma which is the term for message 1960 the world s first laser was developed by russian scientists nikolay basov and alexander prokhorov and american scientist charles h townes this was a major milestone for holography because laser technology serves as the basis of some modern day holographic displays 1962 yuri denisyuk invented the white light reflection hologram which was the first hologram that could be viewed under the light given off by an ordinary incandescent light bulb 1968 white light transmission holography was invented by stephen benton this type of holography was unique because it was able to reproduce the entire spectrum of colors by separating the seven colors that create white light 1972 lloyd cross produced the first traditional hologram by using white light transmission holography to recreate

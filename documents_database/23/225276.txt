first the code within the block is executed and then the condition is evaluated if the condition is truth true the code within the block is executed again this repeats until the condition becomes false logic false because do while loops check the condition after the block is executed the control structure is often also known as a post test loop contrast with the while loop which tests the condition before the code within the block is executed the do while loop is an exit condition loop this means that the code must always be executed first and then the expression or test condition is evaluated if it is true the code executes the body of the loop again this process is repeated as long as the expression evaluates to true if the expression is false the loop terminates and control transfers to the statement following the do while loop in other words whereas a while loop sets the truth of a statement as a condition precedent for the code s execution a do while loop provides for the action s ongoing execution subject to defeasance by the condition s falsity which falsity i e the truth of the condition

it is a sharper bound than the known first or second moment based tail bounds such as markov s inequality or chebyshev s inequality which only yield power law bounds on tail decay however the chernoff bound requires that the variates be independent a condition that neither markov s inequality nor chebyshev s inequality require although chebyshev s inequality does require the variates to be pairwise independent it is related to the historically prior bernstein inequalities and to hoeffding s inequality the generic chernoff bound for a random variable is attained by applying markov s inequality to for every formula 1 when is the sum of random variables we get for any t 0 in particular optimizing over t and using the assumption that are independent we obtain similarly and so specific chernoff bounds are attained by calculating formula 6 for specific instances of the basic variables formula 7 let be independent bernoulli random variables whose sum is each having probability p 1 2 of being equal to 1 for a bernoulli variable so for any formula 10 taking formula 11 and formula 12 gives and the generic chernoff bound gives the probability of simultaneous occurrence of more than n

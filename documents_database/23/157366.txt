inerted fuel tanks may be used on land or aboard ships or aircraft three elements are required to initiate and sustain combustion an ignition source heat fuel and oxygen combustion may be prevented by reducing any one of these three elements if the presence of an ignition source can not be prevented within a fuel tank then the tank may be made non ignitable by at present flammable vapors in fuel tanks are rendered inert by replacing the air in the tank with an inert gas such as nitrogen nitrogen enriched air steam or carbon dioxide this reduces the oxygen concentration of the ullage to below the combustion threshold alternate methods based on reducing the ullage fuel air ratio to below the lfl or increasing the fuel air ratio to above the ufl have also been proposed oil tankers fill the empty space above the oil cargo with inert gas to prevent fire or explosion of hydrocarbon vapors oil vapors cannot burn in air with less than 11 oxygen content the inert gas may be supplied by cooling and scrubbing the flue gas produced by the ship s boilers where diesel engines are used the exhaust gas may contain too

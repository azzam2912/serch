with a lower drag coefficient than most contemporary designs it allowed high speeds it also allowed significant lift at low angles of attack its use ended almost immediately following world war two in the summer of 1937 reuben h fleet president of consolidated aircraft met with david r davis davis was a freelance aeronautical engineer who was looking for development funds for his wing design the fluid foil davis had designed the wing in reverse starting with a basic low drag teardrop shape and then modifying it to provide lift in comparison with conventional designs davis s design was relatively thick having a short chord while still being deep enough to allow a high aspect ratio davis claimed the new wing would offer reduced drag over designs then in use and would offer considerable lift even at a small angle of attack additionally the thickness of the wing provided space for fuel storage or even embedding engines an idea that was in vogue at the time he approached consolidated to license it for their large flying boats the ability to generate lift at low angles of attack made it particularly interesting for use in flying boats as it would reduce

one of the most prominent examples of such a separation occurs in central north america especially texas oklahoma and kansas where the moist air from the gulf of mexico meets dry air from the desert south western states the dry line is an important factor in severe weather frequency in the great plains of north america it typically lies north south across the high plains states in the warm sector of an extratropical cyclone and stretches into the canadian prairies during the spring and early summer the dry line is also important for severe convective storms in other regions of the world such as northern india in general thunderstorms and other forms of severe weather occur on the moist side of the dryline near the surface warm dry air is more dense than warm moist air of lesser or similar temperature and thus the warm dry air wedges under the moist air like a cold front at higher altitudes the warm moist air is less dense than the cooler drier air and the boundary slope reverses contradicts last sentence please clarify in the vicinity of the reversal aloft severe weather is possible especially when a triple point is formed with

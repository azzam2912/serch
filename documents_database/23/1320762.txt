during this time the design was also occasionally used for engines with four or more cylinders the split single uses a two stroke cycle i e where every downward stroke produces power with the following phases the advantage of the split single engine compared to a conventional two stroke engine is that the split single can give better exhaust scavenging while minimising the loss of unburnt fresh fuel air charge through the exhaust port as a consequence a split single engine can deliver better economy and may run better at small throttle openings a disadvantage of the split single is that for only a marginal improvement over a single cylinder engine a split single engine is larger heavier and more expensive since a manufacturer could produce a conventional two cylinder engine at similar cost to a split single engine a two cylinder engine is usually a more space and cost effective design most engines used a single combustion chamber i e two cylinders however some engines used two combustion chambers i e four cylinders or more initial designs of split single engines from 1905 1939 used a single y shaped or v shaped connecting rod externally these engines appeared very

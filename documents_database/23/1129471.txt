proteins belonging to this family play a central role in inducible gene transcription during the immune response this protein regulates gene expression induced by osmotic stress in mammalian cells unlike monomeric members of this protein family this protein exists as a homodimer and forms stable dimers with dna elements multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene tissues that comprise the kidneys skin and eyes are often subjected to osmotic stresses when the extracellular environment is hypertonic cells lose water and consequently shrink to counteract this cells increase their sodium uptake in order to lose less water however an increase in intracellular ionic concentration is harmful to the cell cells can alternatively synthesize enzymes and transporters that increase intracellular concentration of organic osmolytes which are less toxic than excess ions but which also aid in water retention under conditions of hyperosmolarity nfat5 is synthesized and accumulates in the nucleus nfat5 stimulates the transcription of genes for aldose reductase ar the sodium chloride betaine cotransporter slc6a12 the sodium myo inositol cotransporter slc5a3 the taurine transporter slc6a6 and neuropathy target esterase which are involved in the production and uptake of organic osmolytes additionally nfat5 induces heat shock proteins

p coatneyi occurs in southeast asia the natural host of this species is the rhesus macaque macaca mulatta and crab eating macaque macaca fascicularis fascicularis but there has been no evidence that zoonosis of p coatneyi can occur through its vector the female anopheles mosquito while p coatneyi cannot be transmitted to humans it is similar enough to plasmodium falciparum to warrant laboratory study as a model species plasmodium coatneyi was first discovered in 1961 by dr don eyles in the malaysian state of selangor plasmodium coatneyi was isolated from an anopheles hackeri before being found in its primate host species this was the first occurrence of acquiring a new form of malaria through its vector instead of an infected host specimen the sample was first thought to be plasmodium knowlesi due to the morphological similarities of the two species but was later identified as separate due to having a tertiary periodicity compared to p knowlesi s quartan periodicity the presence of p coatneyi in a host was confirmed in 1963 by dr eyles and his team when the protozoan was discovered in a crab eating monkey found in the same area selangor and again in a separate crab eating

he described how a very large planet as large as jupiter for example would cause its parent star to wobble slightly as the two objects orbit around their center of mass he predicted that the small doppler shifts to the light emitted by the star caused by its continuously varying radial velocity would be detectable by the most sensitive spectrographs as tiny redshifts and blueshifts in the star s emission however the technology of the time produced radial velocity measurements with errors of 1 000 m s or more making them useless for the detection of orbiting planets the expected changes in radial velocity are very small jupiter causes the sun to change velocity by about 12 4 m s over a period of 12 years and the earth s effect is only 0 1 m s over a period of 1 year so long term observations by instruments with a very high resolution are required advances in spectrometer technology and observational techniques in the 1980s and 1990s produced instruments capable of detecting the first of many new extrasolar planets the elodie spectrograph installed at the haute provence observatory in southern france in 1993 could measure radial velocity shifts as

glycerone phosphate outdated to sn glycerol 3 phosphate glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase serves as a major link between carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism it is also a major contributor of electrons to the electron transport chain in the mitochondria older terms for glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase include alpha glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase alphagpdh and glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase gpdh however glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase is not the same as glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh whose substrate is an aldehyde not an alcohol gpdh plays a major role in lipid biosynthesis through the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glycerol 3 phosphate gpdh allows the prompt dephosphorylation of glycerol 3 phosphate into glycerol additionally gpdh is one of the enzymes involved in maintaining the redox potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane the nad nadh coenzyme couple act as an electron reservoir for metabolic redox reactions carrying electrons from one reaction to another most of these metabolism reactions occur in the mitochondria to regenerate nad for further use nadh pools in the cytosol must be reoxidized since the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to both nadh and nad these cannot be freely exchanged between the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix one way to shuttle this reducing

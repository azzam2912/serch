the bipolar of a subset is the polar of formula 5 but lies in formula 3 not formula 7 there are at least three competing definitions of the polar of a set originating in projective geometry and convex analysis in each case the definition describes a duality between certain subsets of a dual pair of topological vector spaces formula 8 the polar cone of a convex cone formula 9 is the set this definition gives a duality on points and hyperplanes writing the latter as the intersection of two oppositely oriented half spaces the polar hyperplane of a point formula 11 is the locus formula 12 the dual relationship for a hyperplane yields that hyperplane s polar point some authors confusingly call a dual cone the polar cone we will not follow that convention in this article the polar of a set formula 9 is the set this is an affine shift of the geometric definition it has the useful characterization that the functional analytic polar of the unit ball in formula 3 is precisely the unit ball in formula 16 some authors include absolute values around the inner product the two definitions coincide for circled sets

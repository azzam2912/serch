a program transformation is any operation that changes the computational structure such as nature and type of computational models their interconnections sequencing of operations keeping the input output behavior intact we basically use operation reduction to reduce the number of operations to be done to perform a task which reduces the hardware required and in turn power consumption for example in a given application specific ic reducing the number of independent additions required automatically reduces the adders required and also the power consumed operation substitution is one of the operation reduction techniques where certain costly operations are substituted by relatively cheaper operations which reduce power consumption some typical examples of operation substitution techniques are given as follows a popular example of operation substitution is butterfly example in this example we need to compute two values y a x a x y a x a x which can be done sequentially computing the terms as shown in the expressions but using operation substitution we can compute them using expressions y a x x x a a y a x x x a a where the term x x once computed can be used by both the computations from this we can

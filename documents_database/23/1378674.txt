it was designed and manufactured by the lavochkin design bureau from 1946 usaf reporting name type 6 aircraft 160 was an all metal pod and boom style aircraft with tri cycle undercarriage like the lavochkin la 152 but its mid set wings incorporated 35 sweep at 1 4 chord the afterburning engine was underslung in the nose with the air intake at the extreme nose and exhaust under the rear fuselage the tricycle undercarriage was housed entirely within the fuselage almost all lavochkin jet aircraft had a similar undercarriage arrangement when retracted allowing the wing to be built thinner and lighter a conventional tail layout with 35 swept tailplane was located at the end of the tail boom the swept wings were of very low taper almost constant chord with 1 2 span flaps ailerons and two wing fences each side although designed as a fighter aircraft 160 was intended for research into high speed swept wing flight of which little was known in the mid 1940s following closely the layout of his previous jet fighter prototypes lavochkin was able to produce an aircraft capable of providing useful data and experience of high speed flight near the speed of sound

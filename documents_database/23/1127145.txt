ballard born june 16 1945 florence south carolina is an american ceramicist based in greenville south carolina much of her work is characterized by the organic earthenware forms of closed containers pinch pots platters pods teapots totems small work vessels and a series she refers to as her white work much of her work is finished with terra sigillata alice considers her art to be a reflection of her relationship with natural forms it is often the metamorphosis of nature s forms as they change from season to season that attracts her to that universal world in which differing life forms share similar qualities her aesthetic heavily references the mother child germination metaphor and also explores the more evocative realm of wonder and awe ballard received her bs degree in design and mfa in painting from the university of michigan in 1968 it is evident that her background in painting comes heavily into play during surface decoration with her ceramics munn uses the pods as a three dimensional canvas using terra sigallata because it reminds her much more of paint whereas glaze really sits on top like icing on the cake she really wanted to emphasize the cake from 1974

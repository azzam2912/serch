it is functionally associated with the glossopharyngeal nerve and innervates the parotid gland for salivation it is one of four parasympathetic ganglia of the head and neck the others are the ciliary ganglion the submandibular ganglion and the pterygopalatine ganglion the otic ganglion is a small 2 3 mm oval shaped flattened parasympathetic ganglion of a reddish grey color located immediately below the foramen ovale in the infratemporal fossa and on the medial surface of the mandibular nerve it is in relation laterally with the trunk of the mandibular nerve at the point where the motor and sensory roots join medially with the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube and the origin of the tensor veli palatini posteriorly with the middle meningeal artery it surrounds the origin of the nerve to the medial pterygoid laterally mandibular nerve the preganglionic parasympathetic fibres originate in the inferior salivatory nucleus of the glossopharyngeal nerve they leave the glossopharyngeal nerve by its tympanic branch and then pass via the tympanic plexus and the lesser petrosal nerve to the otic ganglion here the fibres synapse and the postganglionic fibers pass by communicating branches to the auriculotemporal nerve which conveys them to the parotid gland they

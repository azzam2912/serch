according to the specific definition of center taken into consideration an object might have no center if geometry is regarded as the study of isometry groups then a center is a fixed point of all the isometries which move the object onto itself the center of a circle is the point equidistant from the points on the edge similarly the center of a sphere is the point equidistant from the points on the surface and the center of a line segment is the midpoint of the two ends for objects with several symmetries the center of symmetry is the point left unchanged by the symmetric actions so the center of a square rectangle rhombus or parallelogram is where the diagonals intersect this being amongst other properties the fixed point of rotational symmetries similarly the center of an ellipse or a hyperbola is where the axes intersect several special points of a triangle are often described as triangle centers for an equilateral triangle these are the same point which lies at the intersection of the three axes of symmetry of the triangle one third of the distance from its base to its apex a strict definition of a triangle center is

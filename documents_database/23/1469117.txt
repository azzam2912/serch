the initial state provided as input to the forecast must consist of data values for a range of prognostic meteorological fields that is those fields which determine the future evolution of the model spatially varying fields are required in the form used by the model for example at each intersection point on a regular grid of longitude and latitude circles and initial data must be valid at a single time that corresponds to the present or the recent past by contrast the available observational data usually do not include all of the model s prognostic fields and may include other additional fields these data also have different spatial distribution from the forecast model grid are valid over a range of times rather than a single time and are also subject to observational error the technique of data assimilation is therefore used to produce an analysis of the initial state which is a best fit of the numerical model to the available data taking into account the errors in the model and the data in addition to initializing operational forecasts the analyses themselves are a valuable tool for subsequent meteorological and climatological studies however an operational analysis dataset i e the

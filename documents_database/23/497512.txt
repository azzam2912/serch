it notes the angular height of an astronomical object above the horizon at culmination meridian altitude is the simplest calculation of celestial navigation in which an observer determines his latitude by measuring the altitude of an astronomical object at the time of its meridian contact a meridian contact is the moment when the object contacts the observer s meridian i e the imaginary line running north south and through the zenith nadir and celestial poles this is usually done with the equinox sun at solar noon to determine the observer s latitude but can be done with any celestial object solar noon is the time when the sun contacts the meridian imagine that the equinox sun is overhead at the zenith at a point on the equator latitude 0 and observer a is standing at this point the subsolar point if he were to measure the height of the sun above the horizon with a sextant he would find that the altitude of the sun was 90 by subtracting this figure from 90 he would find that the zenith distance of the sun is 0 which is the same as his latitude if observer b is standing at one of

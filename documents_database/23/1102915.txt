the earliest tai settlements in thailand were in the river valleys in the northern reaches of the country eventually the tai settled the central plains of thailand which were covered with dense rainforest and displaced and inter bred with the pre existing austroasiatic population the languages and culture of the tai eventually came to dominate the regions of both modern day laos and thailand in more recent times many of the tai tribes of laos also migrated west across the border establishing communities in thailand the laotian tai ethnic groups often referred to as the lao are largely clustered in the isan region of thailand comparative linguistic research seems to indicate that the tai people were a proto tai kadai speaking culture of southern china and like the malayo polynesians they may originally have been of austronesian descent prior to living in mainland china the tai are thought to have migrated from a homeland on the island of taiwan where they spoke a dialect of proto austronesian or one of its descendant languages unlike the malayo polynesian group who later sailed south to the philippines and other parts of maritime southeast asia the ancestors of the modern tai kadai people

it was discovered by henry w gould in 1972 the greatest common divisors of the binomial coefficients forming each of the two triangles in the star of david shape in pascal s triangle are equal rows 8 9 and 10 of pascal s triangle are for n 9 k 3 or n 9 k 6 the element 84 is surrounded by in sequence the elements 28 56 126 210 120 36 taking alternating values we have gcd 28 126 120 2 gcd 56 210 36 the element 36 is surrounded by the sequence 8 28 84 120 45 9 and taking alternating values we have gcd 8 84 45 1 gcd 28 120 9 the above greatest common divisor also equals formula 2 thus in the above example for the element 84 in its rightmost appearance we also have gcd 70 56 28 8 2 this result in turn has further generalizations the two sets of three numbers which the star of david theorem says have equal greatest common divisors also have equal products for example again observing that the element 84 is surrounded by in sequence the elements 28 56 126 210 120 36 and again taking alternating values

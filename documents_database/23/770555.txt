likewise a virtual knot can be considered an equivalence of virtual knot diagrams that are equivalent under generalized reidemeister moves a virtual knot diagram is a 4 valent planar graph but each vertex is now allowed to be a classical crossing or a new type called virtual the generalized moves show how to manipulate such diagrams to obtain an equivalent diagram one move called the semi virtual move involves both classical and virtual crossings but all the other moves involve only one variety of crossing virtual knot itself is a fascinating object virtual knots have many exciting connections with other fields of knots theory one of the most important reason why we need virtual knots is as follows the original jones polynomial was defined for 1 links in the 3 sphere the 3 ball the 3 space r3 can you define the jones polynomial for 1 links in any 3 manifold see section 1 1 of this paper kos for the background and the history of this problem kauffman submitted a solution in the case of the product manifold of closed oriented surface and the closed interval by introducing virtual 1 knots it is open in the other cases witten

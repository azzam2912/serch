the term spiralia is applied to those phyla that exhibit canonical spiral cleavage a pattern of early development found in most but not all members of the lophotrochozoa members of the molluscs annelids platyhelminths and nemerteans have all been shown to exhibit spiral cleavage in its classical form other spiralian phyla rotifers brachiopods phoronids gastrotrichs and bryozoans are also said to display a derived form of spiral cleavage in at least a portion of their constituent species although evidence for this is sparse previously spiral cleavage was thought to be unique to the spiralia in the strictest sense animals such as molluscs and annelids which exhibit classical spiral cleavage the presence of spiral cleavage in animals such as platyhelminths could be difficult to correlate with some phylogenies evidence of the relationship between molluscs annelids and lophophorates was found in 1995 more recent research has established the lophotrochozoa as a superphylum within the metazoa with this understanding the presence of spiral cleavage in polyclad platyhelminths as well as the more traditional spiralia has led to the hypothesis that spiral cleavage was present ancestrally across the lophotrochozoa as a whole with the introduction of platytrochozoa and rouphozoa the cladogram is as follows

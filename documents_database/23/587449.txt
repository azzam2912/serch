type c has 7 rna segments and encodes 9 proteins while types a and b have 8 rna segments and encode at least 10 proteins influenza viruses are members of the family orthomyxoviridae influenza viruses a b c and d represent the four antigenic types of influenza viruses of the four antigenic types influenza a virus is the most severe influenza b virus is less severe but can still cause outbreaks and influenza c virus is usually only associated with minor symptoms influenza d virus is 50 similar in amino acid composition to influenza c virus similar to the level of divergence between types a and b while types c and d have a much greater level of divergence from types a and b influenza viruses c and d were estimated to have diverged from a single ancestor over 1 500 years ago around 482 ad influenza a virus can infect a variety of animals as well as humans and its natural host or reservoir is birds whereas influenza viruses b c and d do not have animal reservoirs influenza c virus is not as easily isolated so less information is known of this type but studies show that it

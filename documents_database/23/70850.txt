it consists of finding in a weighted bipartite graph a matching of a given size in which the sum of weights of the edges is a minimum a common variant consists of finding a maximum weight matching this is a specialization of the maximum weight matching problem in which the input graph is bipartite in its most general form the problem is as follows if the numbers of agents and tasks are equal then the problem is called balanced assignment otherwise it is called unbalanced assignment if the total cost of the assignment for all tasks is equal to the sum of the costs for each agent or the sum of the costs for each task which is the same thing in this case then the problem is called linear assignment commonly when speaking of the assignment problem without any additional qualification then the linear balanced assignment problem is meant suppose that a taxi firm has three taxis the agents available and three customers the tasks wishing to be picked up as soon as possible the firm prides itself on speedy pickups so for each taxi the cost of picking up a particular customer will depend on the time taken

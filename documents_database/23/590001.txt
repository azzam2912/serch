folk an influential sedimentary petrologist and professor emeritus at the university of texas folk s philosophy is that the name of a rock must convey as much information as possible without being a complete description for this he proposed five important properties of sandstones to use as defining characteristics these five properties are grain size chemically precipitated cements textural maturity miscellaneous transported constituents and clan designation folk s fivefold name must be in the following format however folk stated that cements and miscellaneous transported constituents are optional categories as they are not always observed the other three properties should always be mentioned the following are examples of rock names using folk s fivefold name as others before him folk proposed a classification for sandstones based on the relative abundances of quartz q feldspars f and rock fragments r these are the main poles of the classification diagram to define the clan name one must normalize the sum of abundances of quartz feldspars and rock fragments to 100 this means that other constituents that don t fit in these categories are disregarded after this the relative percentages of quartz feldspars and rock fragments are used to plot the appropriate point on

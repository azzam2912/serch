the b21 and all derived engines are often referred to as red block engines for the red paint applied to the block the primary differences when compared to the b20 was the switch to a sohc in place of the older pushrod configuration and an aluminum crossflow cylinder head versus the iron head of the b20 initially the overhead camshaft versions were offered as optional equipment on the 240 becoming standard in all markets by the 1976 model year the overhead camshaft motors were available in displacements of 2 0 b19 and b200 2 1 b21 and eventually 2 3 b23 and b230 litres the b21 featured an stroke and bore in the us the b21 s power output ranged anywhere between and based on variations in the compression ratio and was typically supplied with a b or m camshaft the engines are tilted approx 15 degrees to left exhaust side to make room for the more complicated injection systems b19 and b21 blocks can be identified by water plugs on one side of the block the b23 blocks have them on both sides the camshaft is driven by a toothed belt that is driven off the front of the

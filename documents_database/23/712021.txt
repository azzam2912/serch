there are at least two definitions of squircle in use the most common of which is based on the superellipse the word squircle is a portmanteau of the words square and circle squircles have been applied in design and optics in a cartesian coordinate system the superellipse is defined by the equation where r and r are the semi major and semi minor axes a and b are the x and y coordinates of the center of the ellipse and n is a positive number the squircle can be defined as the superellipse with r r and n 4 its equation is where r is the minor radius of the squircle compare this to the equation of a circle when the squircle is centered at the origin then a b 0 and it is called lam s special quartic in terms of the p norm formula 3 on formula 4 the squircle can be expressed as where p 4 formula 6 is the vector denoting the center of the squircle and formula 7 effectively this is still a circle of points at a distance r from the center but distance is defined differently for comparison the usual circle is the

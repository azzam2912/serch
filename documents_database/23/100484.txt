these types of misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations are usually avoided through the use of detailed critical path schedules which specify the work and timetable to be used but most importantly the logical sequence of events which must occur for a project to be completed delays in construction projects are frequently expensive since there is usually a construction loan involved which charges interest management staff dedicated to the project whose costs are time dependent and ongoing inflation in wage and material prices however in more complex projects problems will arise that are not foreseen in the original contract and so other legal construction forms are subsequently used such as change orders lien waivers and addenda in construction projects as well in other projects where a schedule is being used to plan work delays happen all the time it is what is being delayed that determines if a project or some other deadline such as a milestone will be completed late before analyzing construction delays a clear understanding of the general types of delays is necessary there are four basic ways to categorize delays before determining the impact of a delay on the project one must determine whether the delay is critical

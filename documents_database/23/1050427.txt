every subset of an element of the ideal must also be in the ideal this codifies the idea that an ideal is a notion of smallness and the union of any two elements of the ideal must also be in the ideal more formally given a set x an ideal i on x is a nonempty subset of the powerset of x such that 1 formula 1 2 if formula 2 and formula 3 then formula 4 and 3 if formula 5 then formula 6 some authors add a third condition that x itself is not in i ideals with this extra property are called proper ideals ideals in the set theoretic sense are exactly ideals in the order theoretic sense where the relevant order is set inclusion also they are exactly ideals in the ring theoretic sense on the boolean ring formed by the powerset of the underlying set an element of an ideal i is said to be i null or i negligible or simply null or negligible if the ideal i is understood from context if i is an ideal on x then a subset of x is said to be i positive or just positive if

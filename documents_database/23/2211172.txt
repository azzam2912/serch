a single pts permease of the l asc family of pts permeases has been functionally characterized this is the sgatba system renamed ulaabc utilization of l ascorbate by yew and gerlt the sgatba permease consists of three proteins sgat sgab and sgaa sgat is a 12 tms protein possibly very distantly related to the mfs hexuronate permease of escherichia coli tc 2 a 1 14 2 which presumably functions as a pts iic protein this gene product as well as sgab and sgaa are all essential for anaerobic l ascorbate utilization transport and phosphorylation this is the first documented example where the two sugar specific energy coupling proteins of a pts permease are more closely related to the proteins of two different families the sga regulation is controlled by the nearby yjfq repressor homologues of sgat like other pts protein homologues have been identified in a large number of evolutionarily divergent bacteria but not in archaea or eukaryotes bacteria that encode sgat homologues include numerous gram negative proteobacteria as well as many low and high g c gram positive bacteria except for species of corynebacterium streptomyces and bacillus almost all organisms possessing sgatba homologues are human animal pathogens several organisms

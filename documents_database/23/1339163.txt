fossils have been registered from the early carboniferous period the genus contains only one species u anastasiae recovered from deposits of tournaisian to vis an stages in kazakhstan known from one single specimen now presumed to be lost which was described in a publication of russian language with poor illustrations unionopterus affinities are extremely poorly known unionopterus was described in 1948 after the discovery of its only known specimen in the karaganda formation of kazakhstan at that time part of the soviet union this was one of the first discoveries of eurypterids in the soviet union and carboniferous eurypterids in general it was probably a swimming organism as well as other eurypterids although not as good as its relatives there are numerous factors that have made unionopterus a problematic genus for eurypterid researchers it has been placed in the family adelophthalmidae and it has even been speculated that a species of adelophthalmus a dumonti actually belongs to unionopterus but this cannot be confirmed many authors have chosen to completely ignore the genus during phylogenetic studies making unionopterus an enigmatic eurypterid unionopterus was a very small eurypterid with the length of the body being estimated at 2 38 cm 0 9

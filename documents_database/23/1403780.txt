it is a variant of the progress spacecraft originally built in the late 1980s as a modernised version of the progress 7k tg spacecraft using new systems developed for the soyuz t and soyuz tm spacecraft the 11f61560 variant incorporated further modernisation with digital flight control systems replacing the earlier analogue ones the older 11f615a55 spacecraft was phased out in favour of the 11f615a60 with the last launch of the older model in july 2009 the first forty three progress m spacecraft were used to resupply mir with subsequent spacecraft flying to the international space station eighty seven spacecraft have been launched with sixty seven using the older model and twenty using the newer version launches of the 11f615a60 are continuing one 11f615a60 progress m 12m was lost in a launch failure in august 2011 progress m 27m was launched on 28 april 2015 but communication with the vessel was lost soon after with vehicle control lost it is expected to destructively re enter due to orbital decay two progress m spacecraft m 14 and m 38 were modified to carry vdu attitude control systems to the mir space station the progress m1 is a derivative of the progress m

this novel adopts the form of a diary divided into eight chapters each of which corresponds to a year of exile that reveal the steps of a progressive maturation or a conversion of sorts the novel s universe is linked together around a primordial axis whose two poles are roman society and the dacian world respectively this dichotomy generates a rich range of metaphors but perhaps this novel s most important attribute is the way in which both worlds are constructed and their importance as chronotopes in the narrative ovid s spiritual journey resolves itself between both symbolic universes whose antagonistic characters become interwoven during a chiasm in order to rise up again at the end of the radically metamorphized narration

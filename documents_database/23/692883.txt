handling errors in this manner is considered bad practice and an anti pattern in computer programming in languages with exception handling support this practice is called exception swallowing errors and exceptions have several purposes when errors are swallowed these purposes can t be accomplished information about the error is lost which makes it very hard to track down problems depending on how the software is implemented it can cause unintended side effects that cascade into other errors destabilizing the system without information about the root cause of the problem it s very hard to figure out what is going wrong or how to fix it in this c example even though the code inside the try block throws an exception it gets caught by the blanket catch clause the exception has been swallowed and is considered handled and the program continues in this powershell example the trap clause catches the exception being thrown and swallows it by continuing execution the i should not be here message is shown as if no exception had happened exception swallowing can also happen if the exception is handled and rethrown as a different exception discarding the original exception and all its context in this

it targets desktop mobile and server markets it is used for the amd accelerated processing unit formerly fusion amd fx and the opteron line of processors the changes over bulldozer are incremental piledriver uses the same module design its main improvements are to branch prediction and fpu integer scheduling along with a switch to hard edge flip flops to improve power consumption this resulted in clock speed gains of 8 10 and a performance increase of around 15 with similar power characteristics fx 9590 is around 40 faster than bulldozer based fx 8150 mostly because of higher clock speed products based on piledriver were first released on 15 may 2012 with the amd accelerated processing unit apu code named trinity series of mobile products apus aimed at desktops followed in early october 2012 with piledriver based fx series cpus released later in the month opteron server processors based upon piledriver were announced in early december 2012 piledriver includes improvements over the original bulldozer microarchitecture the k suffix denotes an unlocked a series processor all fx series processors are unlocked unless otherwise specified some opteron 32 nm processors leaked roadmaps showed piledriver cpus featuring up to ten cores as part of

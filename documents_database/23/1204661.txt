it uses hot air that is either free from water vapor or has very little of it where this moisture plays a minimal or no role in the process of sterilization the dry heat sterilization process is accomplished by conduction that is where heat is absorbed by the exterior surface of an item and then passed inward to the next layer eventually the entire item reaches the proper temperature needed to achieve sterilization the proper time and temperature for dry heat sterilization is 160 c 320 f for 2 hours or 170 c 340 f for 1 hour or in the case of high velocity hot air sterilisers 190 c 375 f for 6 to 12 minutes items should be dry before sterilization since water will interfere with the process dry heat destroys microorganisms by causing denaturation of proteins the presence of moisture such as in steam sterilization significantly speeds up heat penetration there are two types of hot air convection convection refers to the circulation of heated air within the chamber of the oven sterilizers a mechanical convection oven contains a blower that actively forces heated air throughout all areas of the chamber the flow created by the blower

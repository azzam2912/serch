another view sees system analysis as a problem solving technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose the field of system analysis relates closely to requirements analysis or to operations research it is also an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a decision maker identify a better course of action and make a better decision than she might otherwise have made the terms analysis and synthesis stem from greek meaning to take apart and to put together respectively these terms are used in many scientific disciplines from mathematics and logic to economics and psychology to denote similar investigative procedures analysis is defined as the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts while synthesis means the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole system analysis researchers apply methodology to the systems involved forming an overall picture system analysis is used in every field where something is developed analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together such as system engineering system

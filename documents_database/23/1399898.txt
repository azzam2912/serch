kolar vienna rectifier provides following features the vienna rectifier is a unidirectional three phase three switch three level pulse width modulation pwm rectifier it can be seen as a three phase diode bridge with an integrated boost converter the vienna rectifier is useful wherever six switch converters are used for achieving sinusoidal mains current and controlled output voltage when no energy feedback from the load into the mains is available in practice use of the vienna rectifier is advantageous when space is at a sufficient premium to justify the additional hardware cost these include figure 2 shows the top and bottom views of an air cooled 10 kw vienna rectifier 400 khz pwm with sinusoidal input current s and controlled output voltage dimensions are 250mm x 120mm x 40mm resulting in a power density of 8 5 kw dm the total weight of the converter is 2 1 kg figure 3 shows the system behavior calculated using the power electronics circuit simulator between the output voltage midpoint 0 and the mains midpoint m the common mode voltage u0m appears as is characteristic in three phase converter systems it is possible to separately control the input current shape in each branch

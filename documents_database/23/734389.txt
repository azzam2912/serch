its integral computer reads signals generated by linear encoders or less frequently rotary encoders installed to track machine axes using these measures to keep track of and display to a machine operator the workpiece position e g milling machines or tool position lathes grinders etc in space in machine shop terminology the complete digital read out system consisting of a computer axis position encoders and a numeric display is referred to by the acronym dro such a system is commonly fitted to machines in today s shops especially for metal working lathes cylindrical grinders milling machines surface grinders boring mills and other machine tools to allow the operator to work faster and with greater accuracy use of dros is not limited to manually operated machines cnc machines can usually be switched to manual operation and in this case a form of dro is simulated on its control panel several 7 segment displays or an lcd screen on more expensive models display the position of each machine axis three axis systems including the x y z axes are common on milling machines those plus u and w are used on highly sophisticated 5 axis vertical machining centers lathes or cylindrical grinders

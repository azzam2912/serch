the most important difference between stem cells and progenitor cells is that stem cells can replicate indefinitely whereas progenitor cells can divide only a limited number of times controversy about the exact definition remains and the concept is still evolving the terms progenitor cell and stem cell are sometimes equated most progenitors are described as oligopotent in this point of view they may be compared to adult stem cells but progenitors are said to be in a further stage of cell differentiation they are in the center between stem cells and fully differentiated cells the kind of potency they have depends on the type of their parent stem cell and also on their niche some progenitor cells were found during research and were isolated after their marker was found it was proven that these progenitor cells could move through the body and migrate towards the tissue where they are needed many properties are shared by adult stem cells and progenitor cells progenitor cells are found in adult organisms and they act as a repair system for the body they replenish special cells but also maintain the blood skin and intestinal tissues they can also be found in developing embryonic pancreatic

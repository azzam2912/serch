the current being copied can be and sometimes is a varying signal current conceptually an ideal current mirror is simply an ideal inverting current amplifier that reverses the current direction as well or it can consist of a current controlled current source cccs the current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits it can also be used to model a more realistic current source since ideal current sources don t exist the circuit topology covered here is one that appears in many monolithic ics it is a widlar mirror without an emitter degeneration resistor in the follower output transistor this topology can only be done in an ic as the matching has to be extremely close and cannot be achieved with discretes another topology is the wilson current mirror the wilson mirror solves the early effect voltage problem in this design there are three main specifications that characterize a current mirror the first is the transfer ratio in the case of a current amplifier or the output current magnitude in the case of a constant current source ccs the second is its ac output resistance which determines how much the output current varies with the

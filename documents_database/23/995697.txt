the ribozyme acts to process the rna transcripts to unit lengths in a self cleavage reaction during replication of the hepatitis delta virus which is thought to propagate by a double rolling circle mechanism the ribozyme is active in vivo in the absence of any protein factors and was the fastest known naturally occurring self cleaving rna at the time of its discovery the crystal structure of this ribozyme has been solved using x ray crystallography and shows five helical segments connected by a double pseudoknot in addition to the sense genomic version all hdv viruses also have an antigenomic version of the hdv ribozyme this version is not the exact complementary sequence but adopts the same structure as the sense genomic strand the only significant differences between the two are a small bulge in p4 stem and a shorter j4 2 junction both the genomic and antigenomic ribozymes are necessary for replication the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme is structurally and biochemically related to the mammalian cpeb3 ribozyme unrelated sequences with high similarity to the hdv ribozyme have evolved through convergent evolution in some retrotransposons e g in the r2 rna element in insects and in the l1tc and probably

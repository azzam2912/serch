this subfamily includes the previous families adiantaceae adiantoids or maidenhair ferns and vittariaceae vittarioids or shoestring ferns the subfamily includes two distinct groups of ferns the adiantoids consisting of the single genus adiantum and the vittarioids several genera including vittaria which typically have highly reduced leaves usually entire and an epiphytic habit the following diagram shows a likely phylogenetic relationship between the vittarioideae and other subfamilies of the pteridaceae the first suprageneric classification based on vittaria was made by carl borivoj presl in 1836 who erected the tribe vittariaceae to contain the genera vittaria and prosaptia the latter now included in the grammitid ferns he invented the new genus haplopteris to accommodate another group of simple leaved ferns separated from pteris but placed it in tribe adiantaceae instead due to the location of its sori just behind the leaf margin in his 1911 treatment of the tribe ralph benedict adopted a circumscription similar to modern treatments within which he recognized the genera ananthacorus anetium antrophyum hecistopteris monogramma polytaenium and vittaria he described radiovittaria as a subgenus of vittaria subsumed scoliosorus within polytaenium as doubtfully worthy of subgeneric rank while rheopteris had not yet been discovered haplopteris he explicitly synonymized with

after first attempting the synthesis in 1903 otto ruff prepared nitrogen trifluoride by the electrolysis of a molten mixture of ammonium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride it proved to be far less reactive than the other nitrogen trihalides nitrogen trichloride nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide all of which are explosive alone among the nitrogen trihalides it has a negative enthalpy of formation today it is prepared both by direct reaction of ammonia and fluorine and by a variation of ruff s method it is supplied in pressurized cylinders nf is slightly soluble in water without undergoing chemical reaction it is nonbasic with a low dipole moment of 0 2340 d by contrast ammonia is basic and highly polar 1 47 d this difference arises from the fluorine atoms acting as electron withdrawing groups attracting essentially all of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom nf is a potent yet sluggish oxidizer it oxidizes hydrogen chloride to chlorine it converts to tetrafluorohydrazine upon contact with metals but only at high temperatures nf reacts with fluorine and antimony pentafluoride to give the tetrafluoroammonium salt nitrogen trifluoride is used in the plasma etching of silicon wafers today nitrogen trifluoride is predominantly employed in

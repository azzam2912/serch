if both the donor and acceptor are sugars then the product is an oligosaccharide the reaction requires activation with a suitable activating reagent the reactions often result in a mixture of products due to the creation of a new stereogenic centre at the anomeric position of the glycosyl donor the formation of a glycosidic linkage allows for the synthesis of complex polysaccharides which may play important roles in biological processes and pathogenesis and therefore having synthetic analogs of these molecules allows for further studies with respect to their biological importance the glycosylation reaction involves the coupling of a glycosyl donor and a glycosyl acceptor via initiation using an activator under suitable reaction conditions an activator is commonly a lewis acid which enables the leaving group at the anomeric position to leave and results in the formation of the oxocarbenium ion the formation of a glycosidic linkage results in the formation of a new stereogenic centre and therefore a mixture of products may be expected to result the linkage formed may either be axial or equatorial or with respect to glucose to better understand this the mechanism of a glycosylation reaction must be considered the stereochemical outcome of a glycosylation reaction

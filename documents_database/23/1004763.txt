the majority of tail lifts are hydraulic or pneumatic in operation although they can be mechanical and are controlled by an operator using an electric relay switch using a tail lift can make it unnecessary to use machinery such as a forklift truck to load heavy items on to a vehicle a tail lift can also bridge the difference in height between a loading dock and the vehicle load bed tail lifts are available for many sizes of vehicle from standard vans to articulated lorries and standard models can lift anywhere up to 2500kg tail lifts are most often categorized by design type tail lift design types include parallel arm railgate column cantilever tuckunder and slider parallel arm lifts support lower lifting capacities and are commonly installed on pickup trucks and service truck bodies the parallel arms attach to both sides of the lifting platform and guide the platform out and away from the liftgate mainframe parallel arm designs can either feature two hydraulic cylinders applying force directly to the lifting platform or a single hydraulic cylinder using some version of a cable pulley system railgate lifts are very similar in design to column lifts but generally support lower lifting

the instrumentation includes two low energy imaging telescopes leit with wolter i x ray optics for the 0 04 2 kev energy range a medium energy experiment using ar co and xe co detectors for 1 5 50 kev a xe he gas scintillation spectrometer gspc covering 2 80 kev and a reprogrammable onboard data processing computer exosat was capable of observing an object in the direct pointing mode for up to 80 hours and of locating sources to within at least 10 arcsec with the leit and about 2 arcsec with gspc during the period from 1967 to 1969 the european space research organisation esro studied two separate missions a european x ray observatory satellite as a combined x and gamma ray observatory cos a and a gamma ray observatory cos b cos a was dropped after the initial study and cos b was proceeded with later in 1969 a separate satellite the highly eccentric lunar occultation satellite helos was proposed the helos mission was to determine accurately the location of bright x ray sources using the lunar occultation technique in 1973 the observatory part of the mission was added and mission approval from the european space agency council

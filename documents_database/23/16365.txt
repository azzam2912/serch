in telecommunications marketing the term dsl is widely understood to mean asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl the most commonly installed dsl technology for internet access dsl service can be delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line since dsl uses higher frequency bands for data on the customer premises a dsl filter on each non dsl outlet blocks any high frequency interference to enable simultaneous use of the voice and dsl services the bit rate of consumer dsl services typically ranges from 256 kbit s to over 100 mbit s in the direction to the customer downstream depending on dsl technology line conditions and service level implementation bit rates of 1 gbit s have been reached in adsl the data throughput in the upstream direction the direction to the service provider is lower hence the designation of asymmetric service in symmetric digital subscriber line sdsl services the downstream and upstream data rates are equal researchers at bell labs have reached speeds over 1 gbit s for symmetrical broadband access services using traditional copper telephone lines though such speeds have not yet been deployed elsewhere it was originally thought that it was not possible to operate a conventional

the basic idea is to knit a solid fabric then deliberately drop one or more stitches i e draw a loop out from the loop below it and so on repeatedly producing a run or ladder in the fabric the run will continue to the bottom i e cast on edge of the garment or until it encounters an increase at which it stops drop stich runs are an easy way to get the see through effect of lace but with a much more casual look the designer can make interesting arrangements of open stripes of whatever length the endpoints of the stripe are specified by the initial increase and the point at which the first stitch was dropped drop stitch stripes are usually vertical since they follow the grain of the knitting i e the wales the columns of dependent loops however the grain of the knitting can be made off vertical e g in entrelac or by increasing on one edge and decreasing on the other a drop stitch that does not produce a vertical strip or a run occurs when the initial increase happens in the middle of a stitch wrap the yarn over the right needle

the behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering especially physical chemistry chemical engineering and mechanical engineering but also in fields as complex as meteorology historically thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines particularly through the work of french physicist nicolas l onard sadi carnot 1824 who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help france win the napoleonic wars scots irish physicist lord kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854 which stated thermo dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies and the relation of heat to electrical agency the initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines was extended early on to the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of

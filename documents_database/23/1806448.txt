they are used to detect fires in buildings where standard point smoke detectors would either be uneconomical or restricted for use by the height of the building optical beam smoke detectors are often installed in warehouses as a cost effective means of protecting large open spaces optical beam smoke detectors work on the principle of light obscuration where the presence of smoke blocks some of the light from the beam typically through either absorbance or light scattering once a certain percentage of the transmitted light has been blocked by the smoke a fire is signalled optical beam smoke detectors are typically used to detect fires in large commercial and industrial buildings as components in a larger fire alarm system optical beam smoke detectors consist of at least one light transmitter and one receiver which is photosensitive the photosensitive receiver monitors light produced by the transmitter under normal conditions in the absence of smoke light passes from the light transmitter to the receiver in a straight line in a fire when smoke falls within the path of the beam detector some of the light is absorbed or scattered by the smoke particles this creates a decrease in the received signal leading

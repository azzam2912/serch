they are also important in the interpolation of data in signal processing and the theory of spline functions the existence of partitions of unity assumes two distinct forms thus one chooses either to have the supports indexed by the open cover or compact supports if the space is compact then there exist partitions satisfying both requirements a finite open cover always has a continuous partition of unity subordinated to it provided the space is locally compact and hausdorff paracompactness of the space is a necessary condition to guarantee the existence of a partition of unity subordinate to any open cover depending on the category to which the space belongs it may also be a sufficient condition the construction uses mollifiers bump functions which exist in continuous and smooth manifolds but not in analytic manifolds thus for an open cover of an analytic manifold an analytic partition of unity subordinate to that open cover generally does not exist see analytic continuation if r and s are partitions of unity for spaces x and y respectively then the set of all pairwise products formula 3 is a partition of unity for the cartesian product space x y we can construct a partition

a smooth function is a function that has derivatives of all orders everywhere in its domain differentiability class is a classification of functions according to the properties of their derivatives higher order differentiability classes correspond to the existence of more derivatives consider an open set on the real line and a function f defined on that set with real values let k be a non negative integer the function f is said to be of differentiability class c if the derivatives f f f exist and are continuous the continuity is implied by differentiability for all the derivatives except for f the function f is said to be of class c or smooth if it has derivatives of all orders the function f is said to be of class c or analytic if f is smooth and if its taylor series expansion around any point in its domain converges to the function in some neighborhood of the point c is thus strictly contained in c bump functions are examples of functions in c but not in c to put it differently the class c consists of all continuous functions the class c consists of all differentiable functions whose derivative is

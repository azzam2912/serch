apart from the five conserved domains the rfx proteins diverge significantly the dna binding and dimerization domains of the rfx family proteins show no similarities to the other domains with the same functions in other proteins the rfx protein family is conserved in s pombe s cerevisiae c elegans mice and humans there are seven known rfx proteins in humans five in mice and one in c elegans as well as one in each of the two species of yeast the protein encoded by this gene is structurally related to regulatory factors x2 x3 x4 and x5 it is a transcriptional activator that can bind dna as a monomer or as a heterodimer with rfx family members x2 x3 and x5 but not with x4 this protein binds to the xboxes of mhc class ii genes and is essential for their expression also it can bind to an inverted repeat that is required for expression of hepatitis b virus genes the rfx proteins were originally cloned and characterized due to their high affinity for a cis acting promoter sequence called the xbox found in all mhc class ii genes levels of mrna encoding this protein as well as rfx2 and

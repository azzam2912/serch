the paper was first published in march 2010 in the journal economic inquiry he described the paper as something he wrote to cheer himself up when he was an oppressed assistant professor caught up in the academic rat race krugman analyzed the question of how should interest rates on goods in transit be computed when the goods travel at close to the speed of light this is a problem because the time taken in transit will appear less to an observer traveling with the goods than to a stationary observer krugman emphasized that in spite of its farcical subject matter the economic analysis in the paper is correctly done in his own words while the subject of this paper is silly the analysis actually does make sense this paper then is a serious analysis of a ridiculous subject which is of course the opposite of what is usual in economics responding to the paper the economist tyler cowen speculated on how time travel affects time preference discounting my own puzzling focuses on the determinants of real interest rates given how time dilation changes the meaning of time preference as you approach the speed of light you move into the future

over the years with research done at the department of informatics of the pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro it evolved into a semiotic theory of human computer interaction hci semiotic engineering views hci as computer mediated communication between designers and users at interaction time the system speaks for its designers in various types of conversations specified at design time these conversations communicate the designers understanding of who the users are what they know the users want or need to do in which preferred ways and why the designers message to users includes even the interactive language in which users will have to communicate back with the system in order to achieve their specific goals so the process is in fact one of communication about communication or metacommunication semiotic engineering has two methods to evaluate the quality of metacommunication in hci the semiotic inspection method sim and the communicability evaluation method cem in the 2009 book semiotic engineering methods for scientific research in hci clarisse de souza and carla leit o discuss how sim and cem which are both qualitative methods can also be used in scientific contexts to generate new knowledge about hci to illustrate their points the

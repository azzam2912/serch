rich detectors were first developed in the 1980s and are used in high energy elementary particle nuclear and astro physics experiments this article outlines the origins and principles of the rich detector with brief examples of its different forms in modern physics experiments the ring imaging detection technique was first proposed by jacques s guinot and tom ypsilantis working at cern in 1977 their research and development of high precision single photon detectors and related optics lay the foundations for the design and construction of the first large scale particle physics rich detectors at cern s omega facility and lep large electron positron collider delphi experiment a ring imaging cherenkov rich detector allows the identification of electrically charged subatomic particle types through the detection of the cherenkov radiation emitted as photons by the particle in traversing a medium with refractive index formula 1 1 the identification is achieved by measurement of the angle of emission formula 2 of the cherenkov radiation which is related to the charged particle s velocity formula 3 by where formula 5 is the speed of light knowledge of the particle s momentum and direction normally available from an associated momentum spectrometer allows a predicted formula

the wigner distribution function or wigner ville distribution wvd for analytic signals also has applications in time frequency analysis the wigner distribution gives better auto term localisation compared to the smeared out spectrogram sp however when applied to a signal with multi frequency components cross terms appear due to its quadratic nature several methods have been proposed to reduce the cross terms for example in 1994 l stankovic proposed a novel technique now mostly referred to as s method resulting in the reduction or removal of cross terms the concept of the s method is a combination between the spectrogram and the pseudo wigner distribution pwd the windowed version of the wd the original wd the spectrogram and the modified wds all belong to the cohen s class of bilinear time frequency representations where formula 2 is cohen s kernel function which is often a low pass function and normally serves to mask out the interference in the original wigner representation cohen s kernel function formula 4 where formula 6 is the short time fourier transform of formula 7 cohen s kernel function formula 9 which is the wd of the window function itself this can be verified by applying

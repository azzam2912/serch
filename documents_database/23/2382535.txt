during the purification process the majority of the hcps are removed 99 but residual hcp amounts remain in the distributed products such as monoclonal antibodies mabs antibody drug conjugates adcs therapeutic proteins vaccines and other protein based biopharmaceuticals national regulatory authorizations such as fda and ema require that biopharmaceuticals must be analysed and purified to reduce hcps to an acceptable level the hcp acceptance level is evaluated case by case and depends on multiple factors including dose frequency of drug administration type of drug and severity of disease analysis of hcps is not simple since the hcp mixture consists of a large number of protein species which are unique to the specific host and not related to the intended recombinant protein the acceptance level of hcps has commonly been in the range 1 100 ppm 1 100 ng mg product due to the detection limit of the established analytical methods even with these trace levels of hcps in the final product reaching the patient it is unknown if specific residual protein impurities might affect protein stability or immunogenicity in the patient if the stability is affected durability of the active substance in a biopharmaceutical could decrease it is also possible

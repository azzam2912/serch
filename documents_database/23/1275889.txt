it allows divers to descend several hundred metres precautions are necessary when using hydrox since mixtures containing more than a few percent of both oxygen and hydrogen are explosive if ignited hydrogen is the lightest gas half the weight of helium but still has a narcotic potential and may cause hydrogen narcosis although the first reported use of hydrogen seems to be by antoine lavoisier 1743 1794 who had guinea pigs breathe it the actual first uses of this gas in diving are usually attributed to trials by the swedish engineer arne zetterstr m in 1945 zetterstr m showed that hydrogen was perfectly usable to great depths following a fault in using the surface equipment he died during a demonstration dive the study of hydrogen was not resumed until several years later by the united states navy and by the compagnie maritime d expertises comex initially during their hydra i and hydra ii experiments in 1968 and 1969 comex subsequently developed procedures allowing dives between 500 and 700 metres 1650 to 2300 feet in depth while breathing gas mixtures based on hydrogen called hydrox hydrogen oxygen or hydreliox hydrogen helium oxygen in july 2012 after about a year of preparation

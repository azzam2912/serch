this leads to a limited number of the usual suspects who will say expected ideas that will not require extensive explanation such as mainstream political ones the beauty of concision you know saying a couple sentences between two commercials the beauty of that is you can only repeat conventional thoughts suppose i go on nightline whatever it is two minutes and i say gaddafi is a terrorist khomeini is a murderer etcetera etcetera i don t need any evidence everyone just nods on the other hand suppose you re saying something that isn t just regurgitating conventional pieties suppose you say something that s the least bit unexpected or controversial people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean if you said that you d better have a reason better have some evidence you can t give evidence if you re stuck with concision that s the genius of this structural constraint furthermore introducing controversial or unexpected statements that do not conform to those conventional ideas are discouraged as time inefficient because the person will be required to explain and support them in detail since this can often take considerable time in itself and digress from the primary discussion

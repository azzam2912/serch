it bears homology to the c elegans ced4 protein it contains an n terminal card domain a central nucleotide binding nacht domain and a c terminal leucine rich repeat lrr domain it belongs to a family of nlr proteins that includes the transcriptional co activator ciita and the canonical inflammasome protein nlrp3 a truncated murine nlrc4 was the first member of this family whose crystal structure was solved nlrc4 is best associated with triggering formation of the inflammasome unlike nlrp3 certain inflammasome dependent functions of nlrc4 may be carried out independently of the inflammasome scaffold asc human ced4 homologs include apaf1 nod1 card4 and nod2 card15 these proteins have at least 1 n terminal card domain followed by a centrally located nucleotide binding domain nbd or nacht and a c terminal regulatory domain found only in mammals that contains either wd40 repeats or leucine rich repeats lrrs card12 is a member of the ced4 family and can induce apoptosis nlrc4 has been shown to interact with naip there is one human naip but mice express at least 4 distinct naip proteins the naip nlrc4 interaction may determine the ligand specificity nlrc4 dependent inflammasome activity activates casp1 under certain circumstances nlrc4

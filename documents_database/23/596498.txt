one recovers the former definition from the latter under the assumptions that lines have more than 2 points points lie on more than 2 lines and there exist a line and a point p not on so that p is collinear to all points of let formula 1 be the projective space of dimension formula 2 over the finite field formula 3 and let formula 4 be a reflexive sesquilinear form or a quadratic form on the underlying vector space then the elements of the finite classical polar space associated with this form consists of the totally isotropic subspaces when formula 4 is a sesquilinear form or the totally singular subspaces when formula 4 is a quadratic form of formula 1 with respect to formula 4 the witt index of the form is equal to the largest vector space dimension of the subspace contained in the polar space and it is called the rank of the polar space these finite classical polar spaces can be summarised by the following table where formula 2 is the dimension of the underlying projective space and formula 10 is the rank of the polar space the number of points in a formula 11 is

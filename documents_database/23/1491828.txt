in a congestion game we define players and resources where the payoff of each player depends on the resources it chooses and the number of players choosing the same resource congestion games are a special case of potential games rosenthal proved that any congestion game is a potential game and monderer and shapley 1996 proved the converse for any potential game there is a congestion game with the same potential function consider a traffic net where two players originate at point o and need to get to point t suppose that node o is connected to node t via connection points a and b where a is a little closer than b i e a is more likely to be chosen by each player however both connection points get easily congested meaning the more players pass through a point the greater the delay of each player becomes so having both players go through the same connection point causes extra delay good outcome in this game will be for the two players to coordinate and pass through different connection points can such outcome be achieved and if so what will the cost be for each player discrete congestion games are games

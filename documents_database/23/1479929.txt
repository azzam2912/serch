the original oilite and oilite plus are bronze alloys while super oilite and super oilite 16 are iron based oilite was developed by chrysler in 1930 originally for use in bearings for water pumps and spring shackles and without oil as the porous filter element in gasoline filters chrysler sold approximately 500 000 oilite bearings in 1930 and approximately 2 5 million the next year the super oilite was introduced in 1932 overall sales of all oilite material in 1932 was seven million this rose to 18 million in 1933 oilite was a profit center for chrysler during this time currently the oilite trademark belongs to beemer precision oilite is formed using powder metallurgy so that tiny pores are present in the metal the pores are then vacuum impregnated with an oil to improve the material s bearing ability the material holds approximately 20 oil by volume the most common lubricant is sae 30 oil due to the porous structure machining oilite poses a special situation to machine oilite the cutting tool must be and stay sharp therefore tungsten carbide is often used the sharp tool preserves the open pore structure because a dull tool would smear the material and

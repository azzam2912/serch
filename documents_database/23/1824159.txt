carbido complexes are a molecular subclass of carbides which are prevalent carbido complexes represent models for intermediates in fischer tropsch synthesis and related catalytic processes they are also used as precursors for the synthesis of more complicated carbides they are analogous to metal nitrido complexes a terminal carbido complex is ruc pcy cl with a ru c distance of 163 pm typical for a triple bond the complex can be obtained by metathesis of vinyl acetate to give ru ch p chme pcy cl results in a metastable ru cl pcy choac complex which then decomposes to eliminate acetic acid the naked carbido ligand is weakly basic forming complexes with other metal centers the c m bond is typically found to be around 1 65 angstroms the cnmr resonance values for the carbido carbons vary widely but range from 211 406 an early example of a terminal carbido complex is li moc nr which was prepared by deprotonation of the methylidyne precursor x ray crystallographic analysis reveals a mo c distance of 172 pm bridging carbido ligands can be subdivided into three classes called cumulenic metallocarbyne and polar covalent cumulenic compounds generally bridge two metal atoms of the same element

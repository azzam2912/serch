it produces a current in its secondary which is proportional to the current in its primary current transformers along with voltage or potential transformers are instrument transformers instrument transformers scale the large values of voltage or current to small standardized values that are easy to handle for measuring instruments and protective relays the instrument transformers isolate measurement or protection circuits from the high voltage of the primary system a current transformer provides a secondary current that is accurately proportional to the current flowing in its primary the current transformer presents a negligible load to the primary circuit current transformers are the current sensing units of the power system and are used at generating stations electrical substations and in industrial and commercial electric power distribution a current transformer has a primary winding a core and a secondary winding although some transformers including current transformers use an air core while the physical principles are the same the details of a current transformer compared with a voltage transformer will differ owing to different requirements of the application a current transformer is designed to maintain an accurate ratio between the currents in its primary and secondary circuits over a defined range the alternating current

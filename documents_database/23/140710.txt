functor categories are of interest for two main reasons suppose c is a small category i e the objects and morphisms form a set rather than a proper class and d is an arbitrary category the category of functors from c to d written as fun c d funct c d c d or d has as objects the covariant functors from c to d and as morphisms the natural transformations between such functors note that natural transformations can be composed if x f x g x is a natural transformation from the functor f c d to the functor g c d and x g x h x is a natural transformation from the functor g to the functor h then the collection x x f x h x defines a natural transformation from f to h with this composition of natural transformations known as vertical composition see natural transformation d satisfies the axioms of a category in a completely analogous way one can also consider the category of all contravariant functors from c to d we write this as funct c d if c and d are both preadditive categories i e their morphism sets are abelian groups

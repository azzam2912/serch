originally introduced independently by and in the older literature in german they were referred to as quasiconformal curves a terminology which also applied to arcs in complex analysis and geometric function theory quasicircles play a fundamental role in the description of the universal teichm ller space through quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the circle quasicircles also play an important role in complex dynamical systems a quasicircle is defined as the image of a circle under a quasiconformal mapping of the extended complex plane it is called a k quasicircle if the quasiconformal mapping has dilatation k the definition of quasicircle generalizes the characterization of a jordan curve as the image of a circle under a homeomorphism of the plane in particular a quasicircle is a jordan curve the interior of a quasicircle is called a quasidisk as shown in where the older term quasiconformal curve is used if a jordan curve is the image of a circle under a quasiconformal map in a neighbourhood of the curve then it is also the image of a circle under a quasiconformal mapping of the extended plane and thus a quasicircle the same is true for quasiconformal arcs which can be defined as quasiconformal images

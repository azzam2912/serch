the traditional use has been for land surveying but they are also used extensively for building and infrastructure construction and some specialized applications such as meteorology and rocket launching it consists of a moveable telescope mounted so it can rotate around horizontal and vertical axes and provide angular readouts these indicate the orientation of the telescope and are used to relate the first point sighted through the telescope to subsequent sightings of other points from the same theodolite position these angles can be measured with great accuracy typically to milliradian or seconds of arc from these readings a plan can be drawn or objects can be positioned in accordance with an existing plan the modern theodolite has evolved into what is known as a total station where angles and distances are measured electronically and are read directly to computer memory in a transit theodolite the telescope is short enough to rotate through the zenith otherwise for non transit instruments vertical or altitude rotation is restricted to a limited arc the optical level is sometimes mistaken for a theodolite but it does not measure vertical angles and is used only for levelling on a horizontal plane temporary adjustments are a set

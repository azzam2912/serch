this yellow oily pungent smelling and explosive liquid is most commonly encountered as a byproduct of chemical reactions between ammonia derivatives and chlorine for example in swimming pools the compound is prepared by treatment of ammonium salts such as ammonium nitrate with chlorine intermediates in this conversion include monochloramine and dichloramine nhcl and nhcl respectively like ammonia ncl is a pyramidal molecule the n cl distances are 1 76 and the cl n cl angles are 107 the chemistry of ncl has been well explored it is moderately polar with a dipole moment of 0 6 d the nitrogen center is basic but much less so than ammonia it is hydrolyzed by hot water to release ammonia and hypochlorous acid ncl explodes to give n and chlorine gas this reaction is inhibited for dilute gases nitrogen trichloride can form in small amounts when public water supplies are disinfected with monochloramine and in swimming pools by disinfecting chlorine reacting with urea in urine and sweat from bathers nitrogen trichloride trademarked as agene was at one time used to bleach flour but this practice was banned in the united states in 1949 due to safety concerns nitrogen trichloride can irritate mucous membranes

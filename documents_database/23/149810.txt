such a measure exists if and only if the market is arbitrage free the easiest way to remember what the risk neutral measure is or to explain it to a probability generalist who might not know much about finance is to realize that it is it is also worth noting that in most introductory applications in finance the pay offs under consideration are deterministic given knowledge of prices at some terminal or future point in time this is not strictly necessary to make use of these techniques prices of assets depend crucially on their risk as investors typically demand more profit for bearing more risk therefore today s price of a claim on a risky amount realised tomorrow will generally differ from its expected value most commonly investors are risk averse and today s price is below the expectation remunerating those who bear the risk at least in large financial markets examples of risk seeking markets are casinos and lotteries to price assets consequently the calculated expected values need to be adjusted for an investor s risk preferences see also sharpe ratio unfortunately the discount rates would vary between investors and an individual s risk preference is difficult to quantify

it was flown to demonstrate the launch configuration for future mol missions a number of research payloads designated manifold were carried on board which were intended to operate for 75 days however the spacecraft ceased operations after just 30 it was built from a decommissioned hgm 25a titan i first stage oxidizer tank bolted to a transtage it was part of the mol and orbiting vehicle projects the manifold experimental package consisted of two micrometeoroid detection payloads a transmitter beacon designated orbis low a cell growth experiment a prototype hydrogen fuel cell a thermal control experiment a propellent transfer and monitoring system to investigate fluid dynamics in zero gravity a prototype attitude control system an experiment to investigate the reflection of light in space and an experiment into heat transfer the spacecraft was painted to allow it to be used as a target for an optical tracking and observation experiment from the ground ops 0855 was the primary payload of titan iiic 3c 9 the gemini b prototype capsule was flown on the same rocket and was released onto a suborbital trajectory during launch the adaptor connecting the gemini spacecraft to ops 0855 contained three additional spacecraft two ov4 1

after the association with argonaute protein family these short rna guide the rna induced silencing complex risc to their target by sequence complementarity pirnas have approximately from 26 to 31 nucleotides and are found in almost all metazoans this hsa pir 1082 found in samples from human germinative tissues align to human genome only once this alignment has overlap with a coding gene in this case abca2 this gene that already is described being high expressed in nervous system and is associated to lipid transport and more interesting resistance to anti tumor drugs furthermore a study found that the low expression on this genes can cause inhibition of prostate tumor metastasis on mouse one recent research found the hsa pir 1082 ncbi code pir 31106 in high expression on breast cell lines and tumoral biopsies although there are indications of the relations between this specific pirna and its putative gene target more studies need to be done to provide reliable relation about these celular components however it is a probably candidate to future researches

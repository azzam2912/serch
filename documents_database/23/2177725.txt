asprosin is encoded by the gene fbn1 as part of the protein profibrillin and is released from the c terminus of the latter by specific proteolysis in the liver asprosin activates rapid glucose release via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp dependent pathway asprosin was first identified by dr atul chopra and coworkers at baylor college of medicine as a c terminal cleavage product of the fbn1 gene product profibrillin they found mutations in the fbn1 gene in two patients with congenital partial lipodystrophy and a progeroid appearance the two patients were lizzie velasquez and abby solomon truncations of the fbn1 protein in these patients were seen to have two consequences for protein production a mutant truncated fibrillin protein and very low plasma asprosin levels from a postulated dominant negative effect the condition has since been named marfanoid progeroid lipodystrophy syndrome the liver stores excess glucose in the form of glycogen after a meal in response to insulin between meals or during fasting the liver is stimulated to break down this glycogen to release glucose glycogenolysis and also synthesizes new glucose gluconeogenesis this glucose is released into the bloodstream to maintain normal function of the brain and other organs that burn

the fundamental frequency of this sound is usually double of fundamental 50 hz or 60 hz 100 hz or 120 hz depending on the local power line frequency the sound often has heavy harmonic content above 50 60 hz because of the presence of mains current in mains powered audio equipment as well as ubiquitous ac electromagnetic fields from nearby appliances and wiring 50 60 hz electrical noise can get into audio systems and is heard as mains hum from their speakers mains hum may also be heard coming from powerful electric power grid equipment such as utility transformers caused by mechanical vibrations induced by magnetostriction in magnetic core onboard aircraft or spacecraft the frequency heard is often higher pitched due to the use of 400 hz ac power in these settings because 400 hz transformers are much smaller and lighter electric hum around transformers is caused by stray magnetic fields causing the enclosure and accessories to vibrate magnetostriction is a second source of vibration in which the core iron changes shape minutely when exposed to magnetic fields the intensity of the fields and thus the hum intensity is a function of the applied voltage because the magnetic flux density

this design is used in medical psychological and biological research to name a few areas it has several advantages over ab designs which only measure a single case it is important to note that the start of treatment conditions is staggered started at different times across individuals because treatment is started at different times we can conclude that changes are due to the treatment rather than to a chance factor by gathering data from many subjects instances inferences can be made about the likeliness that the measured trait generalizes to a greater population in multiple baseline designs the experimenter starts by measuring a trait of interest then applying a treatment before measuring that trait again treatment should not begin until a stable baseline has been recorded and should not finish until measures regain stability if a significant change occurs across all participants the experimenter may infer that the treatment is effective multiple base line experiments are most commonly used in cases where the dependent variable is not expected to return to normal after the treatment has been applied or when medical reasons forbid the withdrawal of a treatment they often employ particular methods or recruiting participants multiple base line designs

it is a generalization of a bayesian network in which not only probabilistic inference problems but also decision making problems following the maximum expected utility criterion can be modeled and solved id was first developed in the mid 1970s by decision analysts with an intuitive semantic that is easy to understand it is now adopted widely and becoming an alternative to the decision tree which typically suffers from exponential growth in number of branches with each variable modeled id is directly applicable in team decision analysis since it allows incomplete sharing of information among team members to be modeled and solved explicitly extensions of id also find their use in game theory as an alternative representation of the game tree an id is a directed acyclic graph with three types plus one subtype of node and three types of arc or arrow between nodes nodes arcs given a properly structured id alternative information and preference are termed decision basis in decision analysis they represent three required components of any valid decision situation formally the semantic of influence diagram is based on sequential construction of nodes and arcs which implies a specification of all conditional independencies in the diagram the specification

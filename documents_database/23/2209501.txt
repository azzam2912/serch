it may be described as the set of points for which the quadratic form for the space applied to the displacement vector from a centre point is a constant value with the inclusion of hyperplanes as a limiting case this article uses the following notation and terminology a quasi sphere is a submanifold of a pseudo euclidean space consisting of the points for which the displacement vector from a reference point satisfies the equation where and since in permitted this definition includes hyperplanes it is thus a generalization of generalized circles and their analogues in any number of dimensions this inclusion provides a more regular structure under conformal transformations than if they are omitted this definition has been generalized to affine spaces over complex numbers and quaternions by replacing the quadratic form with a hermitian form a quasi sphere in a quadratic space has a counter sphere furthermore if and is an isotropic line in through then puncturing the union of quasi sphere and counter sphere one example is the unit hyperbola that forms a quasi sphere of the hyperbolic plane and its conjugate hyperbola which is its counter sphere the centre of a quasi sphere is a point that

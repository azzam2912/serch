instead it can be thought of in terms of smooth map from to a smooth parametrized loop in in other words this is why it is called the loop algebra similarly a set of all smooth maps from to a lie group forms an infinite dimensional lie group lie group in the sense we can define functional derivatives over it called the loop group the lie algebra of a loop group is the corresponding loop algebra we can take the fourier transform on this loop algebra by defining as where is a coordinatization of if is a semisimple lie algebra then a nontrivial central extension of its loop algebra gives rise to an affine lie algebra

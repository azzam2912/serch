the m14 mechanism uses a belleville spring to flip a firing pin downwards into a stab detonator when pressure is applied once deployed the m14 is very difficult to detect because it is a minimum metal mine i e most of its components are plastic because of this the design was later modified to ease mine clearance via the addition of a steel washer glued onto the base of the mine in order to activate the m14 the base plug is removed and discarded and an m46 stab detonator is screwed into the base of the mine then the mine is placed into a shallow hole in the ground flush with the surface and the pressure plate is carefully rotated from its safety position to the armed position using the special arming spanner supplied in each crate of mines finally the u shaped metal safety clip is removed from the pressure plate by pulling on the attached cord at this point the mine is fully armed when deployed by the usa m14s are often laid together with other mines in their inventory i e the m16 m15 or m19 in a mixed minefield the anti tank mines protect anti personnel

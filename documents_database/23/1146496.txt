when the links in the tree are implemented by a computer network then that hierarchical control system is also a form of networked control system a human built system with complex behavior is often organized as a hierarchy for example a command hierarchy has among its notable features the organizational chart of superiors subordinates and lines of organizational communication hierarchical control systems are organized similarly to divide the decision making responsibility each element of the hierarchy is a linked node in the tree commands tasks and goals to be achieved flow down the tree from superior nodes to subordinate nodes whereas sensations and command results flow up the tree from subordinate to superior nodes nodes may also exchange messages with their siblings the two distinguishing features of a hierarchical control system are related to its layers besides artificial systems an animal s control systems are proposed to be organized as a hierarchy in perceptual control theory which postulates that an organism s behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions the organism s control systems are suggested to be organized in a hierarchical pattern as their perceptions are constructed so the accompanying diagram is a general hierarchical model which shows

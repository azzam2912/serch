they were first introduced by mile l onard mathieu who encountered them while studying vibrating elliptical drumheads they have applications in many fields of the physical sciences such as optics quantum mechanics and general relativity in general they tend to occur in problems involving some sort of periodic motion or in the analysis of partial differential equation boundary value problems possessing elliptic symmetry in some usages mathieu function refers to solutions of the mathieu differential equation for arbitrary values of formula 2 and formula 3 when no confusion can arise other authors use mathieu function to refer specifically to formula 6 or formula 7 periodic solutions which exist only for special values of formula 2 and formula 3 more precisely for given real formula 3 such periodic solutions exist for an infinite number of values of formula 2 called characteristic numbers conventionally indexed as two separate sequences formula 12 and formula 13 for formula 14 the corresponding functions are denoted formula 15 and formula 16 respectively they are sometimes also referred to as cosine elliptic and sine elliptic or mathieu functions of the first kind as a result of assuming that formula 3 is real both the characteristic numbers and

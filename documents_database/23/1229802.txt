it exists as a yellow hygroscopic solid which can form tetra hexa and decahydrates it is an intermediate in the extraction of chromium from its ores sodium chromate like other hexavalent chromium compounds is toxic and carcinogenic it is obtained on a vast scale by roasting chromium ores in air in the presence of sodium carbonate this process converts the chromium into a water extractable form leaving behind iron oxides typically calcium carbonate is included in the mixture to improve oxygen access and to keep silicon and aluminium impurities in an insoluble form the process temperature is typically around 1100 c for lab and small scale preparations a mixture of chromite ore sodium hydroxide and sodium nitrate reacting at lower temperatures may be used even 350 c in the corresponding potassium chromate system subsequent to its formation the chromate salt is converted to sodium dichromate the precursor to most chromium compounds and materials the industrial route to chromium iii oxide involves reduction of sodium chromate with sulfur it converts to sodium dichromate when treated with acids further acidification affords chromium trioxide aside from its central role in the production of chromium from its ores sodium chromate is used as a

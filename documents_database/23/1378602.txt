the machine removes excess air and open spaces in the powder leaving it a more solid compact material powder deaerators consist of two parallel drums a filter drum and a pressure drum which rotate in opposite directions the drums are driven via drive motor and spur gear the filter drum is coated with a porous sinter metal layer it is connected to a vacuum line via a hollow shaft creating a negative pressure within the filter drum an adjusting device serves for the setting of the gap width between the rollers on the adjusting device there are spring assemblies to generate the necessary pressure the material is aspirated sucked in and held on the filter drum by a vacuum where it is drawn in the space between the filter and pressure drums the combination of vacuum and pressure causes a deaerating and densification of the product at the end of the densification process the densified product is stripped off the filter drum by knives so it can leave the machine deaerators can be used for the deaerating and densification of all powders and other fine piece bulk materials the aim of the application is to raise the bulk density and

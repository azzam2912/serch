the software provides backup restore and replication functionality for virtual machines physical servers and workstations as well as cloud based workload veeam backup replication operates both the virtualization layer as well manages physical machine backup it backs up vms at the image level using a hypervisor s snapshots to retrieve vm data backups can be full a full copy of vm image or incremental saving only the changed blocks of data since the last backup job run backup increments are created using the built in changed block tracking cbt mechanism the available backup methods include forward incremental forever backup forward incremental backup and reverse incremental backup additionally there s an option to perform active full and synthetic full backups veeam backup replication provides automated recovery verification for both backups and replicas the program starts a vm directly from a backup or replica in the isolated test environment and runs tests against it during the verification the vm image remains in a read only state this mechanism can also be used for troubleshooting or testing patches and upgrades veeam backup replication supports software defined storage technology it allows organizing a scalable backup repository from a collection of heterogeneous storage devices backups

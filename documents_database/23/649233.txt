glue code does not contribute any functionality towards meeting program requirements instead it often appears in code that lets existing libraries or programs interoperate as in language bindings or foreign function interfaces such as the java native interface when mapping objects to a database using object relational mapping or when integrating two or more commercial off the shelf programs glue code may be written in the same language as the code it is gluing together or in a separate glue language glue code is very efficient in rapid prototyping environments where several components are quickly put together into a single language or framework because each component is independent i e it is unaware of its relations and is only connected to another component through glue code the behavior of a component and its interactions can change during the execution of the script in addition a different version of one of the components may behave differently breaking the glue code high level programming languages can suffer from performance penalties because glue code must run through the language interpreter even when connecting high performance subsystems if performance is crucial using configuration scripting is often preferred to directly connecting binary interfaces of components

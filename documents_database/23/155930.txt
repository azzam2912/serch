alternatively the name originates from the italian word giuppa gown which in turn might have come from arabic jubba although the garment itself probably is of central asian nomadic origin or from middle english middle french jupon an overcoat for armour whether the garment came from central asia or ottoman turkey or iran still remains a question and the same applies to the allied male garment the kontusz the central asian origin of this garment may be also deduced from the method of closure of the pre 1680s zupans for they were closed from right to left typical to central asian fashion while the sleeve ends terminated with dog ears that were almost like gloves without covering the fingers and were usually upturned to show the differently colored lining eventually an agraffe clasp or button was attached to this dog ear sleeve end to pin it to a sleeve once upturned and thus a cuff was created this style of cuff was known in the louis xiv period in france as the polish cuff and might have led to the development of colorful military cuffs used in western armies from 18th century onwards after the partition of ukraine in 1663

over 190 species are recognized in this genus this genus includes pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals including tuberculosis mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprosy mycobacterium leprae in humans the greek prefix myco means fungus alluding to the way mycobacteria have been observed to grow in a mold like fashion on the surface of cultures it is acid fast and cannot be stained by the gram stain procedure mycobacteria are aerobic they are bacillary in form at least in most phases that have attracted human microbiological attention to date they are straight or slightly curved rods between 0 2 and 0 6 m wide and between 1 0 and 10 m long they are generally nonmotile bacteria except for the species mycobacterium marinum which has been shown to be motile within macrophages they are characteristically acid fast mycobacteria have an outer membrane they possess capsules and most do not form endospores m marinum and perhaps m bovis have been shown to sporulate however this has been contested by further research the distinguishing characteristic of all mycobacterium species is that the cell wall is thicker than in many other bacteria being hydrophobic waxy and rich in mycolic acids mycolates the cell

regularized theta lifts of harmonic maass forms can be used to construct arakelov green functions for special divisors on orthogonal shimura varieties a complex valued smooth function on the upper half plane is called a weak maass form of integral weight for the group if it satisfies the following three conditions if is a weak maass form with eigenvalue 0 under formula 4 that is if formula 5 then is called a harmonic weak maass form or briefly a harmonic maass form every harmonic maass form of weight has a fourier expansion of the form where and are integers depending on moreover formula 7 denotes the incomplete gamma function which has to be interpreted appropriately when the first summand is called the holomorphic part and the second summand is called the non holomorphic part of there is a complex anti linear differential operator formula 8 defined by since formula 10 the image of a harmonic maass form is weakly holomorphic hence formula 8 defines a map from the vector space of harmonic maass forms of weight to the space of weakly holomorphic modular forms of weight it was proved in for arbitrary weights multiplier systems and congruence subgroups that this

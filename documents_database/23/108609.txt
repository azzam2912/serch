the nervous system regulates and controls bodily functions and activity and consists of two parts the central nervous system cns comprising the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system pns comprising the branching peripheral nerves it is composed of neurons or nerve cells which receive and transmit impulses and neuroglia also known as glial cells or glia which assist the propagation of the nerve impulse as well as provide nutrients to the neurons nervous tissue is made up of different types of nerve cells all of which have an axon an axon is the long stem like part of the cell that sends action potential signals to the next cell bundles of axons make up the nerves in the pns and tracts in the cns functions of the nervous system are sensory input integration control of muscles and glands homeostasis and mental activity nervous tissue is composed of neurons also called nerve cells and neuroglial cells four types of neuroglia found in the cns are astrocytes microglial cells ependymal cells and oligodendrocytes two types of neuroglia found in the pns are satellite cells and schwann cells in the central nervous system cns the tissue types found are grey

self began as a dialect of smalltalk being dynamically typed and using just in time compilation jit as well as the prototype based approach to objects it was first used as an experimental test system for language design in the 1980s and 1990s in 2006 self was still being developed as part of the klein project which was a self virtual machine written fully in self the latest version is 2017 1 released in may 2017 several just in time compilation techniques were pioneered and improved in self research as they were required to allow a very high level object oriented language to perform at up to half the speed of optimized c much of the development of self took place at sun microsystems and the techniques they developed were later deployed for java s hotspot virtual machine at one point a version of smalltalk was implemented in self because it was able to use the jit this also gave extremely good performance self was designed mostly by david ungar and randall smith in 1986 while working at xerox parc their objective was to push forward the state of the art in object oriented programming language research once smalltalk 80

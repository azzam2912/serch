it can be used in the discussion of geophysical data the law is used in forming compositional and mineralogical models of the mantle by using the change in the velocity of the seismic wave and its relationship with a change in density of the material the wave is moving in birch s law is used in determining chemical similarities in the mantle as well as the discontinuities of the transition zones birch s law can also be employed in the calculation of an increase of velocity due to an increase in the density of material it had been previously assumed that the velocity density relationship is constant that is that birch s law will hold true in any case but as you look deeper into the mantle the relationship does not hold true for the increased pressure that would be reached as you look deeper into the mantle near the transition zone earth in such cases where the assumption was made past the transition zone earth the solutions may need to be revised in future cases other laws may be needed to determine the velocities at high pressures the relationship between the density of a material and the velocity of

two main transcripts isoforms 1 and 4 each contain three exons and span 7288 and 26740 bp respectively they encode proteins of 156 and 173 amino acids isoform 1 encodes p16 ink4a while isoform 4 encodes p14 arf a protein that is structurally unrelated to p16 ink4 but acts in cell cycle g1 control by stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53 familial dysplastic nevus syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner the penetrance for melanoma in kindreds with cdkn2a mutations is estimated at 58 to 92 by 80 years of age and varies with geography the penetrance in cdkn2a mutation carriers for pancreatic cancer has been estimated to be 17 by 75 years of age as noted above there is wide variation in published estimates of the penetrance of cdkn2a mutations the histopathologic characteristics of melanoma in fammm kindreds are not different from those seen in sporadic cases of melanoma and thus are not useful in diagnosing the syndrome superficial spreading melanoma ssm and nodular melanoma are the most frequently encountered histological melanoma subtypes in patients with cdkn2a mutations which is consistent with the relative early age of onset ams has been described by multiple authors and institutions and

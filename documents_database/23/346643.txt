estimates of the number of species in this genus vary widely from 750 to 1200 phyllanthus has a remarkable diversity of growth forms including annual and perennial herbs shrubs climbers floating aquatics and pachycaulous succulents some have flattened leaflike stems called cladodes it has a wide variety of floral morphologies and chromosome numbers and has one of the widest range of pollen types of any seed plant genus despite their variety almost all phyllanthus species express a specific type of growth called phyllanthoid branching in which the vertical stems bear deciduous floriferous flower bearing plagiotropic horizontal or oblique stems the leaves on the main vertical axes are reduced to scales called cataphylls while leaves on the other axes develop normally phyllanthus is distributed in all tropical and subtropical regions on earth phyllanthus was first described by carl linnaeus in 1753 but the type was not designated the circumscription of this genus has been a cause of much confusion and disagreement molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that phyllanthus is paraphyletic over reverchonia glochidion sauropus and breynia a recent revision of the family phyllanthaceae has subsumed all four of these genera into phyllanthus this enlarged version of phyllanthus might eventually be divided

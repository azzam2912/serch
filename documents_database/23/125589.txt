by contrast if most of the elements are nonzero then the matrix is considered dense the number of zero valued elements divided by the total number of elements e g m n for an m n matrix is called the sparsity of the matrix which is equal to 1 minus the density of the matrix using those definitions a matrix will be sparse when its sparsity is greater than 0 5 conceptually sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled by contrast if the same line of balls had springs connecting each ball to all other balls the system would correspond to a dense matrix the concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application areas such as network theory which have a low density of significant data or connections large sparse matrices often appear in scientific or engineering applications when solving partial differential equations when storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the

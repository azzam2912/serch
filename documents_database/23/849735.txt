surgical removal or debulking is sometimes used to alleviate symptoms of the mass effect even if the underlying pathology is not curable in neurology a mass effect is the effect exerted by any mass including for example an evolving intracerebral hemorrhage a bleeding within the skull presenting with a clinically significant hematoma the hematoma can exert a mass effect on the brain increasing intracranial pressure and potentially causing midline shift or deadly brain herniation in the past this effect held additional diagnostic importance since prior to the invention of modern tomographic soft tissue imaging utilizing mri or ct it was not possible to directly image many kinds of primary intracranial lesions therefore in those days the mass effect of these abnormalities on surrounding structures was sometimes used to indirectly infer the existence of the primary abnormalities themselves for example by using a cerebral angiography to observe the secondary vascular displacement caused by a subdural hematoma pushing on the brain or by looking for a distortion caused by a tumor on the normal outline of the ventricles as depicted on a pneumoencephalogram unfortunately these studies were often invasive and uncomfortable for patients and provided only a partial assessment of the primary

lug finished work on a dune role playing game but the game was not printed due to legal disputes over the herbert license when wizards of the coast acquired lug they agreed as part of the deal to release lug s remaining projects one of these games was the icon system based dune chronicles of the imperium 2000 which they published in a limited released of just 3 000 copies most of these copies were made available at gen con 33 and other overseas conventions but the limited print run was not enough to satisfy the demand afterwards the frank herbert estate offered to renegotiate the license but they wanted much larger fees from wizards than they had received from lug thus wizards lost the dune license and a d20 dune book that the last unicorn team was working on was subsequently shelved the game is set in the dune universe delayed by legal issues and then a corporate buy out of last unicorn by wizards of the coast a limited edition run of 3000 copies of a core rule book was initially published pending wizards of the coast s conversion of the game to its d20 role playing game

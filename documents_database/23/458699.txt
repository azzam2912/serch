like all synthetic elements it has no stable isotopes the first isotope to be synthesized was cn in 1996 there are 6 known radioisotopes with one more unconfirmed the longest lived isotope is cn with a half life of 29 seconds super heavy elements such as copernicium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions whereas most of the isotopes of copernicium can be synthesized directly this way some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers depending on the energies involved the former are separated into hot and cold in hot fusion reactions very light high energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets such as actinides giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy 40 50 mev that may either fission or evaporate several 3 to 5 neutrons in cold fusion reactions the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy 10 20 mev which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions as the fused nuclei cool to the ground state they require emission of only one or two neutrons and thus allows for the generation of more neutron rich products

the rationale is that someone who is dying or believes death to be imminent would have less incentive to fabricate testimony and as such the hearsay statement carries with it some reliability in medieval english courts the principle originated of nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri no one on the point of death should be presumed to be lying an incident in which a dying declaration was admitted as evidence has been found in a 1202 case in common law a dying declaration must have been a statement made by a deceased person who would otherwise have been a credible witness to their own death by murder or manslaughter and was of settled hopeless expectation of death the admissibility of hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings has been governed by the criminal justice act 2003 which effectively replaced the common law regime and abolished all common law hearsay exceptions except those preserved by s 118 including the dying declaration exception an original statement made by a dead person may now be admissible under the statutory unavailability exception ss 114 116 subject to the courts judicial discretion preserved by s 126 to exclude unreliable evidence i e the prejudicial value outweighs the probative value

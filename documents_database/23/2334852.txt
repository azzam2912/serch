adhesives are commonly used for structural structural joints in various applications adhesives offer light weight and cost efficient options in design of mechanical members in many applications adhesive joints are the main load bearing joint as well as acting as a sealant in a joint as such the ability of adhesives for long service life needs to be assessed and evaluated this is done based on the long term performance information available regarding a particular adhesive of choice one of the ways to obtain the long term performance of an adhesive is using accelerated tests in these tests possible failure mechanisms of an adhesive system will be simulated in a manner that accelerates time in general service failures are predicted by accelerated tests in which parameters such as temperature moisture mechanical loading etc are increased in order to reduce the time to failure in the system under investigation adhesive systems are no exception to this method for predicting failures in the service environment that they are designed for the issue with usage of accelerated testing in adhesives stems from their complexity and varied reaction to test condition s in other words an accelerated test regime may induce reaction kinetics that

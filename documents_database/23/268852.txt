it is a 15 5 16 kda protein that regulates the activities of white blood cells leukocytes often lymphocytes that are responsible for immunity il 2 is part of the body s natural response to microbial infection and in discriminating between foreign non self and self il 2 mediates its effects by binding to il 2 receptors which are expressed by lymphocytes the major sources of il 2 are activated cd4 t cells and activated cd8 t cells il 2 is a member of a cytokine family each member of which has a four alpha helix bundle the family also includes il 4 il 7 il 9 il 15 and il 21 il 2 signals through the il 2 receptor a complex consisting of three chains termed alpha cd25 beta cd122 and gamma cd132 the gamma chain is shared by all family members the il 2 receptor il 2r subunit binds il 2 with low affinity k 10 m interaction of il 2 and cd25 alone does not lead to signal transduction due to its short intracellular chain but has the ability when bound to the and subunit to increase the il 2r affinity 100 fold heterodimerization of the and

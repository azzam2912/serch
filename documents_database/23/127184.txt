in many animals the germ cells originate in the primitive streak and migrate via the gut of an embryo to the developing gonads there they undergo meiosis followed by cellular differentiation into mature gametes either eggs or sperm unlike animals plants do not have germ cells designated in early development instead germ cells can arise from somatic cells in the adult such as the floral meristem of flowering plants multicellular eukaryotes are made of two fundamental cell types germ cells produce gametes and are the only cells that can undergo meiosis as well as mitosis these cells are sometimes said to be immortal because they are the link between generations somatic cells are all the other cells that form the building blocks of the body and they only divide by mitosis the lineage of germ cells is called germ line germ cell specification begins during cleavage in many animals or in the epiblast during gastrulation in birds and mammals after transport involving passive movements and active migration germ cells arrive at the developing gonads in humans sexual differentiation starts approximately 6 weeks after conception the end products of the germ cell cycle are the egg or sperm under special conditions

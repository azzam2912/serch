it is an extension of the cyclic group of order 2 by a cyclic group of order 2 n giving the name di cyclic in the notation of exact sequences of groups this extension can be expressed as more generally given any finite abelian group with an order 2 element one can define a dicyclic group for each integer n 1 the dicyclic group dic can be defined as the subgroup of the unit quaternions generated by more abstractly one can define the dicyclic group dic as the group with the following presentation some things to note which follow from this definition thus every element of dic can be uniquely written as a x where 0 k order 4 n when n 2 the dicyclic group is isomorphic to the quaternion group q more generally when n is a power of 2 the dicyclic group is isomorphic to the generalized quaternion group for each n 1 the dicyclic group dic is a non abelian group of order 4 n for the degenerate case n 1 the group dic is the cyclic group c which is not considered dicyclic let a be the subgroup of dic generated by a then a

peptides are chemically synthesized by the condensation reaction of the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another protecting group strategies are usually necessary to prevent undesirable side reactions with the various amino acid side chains chemical peptide synthesis most commonly starts at the carboxyl end of the peptide c terminus and proceeds toward the amino terminus n terminus protein biosynthesis long peptides in living organisms occurs in the opposite direction the chemical synthesis of peptides can be carried out using classical solution phase techniques although these have been replaced in most research and development settings by solid phase methods see below solution phase synthesis retains its usefulness in large scale production of peptides for industrial purposes however chemical synthesis facilitates the production of peptides which are difficult to express in bacteria the incorporation of unnatural amino acids peptide protein backbone modification and the synthesis of d proteins which consist of d amino acids the established method for the production of synthetic peptides in the lab is known as solid phase peptide synthesis spps pioneered by robert bruce merrifield spps allows the rapid assembly of a peptide chain through successive reactions of amino acid derivatives on

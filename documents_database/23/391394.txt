like both e and this constant is a transcendental number this was first established by gelfond and may now be considered as an application of the gelfond schneider theorem noting that where i is the imaginary unit since i is algebraic but not rational e is transcendental the constant was mentioned in hilbert s seventh problem a related constant is formula 2 known as the gelfond schneider constant the related value e is also irrational the decimal expansion of gelfond s constant begins if one defines formula 4 and for formula 6 then the sequence converges rapidly to formula 8 this is based on the digits for the simple continued fraction as given by the integer sequence the volume of the n dimensional ball or n ball is given by where formula 12 is its radius and formula 13 is the gamma function any even dimensional ball has volume and summing up all the unit ball r 1 volumes of even dimension gives this is known as ramanujan s constant it is an application of heegner numbers where 163 is the heegner number in question similar to formula 17 formula 18 is very close to an integer as it was

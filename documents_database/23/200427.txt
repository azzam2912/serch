each packet flow or connection has its own packet queue in a network interface controller it is the simplest approximation of generalized processor sharing gps while gps serves infinitesimal amounts of data from each nonempty queue wrr serves a number of packets for each nonempty queue the number of packets served is in proportion to the assigned weight and in inverse proportion to the size of the packets in wrr queuing packets are first classified into various service classes such as real time interactive and file transfer and then assigned to a queue that is specifically dedicated to that service class each of the queues is serviced in a round robin order similar to strict priority queueing and fair queuing empty queues are skipped wrr queuing is also referred to as cbq or custom queuing wrr queuing supports the allocation of different amounts of bandwidth to different service class by either wrr mechanism pseudo code wrr for network packet scheduling was first proposed by katevenis sidiropoulos and courcoubetis in 1991 specifically for scheduling in atm networks using fixed size packets cells in the more general case of ip networks with variable size packets in order to approximate gps the weight

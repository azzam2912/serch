infection causes warts papillomas and fibropapillomas of the skin and alimentary tract and more rarely cancers of the alimentary tract and urinary bladder they are also thought to cause the skin tumour equine sarcoid in horses and donkeys like other papillomaviruses bpvs are small non enveloped viruses with an icosahedral capsid around 50 60 nm in diameter the capsid is formed of the l1 and l2 structural proteins with the l1 c terminus exposed all bpvs have a circular double stranded dna genome of 7 3 8 0 kb the genetic organisation of those bpvs which have been sequenced is broadly similar to other papillomaviruses the open reading frames orfs are all located on one strand and are divided into early and late regions the early region encodes nonstructural proteins e1 to e7 there are three viral oncoproteins e5 e6 and e7 bpvs of the xipapillomavirus group lack e6 the late region encodes structural proteins l1 and l2 there is also a non coding long control region lcr six types of bpv have been characterised bpv 1 to bpv 6 which are divided into three broad subgroups a further thirteen putative bpvs have recently been identified the novel viruses have

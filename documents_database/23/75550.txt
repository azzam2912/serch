all acceleration requires an exchange of momentum which can be thought of as the unit of movement momentum is related to mass and velocity as given by the formula p mv where p is the momentum m the mass and v the velocity the velocity of a body is easily changeable but in most cases the mass is not which makes it important in rockets the total velocity change can be calculated using the tsiolkovsky rocket equation as follows formula 1 where the term working mass is used primarily in the aerospace field in more down to earth examples the working mass is typically provided by the earth which contains so much momentum in comparison to most vehicles that the amount it gains or loses can be ignored however in the case of an aircraft the working mass is the air and in the case of a rocket it is the rocket fuel itself most rocket engines use light weight fuels liquid hydrogen oxygen or kerosene accelerated to super sonic speeds however ion engines often use heavier elements like xenon as the reaction mass accelerated to much higher speeds using electric fields in many cases the working mass is separate

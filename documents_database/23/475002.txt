this gray reflects exactly 1 5th the number of photons per square unit as compared to a reference white of 90 reflectance middle gray is the universal measurement standard in photographic cameras to calibrate light meters whether in a camera or hand held the 18 gray card was conceived it is assumed that the measurement taken by a meter gives the exposure for a shot so that some of the light reflected by the object measured is equivalent to middle gray because human perception adjusts to the overall brightness level and is logarithmic rather than linear the perceived middle gray is subjective to the observer this must be kept in mind when using a camera with a built in light meter which is neither subjective nor logarithmic most scenes reflect just 12 to 13 of incident light falling upon them therefore the camera light meter assumes an 18 gray level this can easily be observed when one relies solely on the exposure given by a camera with a built in light meter when taking a snow scene the image will come out dark using an 18 gray card as an expose guide will mitigate this error in the srgb color

the jack polynomial is a homogeneous symmetric polynomial which generalizes the schur and zonal polynomials and is in turn generalized by the heckman opdam polynomials and macdonald polynomials the jack function formula 1 of an integer partition formula 2 parameter formula 3 and indefinitely many arguments formula 4 can be recursively defined as follows where the summation is over all partitions formula 7 such that the skew partition formula 8 is a horizontal strip namely where formula 13 equals formula 14 if formula 15 and formula 16 otherwise the expressions formula 17 and formula 18 refer to the conjugate partitions of formula 2 and formula 7 respectively the notation formula 21 means that the product is taken over all coordinates formula 22 of boxes in the young diagram of the partition formula 2 in 1997 f knop and s sahi gave a purely combinatorial formula for the jack polynomials formula 24 in n variables the sum is taken over all admissible tableaux of shape formula 26 and with an admissible tableau of shape formula 29 is a filling of the young diagram formula 29 with numbers 1 2 n such that for any box i j in the tableau this

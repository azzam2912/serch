the most basic version is as follows we are given n jobs j j j of varying processing times which need to be scheduled on m machines with varying processing power while trying to minimize the makespan the makespan is the total length of the schedule that is when all the jobs have finished processing the standard version of the problem is where you have n jobs j j j within each job there is a set of operations o o o which need to be processed in a specific order known as precedence constraints each operation has a specific machine that it needs to be processed on and only one operation in a job can be processed at a given time a common relaxation is the flexible job shop where each operation can be processed on any machine of a given set the machines in the set are identical this problem is one of the best known combinatorial optimization problems and was the first problem for which competitive analysis was presented by graham in 1966 best problem instances for basic model with makespan objective are due to taillard the name originally came from the scheduling of jobs in a

soil may be regarded as waterlogged when it is nearly saturated with water much of the time such that its air phase is restricted and anaerobic conditions prevail in extreme cases of prolonged waterlogging anaerobiosis occurs the roots of mesophytes suffer and the subsurface reducing atmosphere leads to such processes as denitrification methanogenesis and the reduction of iron and manganese oxides in agriculture various crops need air specifically oxygen to a greater or lesser depth in the soil waterlogging of the soil stops air getting in how near the water table must be to the surface for the ground to be classed as waterlogged varies with the purpose in view a crop s demand for freedom from waterlogging may vary between seasons of the year as with the growing of rice oryza sativa in irrigated agricultural land waterlogging is often accompanied by soil salinity as waterlogged soils prevent leaching of the salts imported by the irrigation water from a gardening point of view waterlogging is the process whereby the soil blocks off all water and is so hard it stops air getting in and it stops oxygen from getting in

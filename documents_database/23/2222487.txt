a block of memory cannot be placed randomly in the cache and is restricted to a single cache line by the placement policy in other words placement policy determines where a particular memory block can be placed when it goes into the cache there are three different policies available for placement of a memory block in the cache in a direct mapped cache structure the cache is organized into multiple sets with a single cache line per set based on the address of the memory block it can only occupy a single cache line the cache can be framed as a n 1 column matrix consider main memory of 16 kilobytes which is organized as 4 byte blocks and cache of 256 bytes with block size of 4 bytes since each cache block is of size 4 bytes the total number of sets in the cache is 256 4 which equals 64 sets the incoming address to the cache is divided into bits for offset index and tag offset corresponds to the bits used to determine the byte to be accessed from the cache line in the example the offset bits are 2 which are used to address the 4

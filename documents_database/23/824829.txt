diameters of single walled carbon nanotubes swnts and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwnts are typically 0 8 to 2 nm and 5 to 20 nm respectively although mwnt diameters can exceed 100 nm cnt lengths range from less than 100 nm to 0 5 m individual cnt walls can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the orientation of the lattice with respect to the tube axis which is called chirality mwnt s cross sectional area offers an elastic modulus approaching 1 tpa and a tensile strength of 100 gpa over 10 fold higher than any industrial fiber mwnts are typically metallic and can carry currents of up to 10 a cm swnts can display thermal conductivity of 3500 w m k exceeding that of diamond carbon nanotube production exceeded several thousand tons per year used for applications in energy storage device modelling automotive parts boat hulls sporting goods water filters thin film electronics coatings actuators and electromagnetic shields cnt related publications more than tripled in the prior decade while rates of patent issuance also increased most output was of unorganized architecture organized cnt architectures such as forests yarns and regular sheets were produced in much smaller volumes cnts have even

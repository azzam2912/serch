this object is denoted f or in a french english pun f the name field with one element and the notation f are only suggestive as there is no field with one element in classical abstract algebra instead f refers to the idea that there should be a way to replace sets and operations the traditional building blocks for abstract algebra with other more flexible objects while there is still no field with a single element in these theories there is a field like object whose characteristic is one f cannot be a field because all fields must contain two distinct elements the additive identity zero and the multiplicative identity one even if this restriction is dropped a ring with one element must be the zero ring which does not behave like a finite field instead most proposed theories of f replace abstract algebra entirely mathematical objects such as vector spaces and polynomial rings can be carried over into these new theories by mimicking their abstract properties this allows the development of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry on new foundations one of the defining features of theories of f is that these new foundations allow more objects than classical abstract

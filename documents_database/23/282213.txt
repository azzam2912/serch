it is often used in analyzing data from spectroscopy or diffraction without loss of generality we can consider only centered profiles which peak at zero the voigt profile is then where x is the shift from the line center formula 5 is the centered gaussian profile and formula 7 is the centered lorentzian profile the defining integral can be evaluated as where re w z is the real part of the faddeeva function evaluated for in spectroscopy a voigt profile results from the convolution of two broadening mechanisms one of which alone would produce a gaussian profile usually as a result of the doppler broadening and the other would produce a lorentzian profile voigt profiles are common in many branches of spectroscopy and diffraction due to the computational expense of the convolution operation the voigt profile is often approximated using a pseudo voigt profile the voigt profile is normalized since it is a convolution of normalized profiles the lorentzian profile has no moments other than the zeroth and so the moment generating function for the cauchy distribution is not defined it follows that the voigt profile will not have a moment generating function either but the characteristic function for the

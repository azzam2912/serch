it is developed using the net framework imprint allows users to create discrete event simulations as visual task networks with logic defined using the c programming language imprint is primarily used by the united states department of defense to simulate the cognitive workload of its personnel when interacting with new and existing technology to determine manpower requirements and evaluate human performance imprint uses a task network a series of functions which decompose into tasks to create human performance models functions and tasks in imprint models usually represent atomic units of larger human or system behaviors one of imprint s main features is its ability to model human workload users can specify visual auditory cognitive and psychomotor workload levels for individual tasks which can measure overall workload for humans in the system and influence task performance the imprint tool grew out of common u s air force navy and army manpower personnel and training mpt concerns identified in the mid 1970s how to estimate mpt constraints and requirements early in system acquisition and how to enter those considerations into the design and decision making process the u s navy first developed the hardman hardware vs manpower comparability methodology hcm the army

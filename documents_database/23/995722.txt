animal micrornas are transcribed as pri mirna primary mirna of varying length which in turns are processed in the nucleus by drosha into 70 nucleotide stem loop precursor called pre mirna precursor mirna and subsequently processed by the dicer enzyme to give a mature 22 nucleotide product in this case the mature sequence comes from both the 3 mir 30 and 5 mir 97 6 arms of the precursor the products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mrna a screen of 17 mirnas that have been predicted to regulate a number of breast cancer associated genes found variations in the micrornas mir 17 and mir 30c 1 these patients were noncarriers of brca1 or brca2 mutations lending the possibility that familial breast cancer may be caused by variation in these mirnas members of the mir 30 family have been found to be highly expressed in heart cells it has been shown that the integrin itgb3 and the ubiquitin conjugating e2 enzyme ubc9 are downregulated by mir 30 it has also been suggested that the tp53 protein may be a target of mir 30c and mir 30e an immunoblot analysis revealed that p53 expression levels were elevated upon

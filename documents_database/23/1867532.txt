it is unclear when the first palestinian immigrants arrived into the united states later immigrants came to the country fleeing the israeli palestinian conflict the first palestinians who immigrated to the united states arrived after 1908 when the ottoman empire passed a new conscription law mandating palestinians into the military these palestinians were overwhelmingly christians and only a minority of them were muslims palestinian immigration began to decline after 1924 with a new law limiting the number of immigrants as well as the great depression which deeply worsened immigration the population in the united states began to increase after world war ii the 1948 arab israeli war the nakba and the independence of the state of israel in 1948 caused many palestinians to immigrate most as refugees however the greatest wave of palestinian immigration began in 1967 after the six day war or as middle easterners and north africans call it the june war this wave of immigrants reached its peak in the 1980s after the immigration and nationality act of 1965 was enacted many palestinians started immigrating again into the united states most palestinians that immigrated to the united states in this period were more educated than the palestinians

it is used to determine the reliability i e reproducibility of measurements under specific conditions it is particularly useful for assessing the reliability of performance assessments it was originally introduced in cronbach l j nageswari r gleser g c 1963 in g theory sources of variation are referred to as facets facets are similar to the factors used in analysis of variance and may include persons raters items forms time and settings among other possibilities these facets are potential sources of error and the purpose of generalizability theory is to quantify the amount of error caused by each facet and interaction of facets the usefulness of data gained from a g study is crucially dependent on the design of the study therefore the researcher must carefully consider the ways in which he she hopes to generalize any specific results is it important to generalize from one setting to a larger number of settings from one rater to a larger number of raters from one set of items to a larger set of items the answers to these questions will vary from one researcher to the next and will drive the design of a g study in different ways in addition

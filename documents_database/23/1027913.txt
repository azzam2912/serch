the competition has its origins in a four nation european cup held in 1988 but did not become an official fira competition until 1995 the competition has grown significantly and is some years attracts sufficient entrants for it to be divided into two pools a and b with the eight highest ranked entrants in any year based on rugby europe rankings in pool a since 2000 only the winner of the tournament held in between the world cups every four years as highlighted is officially recognised european champions although teams winning tournaments in other years are often unofficially also described as european champions this can cause some confusion not least because the structure of the four yearly tournament is invariably identical to the annual event to make identification easier the competitions in the four yearly cycle are highlighted the only major difference between the official european championships and other tournaments is that in the latter between 2001 and 2007 england and france tended not to send their full strength national squads to the competition though until 2007 they still played as england or france this has resulted in some confusion about the status of games played by these nations england

the block size was variable so it was usually used for segment based memory management it supported the mapping of up to 96 memory segments or pages of a variable size from logical to physical addresses to allow more segments or pages the simultaneous use of up 3 mc68451 mmus was officially supported in combination with a mc68010 the mc68451 permitted the realization of virtual memory with the earlier mc68000 this was not possible due to a design error in the way the mc68000 treated memory access errors i e processor state could not always be properly restored after a page fault the limitation to 96 segment table entries made systems based on a mc68010 and a mc68451 slow as they often had to modify the segment table due to its small size some companies e g h berthold ag therefore used 12 mc68451 mmus together others e g sun microsystems used their own proprietary mmus instead of the mc68451 a small massachusetts workstation company apollo computer used two 68000 processors running concurrently one was running a single instruction behind so that when a processor fault occurred the cpus could switch places and the second cpu could take over processing

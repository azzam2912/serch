the members of the families are thought to be fragments of past asteroid collisions an asteroid family is a more specific term than asteroid group whose members while sharing some broad orbital characteristics may be otherwise unrelated to each other large prominent families contain several hundred recognized asteroids and many more smaller objects which may be either not yet analyzed or not yet discovered small compact families may have only about ten identified members about 33 to 35 of asteroids in the main belt are family members there are about 20 to 30 reliably recognized families with several tens of less certain groupings most asteroid families are found in the main asteroid belt although several family like groups such as the pallas family hungaria family and the phocaea family lie at smaller semi major axis or larger inclination than the main belt one family has been identified associated with the dwarf planet some studies have tried to find evidence of collisional families among the trojan asteroids but at present the evidence is inconclusive the families are thought to form as a result of collisions between asteroids in many or most cases the parent body was shattered but there are also

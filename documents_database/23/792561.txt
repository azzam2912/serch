in a classification procedure the class for a new object whose real class is unknown can be estimated by minimising across classes an average of the fisher kernel distance from the new object to each known member of the given class the fisher kernel was introduced in 1998 it combines the advantages of generative statistical models like the hidden markov model and those of discriminative methods like support vector machines the fisher kernel makes use of the fisher score defined as with being a set vector of parameters the function taking to log p x is the log likelihood of the probabilistic model the fisher kernel is defined as with formula 3 being the fisher information matrix the fisher kernel is the kernel for a generative probabilistic model as such it constitutes a bridge between generative and probabilistic models of documents fisher kernels exist for numerous models notably tf idf naive bayes and probabilistic latent semantic analysis the fisher kernel can also be applied to image representation for classification or retrieval problems currently the most popular bag of visual words representation suffers from sparsity and high dimensionality the fisher kernel can result in a compact and dense representation which is

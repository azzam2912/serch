the canal would have attempted to resolve a problem with the quality of water pumped south pumps create such a powerful suction that the boundary between freshwater to saltwater has shifted inland negatively affecting the environment the pumps have increased by the amount of water exported each year to the central valley and southern california however the peripheral canal as proposed would have reduced the overall freshwater flow into the delta and move the freshwater saltwater interface further inland causing damage to delta agriculture and ecosystems before the central valley project and state water project were built all freshwater primarily runoff from the sierra nevada entering the sacramento san joaquin river delta flowed into san francisco bay after the pumps powering the central valley project and state water project became operational the freshwater was drawn from the delta cross channel through a maze of river channels and sloughs before entering the clifton court forebay north of tracy where water is pumped into the california aqueduct and the delta mendota canal large numbers of delta smelt and other endangered species are killed by the pumping plants which provide water for the aqueducts freshwater flowing into the delta displaces salt water entering

it is the average distance from the center of earth to the center of the moon more technically it is the mean semi major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit it may also refer to the time averaged distance between the centers of the earth and the moon or less commonly the instantaneous earth moon distance the mean semi major axis has a value of the time averaged distance between earth and moon centers is the actual distance varies over the course of the orbit of the moon from at the perigee to at apogee resulting in a differential range of lunar distance is commonly used to express the distance to near earth object encounters lunar distance is also an important astronomical datum the precision of this measurement to a few parts in a trillion has implications for testing gravitational theories such as general relativity and for refining other astronomical values such as earth mass earth radius and earth s rotation the measurement is also useful in characterizing the lunar radius the mass of the sun and the distance to the sun millimeter precision measurements of the lunar distance are made by measuring the time taken for light to travel

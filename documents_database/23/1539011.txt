he gave his name to the later kingdom of seisyllwg which consisted of ceredigion plus the region known as ystrad tywi as such he was possibly the king responsible for the expansion however there is no contemporary evidence of this and almost nothing is known of his life or reign seisyll appears in the harleian genealogies for the kings of ceredigion here he is named as the son of clydog or clitauc artgloys and is the sixth in descent from ceredig the traditional founder of ceredigion the harleian also names him as the father of arthgen presumably the king of ceredigion whom the annales cambriae record as dying in 807 seisyll s name appears to derive from the notional late latin saxillus which comes from the same root as the welsh sais meaning saxon or englishman seisyll ap clydog is generally taken to be the seisyll for whom seisyllwg was named as such historians such as john edward lloyd and egerton phillimore believed that he was the king who founded that kingdom however contemporary sources continue to use the name ceredigion for the realm of seisyll and his successors as such seisyllwg may represent a substantially later political development

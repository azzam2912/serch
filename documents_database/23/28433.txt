v hill was an english physiologist one of the founders of the diverse disciplines of biophysics and operations research he shared the 1922 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his elucidation of the production of heat and mechanical work in muscles born in bristol he was educated at blundell s school and graduated from trinity college cambridge as third wrangler in the mathematics tripos before turning to physiology while still an undergraduate at trinity college he derived in 1909 what came to be known as the langmuir equation this is closely related to michaelis menten kinetics in this paper hill s first publication he derived both the equilibrium form of the langmuir equation and also the exponential approach to equilibrium the paper written under the supervision of john newport langley is a landmark in the history of receptor theory because the context for the derivation was the binding of nicotine and curare to the receptive substance at the neuromuscular junction hill made many exacting measurements of the heat released when skeletal muscles contract and relax a key finding was that heat is produced during contraction which requires investment of chemical energy but not during relaxation which is passive his

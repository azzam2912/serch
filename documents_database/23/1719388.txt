a classification system for glycoside hydrolases based on sequence similarity has led to the definition of 100 different families this classification is available on the cazy web site and also discussed at cazypedia an online encyclopedia of carbohydrate active enzymes glycoside hydrolase family 56 cazy gh 56 includes enzymes with hyaluronidase activity the venom of apis mellifera honeybee contains several biologically active peptides and two enzymes one of which is a hyaluronidase the amino acid sequence of bee venom hyaluronidase contains 349 amino acids and includes four cysteines and a number of potential glycosylation sites the sequence shows a high degree of similarity to ph 20 a membrane protein of mammalian sperm involved in sperm egg adhesion supporting the view that hyaluronidases play a role in fertilisation ph 20 is required for sperm adhesion to the egg zona pellucida it is located on both the sperm plasma membrane and acrosomal membrane the amino acid sequence of the mature protein contains 468 amino acids and includes six potential n linked glycosylation sites and twelve cysteines eight of which are tightly clustered near the c terminus

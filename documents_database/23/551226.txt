this is done to increase fuel efficiency while under varying loads variable compression engines allow the volume above the piston at top dead centre to be changed higher loads require lower ratios to increase power while lower loads need higher ratios to increase efficiency i e to lower fuel consumption for automotive use this needs to be done as the engine is running in response to the load and driving demands the 2019 infiniti qx 50 is the first commercially available car that uses a variable compression ratio engine gasoline engines have a limit on the maximum pressure during the compression stroke after which the fuel air mixture detonates rather than burns to achieve higher power outputs at the same speed more fuel must be burned and therefore more air is needed to achieve this turbochargers or superchargers are used to increase the inlet pressure this would result in detonation of the fuel air mixture unless the compression ratio was decreased i e the volume above the piston made greater this can be done to a greater or lesser extent with massive increases in power being possible the down side of this is that under light loading the engine can

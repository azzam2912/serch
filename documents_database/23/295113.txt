this is because a firm in a competitive market will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm s sales can never impact the industry s price however a monopoly determines the entire industry s sales as a result it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit therefore the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells the marginal revenue the increase in total revenue is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price a firm s profits will be maximized when marginal revenue mr equals marginal cost mc if formula 1 then a profit maximizing firm will increase output for more profit while if formula 2 then the firm will decrease output for additional profit thus the firm will choose the profit maximizing output level as

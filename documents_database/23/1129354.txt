nucleoporins are the main components of the nuclear pore complex in eukaryotic cells this gene is a member of the fg repeat containing nucleoporins the protein encoded by this gene is localized to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex where it is required for proper cell cycle progression and nucleocytoplasmic transport the 3 portion of this gene forms a fusion gene with the dek gene on chromosome 6 in a t 6 9 translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome the structure of the n terminal domain of nup214 reveals a sevenbladed beta propeller fold followed by a 30 residue c terminal extended peptide segment cte the cte folds back onto the beta propeller and binds to its bottom face the structure of the nup214 ntd bound to the helicase ddx19 in its adp bound state reveals the molecular basis for the interaction between the two proteins a conserved residue of ddx19 is shown to be crucial for complex formation in vitro and in vivo strikingly the interaction surfaces exhibit strongly opposing surface potentials with the helicase surface being positively and the nup214 surface being negatively charged ddx19 is shown to bind rna only in its

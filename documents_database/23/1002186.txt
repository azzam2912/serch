the book puts forward a set of policies and strategies for implementing the most promising clean energy technologies by all spheres of government business and community organisations greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy suggests that a mix of efficient energy use renewable energy sources and natural gas as a transitional fuel offers a clean and feasible energy future for australia the book is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems and is structured in three sections diesendorf argues that early in his career mark diesendorf was a principal research scientist with csiro where he was involved in early research on integrating wind power into electricity grids this issue is discussed in some detail in greenhouse solutions with sustainable energy diesendorf explains that large scale wind power is not intermittent because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously in practice the variations in thousands of wind turbines spread out over several different sites and wind regimes are smoothed as the distance between sites increases the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites decreases this has been confirmed recently by studies conducted by graham sinden from oxford university graham sinden analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from

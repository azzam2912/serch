muc1 is a glycoprotein with extensive o linked glycosylation of its extracellular domain mucins line the apical surface of epithelial cells in the lungs stomach intestines eyes and several other organs mucins protect the body from infection by pathogen binding to oligosaccharides in the extracellular domain preventing the pathogen from reaching the cell surface overexpression of muc1 is often associated with colon breast ovarian lung and pancreatic cancers joyce taylor papadimitriou identified and characterised the antigen during her work with breast and ovarian tumors muc1 is a member of the mucin family and encodes a membrane bound glycosylated phosphoprotein muc1 has a core protein mass of 120 225 kda which increases to 250 500 kda with glycosylation it extends 200 500 nm beyond the surface of the cell the protein is anchored to the apical surface of many epithelia by a transmembrane domain beyond the transmembrane domain is a sea domain that contains a cleavage site for release of the large extracellular domain the release of mucins is performed by sheddases the extracellular domain includes a 20 amino acid variable number tandem repeat vntr domain with the number of repeats varying from 20 to 120 in different individuals these repeats

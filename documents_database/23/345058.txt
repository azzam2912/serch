this particular phospholipase specifically recognizes the sn 2 acyl bond of phospholipids and catalytically hydrolyzes the bond releasing arachidonic acid and lysophosphatidic acid upon downstream modification by cyclooxygenases or lipoxygenases arachidonic acid is modified into active compounds called eicosanoids eicosanoids include prostaglandins and leukotrienes which are categorized as anti inflammatory and inflammatory mediators pla2 enzymes are commonly found in mammalian tissues as well as arachnid insect and snake venom venom from both snakes and insects is largely composed of melittin which is a stimulant of pla2 due to the increased presence and activity of pla2 resulting from a snake or insect bite arachidonic acid is released from the phospholipid membrane disproportionately as a result inflammation and pain occur at the site there are also prokaryotic a2 phospholipases additional types of phospholipases include phospholipase a1 phospholipase b phospholipase c and phospholipase d phospholipases a2 include several unrelated protein families with common enzymatic activity two most notable families are secreted and cytosolic phospholipases a2 other families include ca independent pla2 ipla2 and lipoprotein associated pla2s lp pla2 also known as platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase paf ah the extracellular forms of phospholipases a2 have been isolated from different venoms snake bee and wasp

its primary ingredients are red phosphorus and strong oxidizer such as potassium chlorate and potassium perchlorate sulfur is used to substitute for some or all of the phosphorus to slightly decrease sensitivity and lower costs calcium carbonate may also be present in small proportions commercially armstrong s mixture is used in milligram quantities on the paper caps in toy cap guns and in party poppers an improvised version can be made with match heads ground up into a fine powder and mixed with another fine powder this time made of the striker strip found on the side of match boxes it has also been considered a suitable mixture for the primer used in guns after boron carbide has been added and was used during the second world war because of its sensitivity to shock friction and flame armstrong s mixture is an extremely dangerous explosive only about 10 mg of it is used per item of consumer fireworks depending on composition conditions and quantity armstrong s mixture can explode violently in an enclosed space due to extreme sensitivity to friction mixing dry potassium chlorate and red phosphorus will most likely lead to an explosion hence the ingredients are usually combined

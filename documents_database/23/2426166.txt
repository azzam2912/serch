it is encoded by the c7orf57 gene this gene is found to be greatly expressed in the fallopian tubes testes lungs hippocampus hypothalamus and caudate there are three isoforms of the gene within the gene sequence 9 exons are present c7orf57 has been linked to lupus pancreatic cancer sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and gastrointestinal toxicity there are three isoforms of c7orf57 isoform 1 is the longest of the three with 2102 residues and 9 exons the protein sequence is 295 base pairs its locus is 7p12 3 it is often found in nuclear and mitochondrial sub cellular locations c7orf57 has a promoter upstream of its transcription site as found in genomatix the promoter is 1125 base pairs long located between 48024511 48025635 it codes for six transcripts of c7orf57 there are many phosphorylation sites found on the protein mostly on serine and threonine there are also many glycosylation sites c7orf57 does not have a known secondary structure though it is predicted to consist mainly of random coils with some alpha helixes it is predicted to be similar in structure to phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase c7orf57 has increased expressed in the larynx testis fallopian tubes lungs and parts of the brain it is

rather cell mediated immunity is the activation of phagocytes antigen specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes and the release of various cytokines in response to antigen historically the immune system was separated into two branches humoral immunity for which the protective function of immunization could be found in the humor cell free bodily fluid or serum and cellular immunity for which the protective function of immunization was associated with cells cd4 cells or helper t cells provide protection against different pathogens naive t cells mature t cells that have yet to encounter an antigen are converted into activated effector t cells after encountering antigen presenting cells apcs these apcs such as macrophages dendritic cells and b cells in some circumstances load antigenic peptides onto the mhc of the cell in turn presenting the peptide to receptors on t cells the most important of these apcs are highly specialized dendritic cells conceivably operating solely to ingest and present antigens activated effector t cells can be placed into three functioning classes detecting peptide antigens originating from various types of pathogen the first class being 1 cytotoxic t cells which kill infected target cells by apoptosis without using cytokines 2 th1 cells which primarily function

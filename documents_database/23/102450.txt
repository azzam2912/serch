if formula 4 is a finite dimensional vector space then a linear map formula 5 is called diagonalizable if there exists an ordered basis of formula 4 with respect to which formula 7 is represented by a diagonal matrix diagonalization is the process of finding a corresponding diagonal matrix for a diagonalizable matrix or linear map a square matrix that is not diagonalizable is called defective diagonalizable matrices and maps are of interest because diagonal matrices are especially easy to handle once their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known one can raise a diagonal matrix to a power by simply raising the diagonal entries to that same power and the determinant of a diagonal matrix is simply the product of all diagonal entries geometrically a diagonalizable matrix is an inhomogeneous dilation or anisotropic scaling it scales the space as does a homogeneous dilation but by a different factor in each direction determined by the scale factors on each axis diagonal entries a square formula 8 matrix formula 1 over a field formula 10 is called diagonalizable or nondefective if there exists an invertible matrix formula 2 such that formula 3 is a diagonal matrix formally the fundamental fact about diagonalizable maps

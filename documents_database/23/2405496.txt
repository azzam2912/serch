degree in chemistry from massachusetts institute of technology in 1980 subsequently he obtained his ph d degree in chemistry from the university of california berkeley in 1985 petek has developed coherent photoelectron spectroscopy and microscopy as methods for studying the dephasing and spatial propagation of polarization fields in solid state materials and nanostructure he is developing methods for multidimensional multiphoton photoemission spectroscopy together with jin zhao ken jordan and ken onda petek also discovered wet electron states where electrons are partially solvated by water and other protic solvents at molecule vacuum interfaces together with min feng and jin zhao petek discovered atom like superatom states of c60 and similar hollow molecules petek s research with shijing tan has involved studies of metal plasmon excitations with semiconductor substrates where the charge injection from highly optically active plasmonic modes into semiconductor substrates could be used for solar energy harvesting petek is editor in chief of progress in surface science and has organized conferences in his research field such as the 11th international symposium of ultrafast surface dynamics to be held in qiandao lake china petek has been 2015 2019 a member of the national research and development agency committee for the national

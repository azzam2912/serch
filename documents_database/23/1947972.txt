the general formula of rp phase is abx where a and b are cations x is an anion e g oxygen and n is the number of the layers of octahedra in the perovskite like stack generally it has a phase structure that results from the intergrowth of perovskite type and nacl type i e rocksalt type structures the structure was named after s n ruddlesden and p popper who first synthesized and described the structure in 1957 the general rp formula abx can be represented as aa bx where a and a represent alkali alkaline earth or rare earth metal while b refers to transition metal the a cations are located in the perovskite layer and have a 12 fold cuboctahedral coordination to the anions cn 12 the a cations have a coordination number of 9 cn 9 and are located at the boundary between the perovskite layer and an intermediate block layer the b cations are located inside the anionic octahedral pyramids and squares the first series of ruddlesden popper phase srtio camno and srlaalo were confirmed by powder x ray diffraction pxrd in 1957 these compounds were formed by heating up the appropriate oxide or carbonate in

after environment canada formally supported the initiative in 1991 the aret stakeholder committee was formed to participate in the program the committee consisted of representatives from industry provincial and federal governments health and environmental groups and labour organizations the committee first evaluated a list of over 2000 chemicals scoring them on the basis of toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation capability by 1994 the evaluation was complete and a resulting list of 117 toxic substances were slated by the committee for voluntary elimination or reduction by the year 2000 the success of the aret program is disputed while environment canada states that over 70 000 tonnes of toxic substances were prevented from release because of the success of the program the multi stakeholder nature of the committee lead to disagreements over which substances would be given priority environmental and labour groups withdrew from the committee over the emphasis placed on reductions rather than eliminations of these substances by industry representatives nils axel braathen also claims that knowing to what extent the reductions were actual improvements from the business as usual reduction scenario is very difficult meaning that the net environmental benefits were questionable

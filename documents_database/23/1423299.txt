when a voltage is applied to these probes electrons are emitted from the tips through a process known as field electron emission when a body is subjected to ion milling in vacuum we do not get to know about the geometry of the surface of the body so to study it we will keep the field emission probes which will emit electrons as soon as a voltage is applied across it this in turn will cause emission of secondary electrons from the surface of the body that is subjected to ion milling by collecting these secondary emitted electrons we get a clear image of the surface of the ion milled body this is the technique that is used in the or scanning electron microscope sem there exist various well defined techniques for preparing field emission probes ideally a field emission probe should be extremely sharp possibly terminating in a single atom in order to resolve details at the atomic level it should have a small aspect ratio to reduce mechanical vibration while scanning have a stable atomic configuration at its apex to yield reliable and reproducible images and be clean to ensure a stable tunnel junction since the presence of

it is commonly used for protein production in escherichia coli pichia pastoris and similar analytical operations including the ones leading to processes like molecular cloning two hybrid promoters functional in escherichia coli were constructed these hybrid promoters taci and tacii were derived from sequences of the trp and the lac uv5 promoters in the first hybrid promoter taci the dna upstream of position 20 with respect to the transcriptional start site was derived from the trp promoter the dna downstream of position 20 was derived from the lac uv5 promoter in the second hybrid promoter tacii the dna upstream of position 11 at the hpa i site within the pribnow box was derived from the trp promoter the dna downstream of position 11 is a 46 base pair synthetic dna fragment that specifies part of the hybrid pribnow box and the entire lac operator it also specifies a shine dalgarno sequence flanked by two unique restriction sites portable shine dalgarno sequence the taci and the tacii promoters respectively direct transcription approximately 11 and 7 times more efficiently than the derepressed parental lac uv5 promoter and approximately 3 and 2 times more efficiently than the trp promoter in the absence of

it constitutes one of the largest stonefly families containing some 300 species distributed throughout the holarctic their closest relatives are the rolled winged stoneflies leuctridae many species are endemic to small ranges perhaps due to the family s tendency to evolve tolerance for cold isolating populations in mountain valleys and winglessness inhibiting dispersal indeed some wingless capniidae e g the lake tahoe benthic stonefly capnia lacustra capnia is not monophyletic and this species is suspected to belong elsewhere or baikaloperla spp spend their entire lifecycles under water and do not disperse from their native lakes at all adult capniidae as their common name implies are typically small plecoptera while most are less than 1 cm long with some measuring just 4 mm as adults a few are as large as at adulthood the adults emerge from the water in winter and are often found walking around on the snow characteristic are the wings with at most one cubital crossvein and the paraprocts anal lobes the inner lobes of which form a tube closed on the underside by the outer lobes nymphs of small winter stoneflies typically have very elongated and slender bodies similar to those of leuctridae however the groove

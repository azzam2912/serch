on very long timescales exchanges of angular momentum with planet nine cause the perihelia of anti aligned objects to rise until their precession reverses direction maintaining their anti alignment and later fall returning them to their original orbits on shorter timescales mean motion resonances with planet nine provides phase protection which stabilizes their orbits by slightly altering the objects semi major axes keeping their orbits synchronized with planet nine s and preventing close approaches the inclination of planet nine s orbit weakens this protection resulting in a chaotic variation of semi major axes as objects hop between resonances the orbital poles of the objects circle that of the solar system s laplace plane which at large semi major axes is warped toward the plane of planet nine s orbit causing their poles to be clustered toward one side the anti alignment and the raising of the perihelia of extreme trans neptunian objects with semi major axes greater than 250 au is produced by the secular effects of planet nine secular effects act on timescales much longer than orbital periods so the perturbations two objects exert on each other are the average between all possible configurations effectively the interactions become like

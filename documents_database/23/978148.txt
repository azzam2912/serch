n luzin is an uncountable topological t space without isolated points in which every nowhere dense subset is countable there are many minor variations of this definition in use the t condition can be replaced by t or t and some authors allow a countable or even arbitrary number of isolated points the existence of a luzin space is independent of the axioms of zfc showed that the continuum hypothesis implies that a luzin space exists in real analysis and descriptive set theory a luzin set or lusin set is defined as an uncountable subset of the reals such that every uncountable subset of is nonmeager that is of second baire category equivalently is an uncountable set of reals which meets every first category set in only countably many points luzin proved that if the continuum hypothesis holds then every nonmeager set has a luzin subset obvious properties of a luzin set are that it must be nonmeager otherwise the set itself is an uncountable meager subset and of measure zero because every set of positive measure contains a meager set which also has positive measure and is therefore uncountable a weakly luzin set is an uncountable subset of a

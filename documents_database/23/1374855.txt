a lagrangian description of a system such as the atmosphere focuses on following individual air parcels along their trajectories as opposed to the eulerian description which considers the rate of change of system variables fixed at a particular point in space a semi lagrangian scheme uses eulerian framework but the discrete equations come from the lagrangian perspective the lagrangian rate of change of a quantity formula 1 is given by formula 2 where formula 1 can be a scalar or vector field and formula 4 is the velocity field the first term on the right hand side of the above equation is the local or eulerian rate of change of formula 1 and the second term is often called the advection term note that the lagrangian rate of change is also known as the material derivative it can be shown that the equations governing atmospheric motion can be written in the lagrangian form formula 6 where the components of the vector formula 7 are the dependent variables describing a parcel of air such as velocity pressure temperature etc and the function formula 8 represents source and or sink terms in a lagrangian scheme individual air parcels are traced but there

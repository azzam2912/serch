the compound consists of three butyl groups connected to an amine center in which all of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced with fluorine the compound is produced for the electronics industry along with other perfluoroalkylamines unlike ordinary amines perfluoroamines are nonbasic it is prepared by electrofluorination of tributylamine using hydrogen fluoride as solvent and source of fluorine the compound has two commercial uses it is used as an ingredient in fluosol artificial blood this application exploits the high solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the solvent as well as the low viscosity and toxicity it is also a component of fluorinert coolant liquids cpus of some computers are immersed in this liquid to facilitate cooling the compound is used as a calibrant in gas chromatography when the analytical technique uses mass spectrometry as a detector to identify and quantify chemical compounds in gases or liquids when undergoing ionization in the mass spectrometer the compound decomposes in a repeatable pattern to form fragments of specific masses which can be used to tune the mass response and accuracy of the mass spectrometer most commonly used ions are those with approximate mass of 69 131 219 414 and 502 atomic mass

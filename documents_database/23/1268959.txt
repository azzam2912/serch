hodoscopes are characterized by being made up of many segments the combination of which segments record a detection is then used to infer where the particle passed through hodoscope the typical detector segment is a piece of scintillating material which emits light when a particle passes through it the scintillation light can be converted to an electrical signal either by a photomultiplier tube pmt or a pin diode if a segment measures some significant amount of light the experimenter can infer that a particle passed through that segment in addition to coordinate information for some systems the strength of the light can be proportional to the deposited energy by doing necessary calibrations the deposited energy can be determined which then can be used to infer information about the original particle s energy as an example a simple hodoscope might be used to determine where a particle crossed a plane or a wall in this case the experimenter could use two segments shaped like strips arranged in two layers one layer of strips could be arranged horizontally while a second layer could be arranged vertically a particle passing through the wall would hit a strip in each layer the vertical strip

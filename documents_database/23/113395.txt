it stands in contrast to the concept of intensionality which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same consider the two functions f and g mapping from and to natural numbers defined as follows these functions are extensionally equal given the same input both functions always produce the same value but the definitions of the functions are not equal and in that intensional sense the functions are not the same similarly in natural language there are many predicates relations that are intensionally different but are extensionally identical for example suppose that a town has one person named joe who is also the oldest person in the town then the two argument predicates has one person named is the oldest person in are intensionally distinct but extensionally equal for joe in that town now the extensional definition of function equality discussed above is commonly used in mathematics sometimes additional information is attached to a function such as an explicit codomain in which case two functions must not only agree on all values but must also have the same codomain in order to be equal a similar extensional definition is usually employed for relations two relations are said

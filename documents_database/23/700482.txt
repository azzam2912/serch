mathematics has been connected with science logic with greek but both have developed in modern times logic has become more mathematical and mathematics has become more logical the consequence is that it has now become wholly impossible to draw a line between the two in fact the two are one they differ as boy and man logic is the youth of mathematics and mathematics is the manhood of logic this view is resented by logicians who having spent their time in the study of classical texts are incapable of following a piece of symbolic reasoning and by mathematicians who have learnt a technique without troubling to inquire into its meaning or justification both types are now fortunately growing rarer so much of modern mathematical work is obviously on the border line of logic so much of modern logic is symbolic and formal that the very close relationship of logic and mathematics has become obvious to every instructed student the proof of their identity is of course a matter of detail starting with premises which would be universally admitted to belong to logic and arriving by deduction at results which as obviously belong to mathematics we find that there is no

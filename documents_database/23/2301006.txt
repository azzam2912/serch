atoms at the edges of a graphene sheet have special chemical reactivity graphene has the highest ratio of edge atoms of any allotrope defects within a sheet increase its chemical reactivity the onset temperature of reaction between the basal plane of single layer graphene and oxygen gas is below graphene combusts at graphene is commonly modified with oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy however determination of structures of graphene with oxygen and nitrogen functional groups requires the structures to be well controlled contrary to the ideal 2d structure of graphene chemical applications of graphene need either structural or chemical irregularities as perfectly flat graphene is chemically inert in other words the definition of an ideal graphene is different in chemistry and physics graphene placed on a soda lime glass slg substrate under ambient conditions exhibited spontaneous n doping 1 33 10 e cm via surface transfer on p type copper indium gallium diselenide cigs semiconductor itself deposited on slg n doping reached 2 11 10 e cm using paper making techniques on dispersed oxidized and chemically processed graphite in water monolayer flakes form a single sheet and create strong bonds

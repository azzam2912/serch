roughly one quarter of the individuals are pied with dark and white feathers and the rest known as bronze shags are dark all over both morphs breed together these large chunky birds are about 70 cm long weigh about 2 3 kg and are slightly larger than foveaux shags they can be distinguished from foveaux shags by their facial ornamentation in the breeding season foveaux shags have dark orange papillae on their face whereas otago shags have both papillae and small bright orange facial caruncles above the base of the bill until 2016 otago shags and the closely related shags living around stewart island and foveaux strait were considered to be a single species called the stewart island shag mitochondrial dna suggests otago shags are actually more closely related to chatham shags leucocarbo onslowi and osteological and genetic differences supported separating off foveaux shags as a distinct species l stewarti foveaux and otago shags probably diverged when populations were split up by lower sea levels in the pleistocene and the chatham islands were subsequently colonised by shags from otago other taxonomists have kept the otago shag and the foveaux shag conspecific a recent taxonomic revision argues that leucocarbo is a

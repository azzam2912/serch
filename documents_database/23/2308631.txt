seawater is full of dissolved compounds ions and nutrients that organisms can utilize for energy and in the case of calcification to build shells and outer structures calcifying organisms in the ocean include molluscs foraminifera coccolithophores crustaceans echinoderms such as sea urchins and corals the shells and skeletons produced from calcification have important functions for the physiology and ecology of the organisms that create them the ocean is the largest sink or reservoir of atmospheric carbon dioxide co continually taking in carbon from the air this co is then dissolved and reacts with water to form carbonic acid which reacts further to generate carbonate co bicarbonate hco and hydrogen h ions the saturation state of seawater refers to how saturated or unsaturated the water is with these ions and this determines if an organism will calcify or if the already calcified crystals will dissolve the saturation state for calcium carbonate caco can be determined using the equation ca co k where the numerator denotes the concentrations of calcium ions to carbonate ions and the denominator k refers to the stoichiometric solubility product for the mineral solid phase of calcium carbonate when the saturation state is high organisms can extract the

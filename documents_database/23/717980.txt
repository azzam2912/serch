one savart is equal to one thousandth of a decade 10 1 3 986 313714 cents 3 9863 cents musically in just intonation the interval of a decade is precisely a just major twenty fourth or in other words three octaves and a just major third today the savart has largely been replaced by the cent and the millioctave the savart is practically the same as the earlier heptameride eptameride one seventh of a meride one tenth of an heptameride is a decameride and a hundredth of an heptameride thousandth of a decade is approximately one jot if formula 1 is the ratio of frequencies of a given interval the corresponding measure in savarts is given by formula 2 or formula 3 like the more common cent the savart is a logarithmic measure and thus intervals can be added by simply adding their savart values instead of multiplying them as you would frequencies the number of savarts in an octave is 1000 times the base 10 logarithm of 2 or nearly 301 03 sometimes this is rounded to 300 which makes the unit more useful for equal temperament the conversion from savarts into cents or millioctaves is formula 4 formula

here the pacific plate is being subducted underneath the north american plate and the rate of subduction changes from west to east from 7 5 cm yr to 5 1 cm yr the aleutian subduction zone includes two prominent features the aleutian arc and the aleutian trench the island arc was created via volcanic eruptions from dehydration of the subducting slab at 100 km depth the trench is a narrow and deep morphology that occurs between the two converging plates as the subucting slab dives beneath the overriding plate the aleutian island arc formed 50 55 ma as a result of kula plate subduction under the north american plate before the pacific plate arrived there are three stratigraphic units of the aleutian island arc volcanic rocks from 55 33 ma marine sedimentary rocks from 23 33 ma and sedimentary and igneous rocks from 5 ma present volcanic rocks from 55 33 ma include sandstone siltstone conglomerate and breccia that are all volcanic and they are mixed with pillow lavas in a complex way debris flows and turbidity currents transported igneous materials from volcanic source to shallow marine basins the majority of the volcanism occurred between 56 34 ma along the

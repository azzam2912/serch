fine theoretical physics institute university of minnesota shifman is known for a number of basic contributions to quantum chromodynamics the theory of strong interactions and to understanding of supersymmetric gauge dynamics the most important results due to m shifman are diverse and include i the discovery of the penguin mechanism in the flavor changing weak decays 1974 ii introduction of the gluon condensate and development of the svz sum rules relating properties of the low lying hadronic states to the vacuum condensates 1979 iii introduction of the invisible axion 1980 iv first exact results in supersymmetric yang mills theories nsvz beta function gluino condensate 1983 1988 v heavy quark theory based on the operator product expansion 1985 1995 vi critical domain walls d brane analogs in super yang mills 1996 vii non perturbative exact planar equivalence between super yang mills and orientifold non supersymmetric theories 2003 viii non abelian flux tubes and confined monopoles 2004 till present his paper with a vainshtein and zakharov on the svz sum rules is among the all time top cited papers in high energy physics mikhail shifman received the alexander von humboldt award in 1993 the sakurai prize in 1999 the ida cohen fine

the planet was discovered by the radial velocity method using the harps apparatus in june 2008 it is the most massive of the six proposed planets in the system the planet is of interest as this star has relatively low metallicity supporting a hypothesis that different metallicities in protostars determine what kind of planets they will form hd 40307 d was discovered through the doppler spectroscopy method which functions by measuring the variations in radial velocity in a star produced by the gravitational effect of orbiting exoplanets the radial velocities were measured by the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher spectrography system harps at the la silla observatory in chile s atacama desert the other less massive planets orbiting hd 40307 were discovered in the same way hd 40307 b and hd 40307 c first and then hd 40307 e hd 40307 f and hd 40307 g the discovery of hd 40307 d and the former two was announced at the astrophysics conference that took place on june 16 18 2008 in nantes france hd 40307 d has a mass of at least 9 2 times earth s assuming that all planets in the system have coplanar orbits it is

philosophically a motif is the cohomology essence of a variety in the formulation of grothendieck for smooth projective varieties a motive is a triple formula 1 where x is a smooth projective variety formula 2 is an idempotent correspondence and m an integer however such a triple contains almost no information outside the context of grothendieck s category of pure motives where a morphism from formula 1 to formula 4 is given by a correspondence of degree formula 5 a more object focussed approach is taken by pierre deligne in le groupe fondamental de la droite projective moins trois points in that article a motive is a system of realisations that is a tuple consisting of modules over the rings respectively various comparison isomorphisms between the obvious base changes of these modules filtrations formula 10 a formula 11 action formula 12 on formula 13 and a frobenius automorphism formula 14 of formula 15 this data is modeled on the cohomologies of a smooth projective formula 16 variety and the structures and compatibilities they admit and gives an idea about what kind of information is contained a motive the theory of motives was originally conjectured as an attempt to unify a

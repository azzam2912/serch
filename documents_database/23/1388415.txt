the strep tag ii is a synthetic peptide consisting of eight amino acids trp ser his pro gln phe glu lys this peptide sequence exhibits intrinsic affinity towards strep tactin a specifically engineered streptavidin and can be n or c terminally fused to recombinant proteins by exploiting the highly specific interaction strep tagged proteins can be isolated in one step from crude cell lysates because the strep tag elutes under gentle physiological conditions it is especially suited for generation of functional proteins streptavidin is a tetrameric protein expressed in streptomyces avidinii because of its high affinity for the vitamin h biotin streptavidin is commonly used in the fields of molecular biology and biotechnology the strep tag was originally selected from a genetic library to specifically bind to a proteolytically truncated core version of streptavidin over the years the strep tag was systemically optimized to permit a greater flexibility in the choice of attachment site further its interaction partner streptavidin was also optimized to increase peptide binding capacity which resulted in the development of strep tactin the binding affinity of strep tag to strep tactin is nearly 100 times higher than to streptavidin the so called strep tag system consisting of

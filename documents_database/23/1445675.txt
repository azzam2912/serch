it is visible to the naked eye as a faint blue white point of light with an apparent visual magnitude of 4 81 the star is moving closer to the earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of 12 km s this object is notable for being a rare nearby example of a young planetary system just entering the last phase of planet formation there is uncertainty about the stellar classification of this star it has the nominal classification of b9 5iiie a b type giant star with emission lines however it has also been classified as an a0 ii iiie star and as a herbig ae be star 51 ophiuchi is about 300 000 years old with 3 3 times the mass of the sun and a polar radius 5 7 times the sun s radius it is radiating three times the sun s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9 772 k the star is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 267 km s close to the critical rotation rate 51 ophiuchi has a disk of dust and gas that appears to be a young debris disk and is probably a planetary system in

additionally flex circuits can be screen printed silver circuits on polyester flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid printed circuit boards allowing the board to conform to a desired shape or to flex during its use an alternative approach to flexible electronics suggests various etching techniques to thin down the traditional silicon substrate to few tens of micrometers to gain reasonable flexibility referred to as flexible silicon 5 mm bending radius flexible printed circuits fpc are made with a photolithographic technology an alternative way of making flexible foil circuits or flexible flat cables ffcs is laminating very thin 0 07 mm copper strips in between two layers of pet these pet layers typically 0 05 mm thick are coated with an adhesive which is thermosetting and will be activated during the lamination process fpcs and ffcs have several advantages in many applications flex circuits are often used as connectors in various applications where flexibility space savings or production constraints limit the serviceability of rigid circuit boards or hand wiring a common application of flex circuits is in computer keyboards most keyboards use flex circuits for the switch matrix in lcd fabrication glass is used as

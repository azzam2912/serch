modern room correction systems produce substantial improvements in the time domain and frequency domain response of the sound reproduction system the use of analog filters such as equalizers to normalize the frequency response of a playback system has a long history however analog filters are very limited in their ability to correct the distortion found in many rooms although digital implementations of the equalizers have been available for some time digital room correction is usually used to refer to the construction of filters which attempt to invert the impulse response of the room and playback system at least in part digital correction systems are able to use acausal filters and are able to operate with optimal time resolution optimal frequency resolution or any desired compromise along the gabor limit digital room correction is a fairly new area of study which has only recently been made possible by the computational power of modern cpus and dsps the configuration of a digital room correction system begins with measuring the impulse response of the room at the listening location for each of the loudspeakers then computer software is used to compute a fir filter which reverses the effects of the room and linear

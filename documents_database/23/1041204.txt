distinctive species have few closely related species and edge species are often the only surviving member of their genus or even higher taxonomic rank the extinction of such species would therefore represent a disproportionate loss of unique evolutionary history biodiversity and potential for future evolution some edge species such as elephants and pandas are well known and already receive considerable conservation attention but many others such as the vaquita the world s rarest cetacean the bumblebee bat arguably the world s smallest mammal and the egg laying long beaked echidnas are highly threatened yet remain poorly understood and are frequently overlooked by existing conservation frameworks recent research indicates that 70 of the world s most threatened and evolutionarily distinct mammal species are currently receiving little or no conservation attention the zoological society of london zsl has launched a global conservation initiative the edge of existence programme to raise awareness and funds for the conservation of these species some species are more distinct than others because they represent a larger amount of unique evolution species like the aardvark have few close relatives and have been evolving independently for many millions of years others like the domestic dog originated only recently and

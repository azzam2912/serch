it contributes to the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex the term brodmann area 9 refers to a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal lobe of the guenon brodmann 1909 regarded it on the whole as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the granular frontal area 9 and frontopolar area 10 in the human distinctive features brodmann 1905 unlike brodmann area 6 brodmann 1909 area 9 has a distinct internal granular layer iv unlike brodmann area 6 or brodmann area 8 brodmann 1909 its internal pyramidal layer v is divisible into two sublayers an outer layer 5a of densely distributed medium size ganglion cells that partially merges with layer iv and an inner clearer cell poor layer 5b the pyramidal cells of sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer iii are smaller and sparser in distribution the external granular layer ii is narrow with small numbers of sparsely distributed granule cells the area is involved in short term memory evaluating recency overriding automatic responses verbal fluency error detection auditory verbal attention inferring the intention of others inferring deduction from spatial imagery inductive reasoning attributing intention sustained attention involved in counting a series of auditory stimuli and displays lower levels of energy consumption

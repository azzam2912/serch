perhaps some of the most known tisanes are actual true teas e g black green white yellow oolong which are prepared from the cured leaves of the tea plant camellia sinensis besides coffee and true teas they are also available decaffeinated most other tisanes do not contain caffeine some feel that the term tisane is more correct than herbal tea or that the latter is even misleading but most dictionaries record that the word tea is also used to refer to other plants beside the tea plant and to beverages made from these other plants in any case the term herbal tea is very well established and much more common than tisane the word tisane was rare in its modern sense before the 20th century when it was borrowed in the modern sense from french this is why some people feel it should be pronounced as in french but the original english pronunciation continues to be more common in us english and especially in uk english the word had already existed in late middle english in the sense of medicinal drink and had already been borrowed from french old french the old french word came from the latin word ptisana

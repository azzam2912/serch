this path starts at one corner and travels along the edges to as many corners as it can reach after it gets to a new corner the previous corner and all of its neighbors must be marked as unusable the path should never travel to a corner after it has been marked unusable in other words a snake is a connected open path in the hypercube where each node in the path with the exception of the head start and the tail finish has exactly two neighbors that are also in the snake the head and the tail each have only one neighbor in the snake the rule for generating a snake is that a node in the hypercube may be visited if it is connected to the current node and it is not a neighbor of any previously visited node in the snake other than the current node in graph theory terminology this is called finding the longest possible induced path in a hypercube it can be viewed as a special case of the induced subgraph isomorphism problem there is a similar problem of finding long induced cycles in hypercubes called the coil in the box problem the snake

the symporter works in the plasma membrane and molecules are transported across the cell membrane at the same time and is therefore a type of cotransporter the transporter is called a symporter because the molecules will travel in the same direction in relation to each other this is in contrast to the antiport transporter typically the ion s will move down the electrochemical gradient allowing the other molecule s to move against the concentration gradient the movement of the ion s across the membrane is facilitated diffusion and is coupled with the active transport of the molecule s sglt1 in the intestinal epithelium transports sodium ions na and glucose across luminal membrane of the epithelial cells so that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream this is the basis of oral rehydration therapy if this symporter did not exist individual sodium channels and glucose uniporters would not be able to transfer glucose against the concentration gradient and into the bloodstream na k 2cl symporter in the loop of henle in the renal tubules of the kidney transports 4 molecules of 3 different types a sodium ion na a potassium ion k and two chloride ions 2cl loop diuretics such as

these genes encode homeodomain protein products that are transcription factors sharing a characteristic protein fold structure that binds dna homeosis is a term coined by william bateson to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part e g antennapedia replacement of the antenna on the head of a fruit fly with legs the homeo prefix in the words homeobox and homeodomain stems from this mutational phenotype which is frequently observed when these genes are mutated in animals homeoboxes were discovered independently in 1983 by michael levine and william mcginnis working in the lab of walter jakob gehring at the university of basel switzerland and by matthew p scott and amy weiner who were then working with thomas kaufman at indiana university in bloomington the existence of homeobox genes were first discovered in drosophila where mutations in homeobox genes caused the radical alterations known as homeotic transformations one of the most famous such mutation is antennapedia in which legs grow from the head of a fly instead of the expected antennae a homeobox is about 180 dna base pairs long and encodes a protein domain that binds dna the following shows the consensus homeodomain 60 amino

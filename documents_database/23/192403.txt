each glomerulus is surrounded by a heterogeneous population of juxtaglomerular neurons that include periglomerular short axon and external tufted cells and glial cells all glomeruli are located near the surface of the olfactory bulb the olfactory bulb also includes a portion of the anterior olfactory nucleus the cells of which contribute fibers to the olfactory tract they are the initial sites for synaptic processing of odor information coming from the nose a glomerulus is made up of a globular tangle of axons from the olfactory receptor neurons and dendrites from the mitral and tufted cells as well as from cells that surround the glomerulus such as the external tufted cells periglomerular cells short axon cells and astrocytes in mammals glomeruli typically range between 50 120 m in diameter and number between 1100 and 2400 depending on the species with roughly between 1100 and 1200 in humans the number of glomeruli in a human decreases with age in humans that are over 80 they are nearly absent each glomerulus is composed of two compartments the olfactory nerve zone and the non olfactory nerve zone the olfactory nerve zone is composed of preterminals and terminals of the olfactory nerve and is where

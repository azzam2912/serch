chain transfer can be either introduced deliberately into a polymerization by use of a chain transfer agent or it may be an unavoidable side reaction with various components of the polymerization chain transfer reactions occur in most forms of addition polymerization including radical polymerization ring opening polymerization coordination polymerization and cationic polymerization as well as anionic polymerization chain transfer reactions are usually categorized by the nature of the molecule that reacts with the growing chain chain transfer was first proposed by taylor and jones in 1930 they were studying the production of polyethylene from ethylene and hydrogen in the presence of ethyl radicals that had been generated by the thermal decomposition of et hg and et pb the observed product mixture could be best explained by postulating transfer of radical character from one reactant to another flory incorporated the radical transfer concept in his mathematical treatment of vinyl polymerization in 1937 he coined the term chain transfer to explain observations that during polymerization average polymer chain lengths were usually lower than predicted by rate considerations alone the first widespread use of chain transfer agents came during world war ii in the us rubber reserve company the mutual recipe for styrene

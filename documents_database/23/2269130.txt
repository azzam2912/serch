as of 2017 booidea contains 61 species including the eponymous neotropical boa constrictor anacondas genus eunectes and smaller tree and rainbow boas corallus epicrates and chilabothrus as well as several genera of booid snakes from various locations around the world candoia from new guinea and melanesia sand boas eryx from northeast africa the middle east and southwestern asia charina and lichanura from north america ungaliophis and exiliboa from central america acrantophis and sanzinia from madagascar and calabaria from tropical west central africa many snake biologists choose to recognize at least calabaria as a member of a separate family calabariidae the taxonomy of boas pythons and other henophidian snakes has long been debated and ultimately the decision whether to assign a particular clade to a particular linnaean rank such as a superfamily family or subfamily is arbitrary the clade name booidea emphasizes the relatively close evolutionary relationship among these 61 species which last shared a common ancestor about 68 ci 49 73 million years ago in contrast to the more distant relationship between booids and their next closest relatives pythonoids and uropeltoids the most recent common ancestor between booids and these other snakes lived 79 ci 65 93 million years ago

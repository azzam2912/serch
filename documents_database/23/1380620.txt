there are numerous unstable oligomers molecules which must be synthesized in situ i e in the reaction mixture but cannot be isolated on their own for use in various processes the in situ polymerization process consists of an initiation step followed by a series of polymerization steps which results in the formation of a hybrid between polymer molecules and nanoparticles nanoparticles are initially spread out in a liquid monomer or a precursor of relatively low molecular weight upon the formation of a homogenous mixture initiation of the polymerization reaction is carried out by addition of an adequate initiator which is exposed to a source of heat radiation etc after the polymerization mechanism is completed a nanocomposite is produced which consists of polymer molecules bound to nanoparticles in order to perform the in situ polymerization of precursor polymer molecules to form a polymer nanocomposite certain conditions must be fulfilled which include the use of low viscosity pre polymers typically less than 1 pascal a short period of polymerization the use of polymer with advantageous mechanical properties and no formation of side products during the polymerization process there are several advantages of the in situ polymerization process which include the use of

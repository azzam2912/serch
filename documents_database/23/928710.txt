semimartingales are good integrators forming the largest class of processes with respect to which the it integral and the stratonovich integral can be defined the class of semimartingales is quite large including for example all continuously differentiable processes brownian motion and poisson processes submartingales and supermartingales together represent a subset of the semimartingales a real valued process x defined on the filtered probability space f f p is called a semimartingale if it can be decomposed as where m is a local martingale and a is a c dl g adapted process of locally bounded variation an r valued process x x x is a semimartingale if each of its components x is a semimartingale first the simple predictable processes are defined to be linear combinations of processes of the form h a 1 for stopping times t and f measurable random variables a the integral h x for any such simple predictable process h and real valued process x is this is extended to all simple predictable processes by the linearity of h x in h a real valued process x is a semimartingale if it is c dl g adapted and for every t 0 is bounded in

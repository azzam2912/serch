it is associated with necrotic fine roots in culture this species shows a uniform dome shaped and cottonwool like colony growth pattern it also frequently presents sympodially branched primary hyphae a high proportion of elongated ellipsoid or ovoid oogonia the absence of amphigynous antheridia its sporangia vary greatly in size and shape its name derives from greek phytophthora plant and destruction and quercina stems from the affected genus quercus phytophthora quercina is a soil borne pathogen and has a polycyclic disease cycle its spores and structures vary in size shape and appearance the pathogen may survive in the soil in unfavorable conditions as chlamydospores that are spherical in shape but they are not produced consistently even when conditions are unfavorable for survival the oogonia are spherical to ovoid in shape and come together with paragynous antheridia to form oospores that are globose during the sexual stage of the disease cycle the pathogen is homothallic and only requires one mating type to form oospores the oospores mycelia or chlamydospores will produce papillae sporangia that may vary in shape including ovoid globuse ampulliform or peanut shaped that dislodge easily from their sporangiophore the sporangia may germinate and infect host tissue or germinate

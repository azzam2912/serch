they are typically found near rotting vegetation and tend to aggregate on rotting bark of trees such as acacia longigolia and other trees in new south wales and southern queensland they demonstrate sexual dimorphism and certain phenotypic characteristics that are dependent on their diet like other flies within neriidae t angusticollis has characteristic dorsocentral bristles located for the most part on their thorax as an identification marker the number of pairs of bristles varies within the genus t angusticollis usually has two pairs instead of one pair variation has been observed on parts other than the thorax certain flies had a lack of bristles or fewer than the average due to genetic factors and environmental factors such as the quality of diet t angusticollis flies demonstrated sexual dimorphism with males often presenting as larger and with more exaggerated traits than females males in particular tend to have elongated heads antennae and legs than their female counterparts the extent of the dimorphism is dependent on genetics as well as parental diet as described below such dimorphism may have developed in males as the exaggerated features are those that males would rely on in male to male combat the flies diet consists

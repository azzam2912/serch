the arm7 core family consists of arm700 arm710 arm7di arm710a arm720t arm740t arm710t arm7tdmi arm7tdmi s arm7ej s the arm7tdmi and arm7tdmi s were the most popular cores of the family since arm7 cores were released from 1993 to 2001 they are no longer recommended for new ic designs instead arm cortex m or arm cortex r cores are preferred this generation introduced the thumb 16 bit instruction set providing improved code density compared to previous designs the most widely used arm7 designs implement the armv4t architecture but some implement armv3 or armv5tej arm7tdmi has 37 registers 31 gpr and 6 spr all these designs use a von neumann architecture thus the few versions containing a cache do not separate data and instruction caches some arm7 cores are obsolete one historically significant model the arm7di is notable for having introduced jtag based on chip debugging the preceding arm6 cores did not support it the d represented a jtag tap for debugging the i denoted an icebreaker debug module supporting hardware breakpoints and watchpoints and letting the system be stalled for debugging subsequent cores included and enhanced this support it is a versatile processor designed for mobile devices and other low

proponents of treethanol claim that its energy yield is higher compared to the energy required for production when compared with more common sources of ethanol i e sugar cane and corn cellulosic ethanol is produced using the lignocellulose biomass that comprises much of the mass of plants essentially at the core of the plant material is cellulose which can be broken down into simple carbohydrate sugars after these sugars have been extracted they can be then be fermented into an alcohol which is known as ethanol the most widely used and promising means of creating cellulosic ethanol is called the cellulolysis process the process consists of hydrolysis on pretreated lignocellulosic materials then enzymes are used to break down cellulose into glucose this glucose is then fermented and distilled the pretreatment step mentioned above is necessary when processing cellulosic ethanol because the glucose sugars are not readily accessible as they are with other ethanol sources such as corn or sugar cane rather the cellulose in wood must be separated from the encapsulating hemicellulose and lignin there are three types of pretreatment physical chemical and biological physical treatment involves physically reducing wood particle size this can be accomplished through chipping grinding etc

the other operations are addition subtraction and multiplication which can be viewed as the inverse of division several symbols are used for the division operator including the obelus the colon and the slash at an elementary level the division of two natural numbers is among other possible interpretations the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one this number of times is not always an integer a number that can be obtained using the other arithmetic operations on the natural numbers which led to two different concepts the division with remainder or euclidean division of two natural numbers provides a quotient which is the number of times the second one is contained in the first one and a remainder which is the part of the first number that remains when in the course of computing the quotient no further full chunk of the size of the second number can be allocated for a modification of this division to yield only one single result the natural numbers must be extended to rational numbers the numbers that can be obtained by using arithmetic on natural numbers or real numbers in these enlarged number systems division is

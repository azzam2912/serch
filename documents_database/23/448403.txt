it consisted of a series of lightly armoured compartments extending laterally along a narrow belt that intersected the ship s waterline in theory this belt would absorb the explosions from torpedoes or any naval artillery shells that struck below the waterline and thus minimize internal damage to the ship itself torpedo belts are also known as side protection systems or sps or torpedo defense system or tds armoured warships dreadnought battleships armoured cruisers and later light and heavy cruisers of the early 20th century carried their main protective armour above the waterline the main belt which was intended to stop flat trajectory gunfire from piercing the hull below the belt the armour generally tapered away to reduce overall weight this however makes a ship vulnerable to hits below the waterline from torpedoes and the occasional large calibre shell extending the belt downwards is impractical since this increases displacement and draft reducing speed and seaworthiness another solution was needed originally torpedo nets were tried these were heavy metal mesh nets hung out on booms at some distance from the sides of ships to catch or detonate torpedoes short of the ship these proved largely ineffective since they could only be deployed

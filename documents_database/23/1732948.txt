cetp collects triglycerides from very low density lipoproteins vldl or low density lipoproteins ldl and exchanges them for cholesteryl esters from high density lipoproteins hdl and vice versa but primarily increasing high density lipoprotein and lowering low density lipoprotein it is thought that modifying lipoprotein levels modifies the risk of cardiovascular disease the first cetp inhibitor torcetrapib was unsuccessful because it increased levels of the hormone aldosterone and increased blood pressure which led to excess cardiac events when it was studied evacetrapib does not have the same effect when studied in a small clinical trial in people with elevated ldl and low hdl significant improvements were noted in their lipid profile evacetrapib evaluation for treatment of high risk vascular disease was discontinued due to lack of efficacy as had already happened in the past with two other cetp inhibitors torcetrapib and dalcetrapib due to increased deaths and little identifiable cardiovascular benefit despite substantial increases in hdl some hypothesize that cetp inhibitors may still be useful in the treatment of dyslipidemia though significant caution is warranted anacetrapib is the fourth cetp inhibitor being tried for cardiovascular benefit in a 2014 study in 165 japanese patients evacetrapib decreased cetp activity alone or

there are known and potential locations near the centre of the country that have been shown to contain hot granites at depth which hold good potential for development of geothermal energy exploratory geothermal wells have been drilled to test for the presence of high temperature geothermal reservoir rocks and such hot granites were detected as a result projects will eventuate in the coming years and more exploration is expected to find new locations there is exploration being conducted in all states and the northern territory but there is no commercial production of geothermal energy in australia exploration involves finding vast blocks of hot rocks with fracture systems that could generate electricity through water being injected circulated through the fractures and being returned to surface as steam which could then be used to rotate steam turbines there are vast deep seated granite systems in central australia that have high temperatures at depth and these are being drilled by companies such as panax geothermal geodynamics ltd petratherm green rock energy and pacific hydro to depths of more than four kilometres south australia has been described as australia s hot rock haven and this renewable energy form could provide an estimated 6 8

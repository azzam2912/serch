it is one of the most massive and most luminous stars known and one of only a handful of stars with the spectral type o2 the star s name hd 269810 comes from the henry draper catalogue the serial number 269810 indicates it was published in the extension of the catalogue and is formally referred to as hde 269810 hd 269810 is classified as an o2iii f star with a temperature of the luminosity class of iii indicates a star somewhat evolved and expanded compared to the zero age main sequence the spectral peculiarity code f indicates strong n emission lines even stronger nn emission and weak hen emission the star s radius is but because of its high surface temperature it is two million times brighter than the sun the high temperature generates a fast stellar wind of shedding over a millionth of the mass of the sun each year in 1995 hd 269810 was estimated to be 190 times the mass of the sun and was thought to be the heaviest star known but the mass is now thought to be around stars as massive as hd 269810 with metallicity typical of the large magellanic cloud will maintain

it states that if g is a group or quasigroup and a and b are elements of g then there exists a unique element x in g such that a x b and a unique element y of g such that y a b the latin square property receives its name from the fact that for a finite group g it is possible in principle to draw a cayley table which gives the element a b in the row corresponding to a and the column corresponding to b the latin square property says that this table will be a latin square a square array in which each possible value for a cell appears precisely once in each row and precisely once in each column further for a countably infinite group g it is possible to imagine an infinite array in which every row and every column corresponds to some element g of g and where the element a b is in the row corresponding to a and the column responding to b in this situation too the latin square property says that each row and each column of the infinite array will contain every possible value precisely once for an

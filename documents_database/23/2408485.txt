the station was first opened in 1875 but has been closed for two periods between then and the 21st century due to a decline in the fishing industry and the ability to supply people to crew the lifeboat it is now host to an inshore lifeboat ilb a lifeboat at runswick just to the south of staithes was established in 1866 with another at staithes nine years later the rnli had wished to station a lifeboat in staithes by 1870 but had given up on the idea as there was a lack of suitable locations to site the lifeboathouse in 1874 a wealthy donation and a codicil in a will of a benefactor that stipulated that a lifeboat should be stationed there enabled the rnli to press ahead with its plans the crew used an old alum warehouse as a temporary lifeboathouse until the official rnli one could be built the lifeboathouse was built at staithes in 1875 and adapted in 1910 and both staithes and lifeboat stations operated side by side but a lack of members and a decline in the fishing fleet at staithes precipitated the closure of staithes in 1922 the station was re opened in 1928

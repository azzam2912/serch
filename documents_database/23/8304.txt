in formulas the group is often abbreviated me such hydrocarbon groups occur in many organic compounds it is a very stable group in most molecules while the methyl group is usually part of a larger molecule it can be found on its own in any of three forms anion cation or radical the anion has eight valence electrons the radical seven and the cation six all three forms are highly reactive and rarely observed the methylium cation ch exists in the gas phase but is otherwise not encountered some compounds are considered to be sources of the ch cation and this simplification is used pervasively in organic chemistry for example protonation of methanol gives a strongly electrophilic methylating reagent similarly methyl iodide and methyl triflate are viewed as the equivalent of the methyl cation because they readily undergo s2 reactions by weak nucleophiles the methanide anion ch exists only in rarefied gas phase or under exotic conditions it can be produced by electrical discharge in ketene at low pressure less than one torr and its enthalpy of reaction is determined to be about 252 2 3 3 kj mol in discussions mechanisms of organic reactions methyl lithium and related grignard

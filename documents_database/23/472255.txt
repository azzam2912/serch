they are the source of the tightly coupled patterns of neural activity that drive rhythmic and stereotyped motor behaviors like walking swimming flying ejaculating urinating defecating breathing or chewing the ability to function without input from higher brain areas still requires modulatory inputs and their outputs are not fixed flexibility in response to sensory input is a fundamental quality of cpg driven behavior to be classified as a rhythmic generator a cpg requires cpgs have been found in practically all vertebrate species investigated including human various molecular genetic and imaging studies have been conducted as for the localization of the cpgs the results have shown that the networks responsible for locomotion are distributed throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord rhythmic movements of the tongue that participate in swallowing mastication and respiration are driven by hypoglossal nuclei which receive inputs from the dorsal medullary reticular column dmrc and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius nts the hypoglossal nucleus receives rhythmic excitatory inputs also from brainstem respiratory neurons within the pre boetzinger complex which appears to play an important role in the origin of respiration rhythmogenesis although anatomical details of cpgs are specifically known in only a

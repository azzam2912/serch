however studies have shown that it can be applied to polymer and composite sheets too generally the sheet is formed by a round tipped tool typically 5 to 20mm in diameter the tool which can be attached to a cnc machine a robot arm or similar indents into the sheet by about 1 mm and follows a contour for the desired part it then indents further and draws the next contour for the part into the sheet and continues to do this until the full part is formed isf can be divided into variants depending on the number of contact points between tool sheet and die in case there is any the term single point incremental forming spif is used when the opposite side of the sheet is supported by a faceplate and two point incremental forming tpif when a full or partial die supports the sheet because the process can be controlled entirely by cnc processes no die is required as is in traditional sheet metal forming the elimination of the die in the manufacturing process reduces the cost per piece and increases turnaround time for low production runs because the need to manufacture a die is eliminated however

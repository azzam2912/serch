they are air sensitive white solids that function as tridentate ligands in coordination and organometallic chemistry bis diphenylphosphinoethyl phenylphosphine is called triphos is a linear tridentate triphosphine it is prepared by the free radical catalysed addition of phenylphosphine to vinyldiphenylphosphine this isomer of triphos is flexible and can bind to an octahedral metal center give either a facial or meridional isomers some derivatives are square planar complexes of the type mx triphos m ni pd pt x halide 1 1 1 tris diphenylphosphinomethyl ethane is also called triphos it is a tripodal ligand three legged of idealized c symmetry it was originally prepared by the reaction of sodium diphenylphosphide and chc chcl it forms complexes with many transition metals usually as a tripodal ligand such complexes are used to analyze mechanistic aspects of homogeneous catalysts for example rhodium forms complexes with chc chpph like triphos rhcl ch triphos rhh ch and triphos rh ch ch provide model intermediates in the catalytic cycle for hydrogenation of alkenes triphos sometimes behaves as a bidentate ligand illustrative cases include fac mn co br triphos and m co triphos where m is cr mo or w triphos serves as a tridentate bridging ligand in

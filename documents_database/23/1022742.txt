small scale working of the site began in the 1830s but was hampered by the remote location and the lack of a transport system to carry the slates to markets the rhosydd slate company was formed in 1853 and became a limited company in 1856 transport was made more difficult by the attitude of the cwmorthin quarry through whose land the most obvious route to the ffestiniog railway ran a solution was found in 1864 with the opening of the croesor tramway to which the quarry was connected by one of the longest single pitch inclines in wales huge amounts of money were spent on development work and the company unable to make adequate returns went into voluntary liquidation in 1873 the quarry was auctioned in 1874 and the new rhosydd slate quarry company ltd was formed unlike its predecessor the directors were all welsh and three quarters of the shareholders were also from the local area the quarry prospered for a while but then profitability declined and in 1900 a large section of the underground workings collapsed the job of opening up new areas was spearheaded by evan jones who nearly succeeded but was hampered by a slump in

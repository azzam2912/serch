o donnell is an american biochemist and a professor at the rockefeller university specializing in the field of dna replication o donnell attended the university of portland receiving his b s in 1975 during his subsequent graduate studies at the university of michigan he became trained as an enzymologist he earned his ph d in biochemistry in 1982 o donnell continued with his postdoctoral training at stanford university under the supervision of nobel laureate arthur kornberg and i robert lehman in the field of nucleic acid enzymology in 1986 o donnell started his own lab at cornell university medical college in 1996 he moved his lab to rockefeller university the goal of his research focuses on elucidating the mechanism of the proteins involved in dna replication his approach involves studying both the biochemical activities of these proteins as well as their physical structures most notably o donnell discovered the first known ring shaped protein that encircles dna for function referred to as a dna sliding clamp the dna clamp tethers the dna polymerase to its dna template thereby allowing the polymerase to efficiently synthesize long genomes without letting go in collaboration with john kuriyan they determined the structures of the

bodo saltans cells have been reported in freshwater and marine environments as well an isolate of bodo saltans is infected by the giant virus bodo saltans virus a member of the mimiviridae bodo saltans is a single celled bean shaped organism 4 to 5 micrometers in length it has two flagella a short anterior projecting flagellum and a longer posterior projecting flagellum without hairs acronematic that extends beyond the length of the cell b saltans secures itself to the substrate of its aquatic habitat by the tip of a posterior flagellum flexing of the posterior flagellum results in a twitching jumping movement that is characteristic of this species this type of movement appears similar to the undulating membrane of the sexually transmitted pathogen trichomonas vaginalis and can result in a false positive diagnosis in cases where b saltans is a contaminant in test samples especially if a nonsterile saline solution has been used phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial rna editing process and inferred protein sequences in b saltans appear to show that b saltans diverged early on from the evolutionary line of kinetoplastids and that this species of bodonid is more closely related to the trypanosomatids than at least two

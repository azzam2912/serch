it is a classical type of organic acidemia the result of this condition is the inability to properly digest specific fats and proteins which in turn leads to a buildup of a toxic level of methylmalonic acid in the blood methylmalonic acidemia stems from several genotypes all forms of the disorder usually diagnosed in the early neonatal period presenting progressive encephalopathy and secondary hyperammonemia the disorder can result in death if undiagnosed or left untreated it is estimated that this disorder has a frequency of 1 in 48 000 births though the high mortality rate in diagnosed cases make exact determination difficult methylmalonic acidemias are found with an equal frequency across ethnic boundaries depending on the affected gene s this disorder may present symptoms that range from mild to life threatening the inherited forms of methylmalonic acidemia cause defects in the metabolic pathway where methylmalonyl coenzyme a coa is converted into succinyl coa by the enzyme methylmalonyl coa mutase vitamin b is also needed for the conversion of methylmalonyl coa to succinyl coa mutations leading to defects in vitamin b metabolism or in its transport frequently result in the development of methylmalonic acidemia this disorder has an autosomal recessive inheritance

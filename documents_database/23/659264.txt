the nature of how this transition occurs is disputed and many studies seek to understand how the order parameter formula 1 changes here formula 2 is the amplitude of the order parameter and formula 3 is the phase most theories involve either the destruction of the amplitude of the order parameter by a reduction in the density of states at the fermi surface or by destruction of the phase coherence which results from the proliferation of vortices in two dimensions the subject of superconductivity becomes very interesting because the existence of true long range order is not possible how then is superconductivity obtained in the 70 s kosterlitz and thouless along with berezinski showed that a different kind of long range order could exist topological order which showed power law correlations meaning that by measuring the two point correlation function formula 4 it decays algebraically this picture changes if disorder is included kosterlitz thouless behavior can be obtained but the fluctuations of the order parameter are greatly enhanced and the transition temperature is suppressed the model to keep in mind in the understanding of how superconductivity occurs in a two dimensional disordered superconductor is the following at high temperatures the

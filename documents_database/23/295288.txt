this is usually accomplished with an attenuated or dead version of a pathogenic bacterium or virus in the vaccine so that the immune system can recognize the antigen later in life many vaccines contain a single antigen that the body will recognize however the antigen of some pathogenic bacteria does not elicit a strong response from the immune system so a vaccination against this weak antigen would not protect the person later in life in this case a conjugate vaccine is used in order to invoke an immune system response against the weak antigen in a conjugate vaccine the weak antigen is covalently attached to a strong antigen thereby eliciting a stronger immunological response to the weak antigen most commonly the weak antigen is a polysaccharide that is attached to strong protein antigen however peptide protein and protein protein conjugates have also been developed the idea of a conjugate vaccine first appeared in experiments involving rabbits in 1927 when the immune response to the streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 polysaccharide antigen was increased by combining the polysaccharide antigen with a protein carrier the first conjugate vaccine used in humans became available in 1987 this was the haemophilus influenzae type b hib

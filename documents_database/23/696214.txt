atmospheric thermodynamics use the laws of classical thermodynamics to describe and explain such phenomena as the properties of moist air the formation of clouds atmospheric convection boundary layer meteorology and vertical instabilities in the atmosphere atmospheric thermodynamic diagrams are used as tools in the forecasting of storm development atmospheric thermodynamics forms a basis for cloud microphysics and convection parameterizations used in numerical weather models and is used in many climate considerations including convective equilibrium climate models the atmosphere is an example of a non equilibrium system atmospheric thermodynamics describes the effect of buoyant forces that cause the rise of less dense warmer air the descent of more dense air and the transformation of water from liquid to vapor evaporation and its condensation those dynamics are modified by the force of the pressure gradient and that motion is modified by the coriolis force the tools used include the law of energy conservation the ideal gas law specific heat capacities the assumption of isentropic processes in which entropy is a constant and moist adiabatic processes during which no energy is transferred as heat most of tropospheric gases are treated as ideal gases and water vapor with its ability to change phase from

an evolutionary fauna typically displays an increase in biodiversity following a logistic curve followed by extinctions although the modern fauna has not yet exhibited the diminishing part of the curve fauna i known as cambrian described as a trilobite rich assemblage encompasses the bulk of the fossils which first appeared in the cambrian explosion and largely became extinct in the ordovician silurian extinction event this fauna comprises trilobites small shelly fossils grouped by sepkoski into polychaeta but including cribricyathids coleolids and volborthellids monoplacophora inarticulate brachiopods and hyoliths fauna ii known as paleozoic described as a brachiopod rich assemblage accounts for most of the fossils appearing in the great ordovician biodiversification event and largely became extinct in the permian triassic extinction event this fauna is marked by fossils of the following classes articulata crinoidea ostracoda cephalopoda anthozoa stenolaemata stelleroidea fauna iii known as modern described as a mollusc rich assemblage arose largely in the mesozoic cenozoic radiation still in progress the following classes are included gastropoda bivalvia osteichthyes malacostraca echinoidea gymnolaemata demospongiae chondrichthyes in the mid 19th century john phillips suggested three great systems palaeozoic mesozoic and caenozoic writing after sepkoski brenchley and harper suggested that there were two early evolutionary

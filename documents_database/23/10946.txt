real time programs must guarantee response within specified time constraints often referred to as deadlines the correctness of these types of systems depends on their temporal aspects as well as their functional aspects real time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds and sometimes microseconds a system not specified as operating in real time cannot usually guarantee a response within any timeframe although typical or expected response times may be given a real time system has been described as one which controls an environment by receiving data processing them and returning the results sufficiently quickly to affect the environment at that time the term real time is also used in simulation to mean that the simulation s clock runs at the same speed as a real clock and in process control and enterprise systems to mean without significant delay real time software may use one or more of the following synchronous programming languages real time operating systems and real time networks each of which provide essential frameworks on which to build a real time software application systems used for many mission critical applications must be real time such as for control of fly by wire aircraft

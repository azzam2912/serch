the technology differs from perimeter based protections such as firewalls that can only detect and block attacks by using network information without contextual awareness rasp technology is said to improve the security of software by monitoring its inputs and blocking those that could allow attacks while protecting the runtime environment from unwanted changes and tampering rasp protected applications rely less on external devices like firewalls to provide runtime security protection when a threat is detected rasp can prevent exploitation and possibly take other actions including terminating a user s session shutting the application down alerting security personnel and sending a warning to the user rasp aims to close the gap left by application security testing and network perimeter controls neither of which have enough insight into real time data and event flows to either prevent vulnerabilities slipping through the review process or block new threats that were unforeseen during development rasp can be integrated as a framework or module that runs in conjunction with a program s codes libraries and system calls the technology can also be implemented as a virtualization in some application security solutions rasp technology is used in conjunction with dynamic application security testing dast technology to

it is located in the german town of m lheim the mpi cec investigates fundamental chemical processes in energy transformation and contributes to the development of new and efficient catalysts its approach to this problem is based on a profound understanding of the underlying chemical reactions and multidisciplinary director serena debeer the department of inorganic spectroscopy focuses on the development and application of advanced x ray spectroscopic tools for understanding processes in biological and chemical catalysis director the research of the molecular catalysis department focuses on the development of technologies for the conversion of renewable energy and feedstocks to sustainable fuels and chemical products director the department heterogeneous reactions is researching among other things on a better understanding of the processes of electrocatalytic water splitting the aim is to generate generic insight and solutions for synthesis and analysis of chemical energy conversion systems as one of 84 institutes in the max planck society it was first part of the neighboring max planck institute for coal research and became independent in 1981 under the name of max planck institute for radiation chemistry it was renamed to max planck institute for bioinorganic chemistry in 2003 to reflect its changing research focus following

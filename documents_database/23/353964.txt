as channels they allow cerebrospinal fluid csf produced in the lateral ventricles to reach the third ventricle and then the rest of the brain s ventricular system the walls of the interventricular foramina also contain choroid plexus a specialized csf producing structure that is continuous with that of the lateral and third ventricles above and below it the interventricular foramina are two holes pl foramina that connect the left and the right lateral ventricles to the third ventricle they are located on the underside near the midline of the lateral ventricles and join the third ventricle where its roof meets its anterior surface in front of the foramen is the fornix and behind is the thalamus the foramen is normally crescent shaped but rounds and increases in size depending on the size of the lateral ventricles the development and shape of the ventricular system relates to the differential development of different parts of the brain with the ventricular system ultimately arising from the neural tube the lateral ventricles remain connected to the third ventricle throughout development themselves developing as outpouchings from the third ventricle the foramina develop slowly in a forward and outward direction as the fornix grows in size

the colonies of the colonial species can be large and in some cases the specialized individual animals cannot survive outside the colony a few genera within this class live in fresh water hydrozoans are related to jellyfish and corals and belong to the phylum cnidaria some examples of hydrozoans are the freshwater jelly craspedacusta sowerbyi freshwater polyps hydra obelia portuguese man o war physalia physalis chondrophores porpitidae air fern sertularia argentea and pink hearted hydroids tubularia most hydrozoan species include both a polypoid and a medusoid stage in their lifecycles although a number of them have only one or the other for example hydra has no medusoid stage while liriope lacks the hydroid stage the hydroid form is usually colonial with multiple polyps connected by tubelike hydrocauli the hollow cavity in the middle of the polyp extends into the associated hydrocaulus so that all the individuals of the colony are intimately connected where the hydrocaulus runs along the substrate it form a horizontal root like stolon that anchors the colony to the bottom the colonies are generally small no more than a few centimeters across but some in siphonophorae can reach sizes of several meters they may have a tree

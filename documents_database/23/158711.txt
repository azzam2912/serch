a song is said to be through composed if it has different music for each stanza of the lyrics this is in contrast to strophic form in which each stanza is set to the same music sometimes the german durchkomponiert is used to indicate the same concept musicologist james webster says of the term many examples of this form can be found in schubert s lieder where the words of a poem are set to music and each line is different for example in his lied der erlk nig the elf king in which the setting proceeds to a different musical arrangement for each new stanza and whenever the piece comes to each character the character portrays its own voice register and tonality another example is haydn s farewell symphony no section of ary barroso s 1939 samba brazil repeats however a second set of lyrics in english allows the melody to be sung through twice the term through composed is also applied to opera and musical theater to indicate a work that consists of an uninterrupted stream of music from beginning to end as in the operas of monteverdi and wagner as opposed to having a collection of songs

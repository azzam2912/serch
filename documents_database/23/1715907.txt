the circular polarization is left formula 1 or right formula 2 depending on the field rotation direction and according to the convention used either from the point of view of the source or the receiver both conventions are used in science depending on the context when a light beam is circularly polarized each of its photons carries a spin angular momentum sam of formula 3 where formula 4 is the reduced planck constant and the formula 5 sign is positive for left and negative for right circular polarizations this is adopting the convention from the point of view of the receiver most commonly used in optics this sam is directed along the beam axis parallel if positive antiparallel if negative the above figure shows the instantaneous structure of the electric field of left formula 1 and right formula 2 circularly polarized light in space the green arrows indicate the propagation direction the mathematical expressions reported under the figures give the three electric field components of circularly polarized plane wave propagating in the formula 8 direction in complex notation general expression for the spin angular momentum in the paraxial limit is where formula 10 and formula 11 are the electric field

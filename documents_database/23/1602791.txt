its main focus is on the modeling of dynamic interaction networks of various sizes the goal of the library is to provide a way to represent graphs and work on it to this end graphstream proposes several graph classes that allow to model directed and undirected graphs 1 graphs or p graphs a k a multigraphs that are graphs that can have several edges between two nodes graphstream allows to store any kind of data attribute on the graph elements numbers strings or any object moreover in addition graphstream provides a way to handle the graph evolution in time this means handling the way nodes and edges are added and removed and the way data attributes may appear disappear and evolve dynamics of graphs is modeled as stream of graph events these events can be about the structure of the graph add and remove elements or about the attributes of elements graph node and edge attributes this is the list of events which can be found in graphstream a stream is the connection between a source providing events and a sink sources can be anything able to produce events for example a source reading a file an algorithm generating a

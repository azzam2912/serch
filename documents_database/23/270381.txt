the mission of the project is to build a high performance and highly available server for linux using clustering technology which provides good scalability reliability and serviceability the major work of the lvs project is now to develop advanced ip load balancing software ipvs application level load balancing software ktcpvs and cluster management components lvs can be used for building highly scalable and highly available network services such as web email media and voip services and integrating scalable network services into large scale reliable e commerce or e government applications lvs based solutions already have been deployed in many real applications throughout the world including wikipedia the lvs components depend upon the linux netfilter framework and its source code is available in the codice 1 subdirectory within the linux kernel source lvs is able to handle udp tcp layer 4 protocols as well as ftp passive connection by inspecting layer 7 packets it provides a hierarchy of counters in the codice 2 directory the userland utility program used to configure lvs is called ipvsadm which requires superuser privileges to run lvs implements several balancing schedulers listed below with the relevant source files commonly used terms include the following setting up

in roll bonding two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers the pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the clad material the mating surfaces must be previously prepared scratched cleaned degreased in order to increase their friction coefficient and remove any oxide layers the process can be performed at room temperature or at warm conditions in warm roll bonding heat is applied to pre heat the sheets just before rolling in order to increase their ductility and improve the strength of the weld the strength of the rolled bonds depends on the main process parameters including the rolling conditions entry temperature of the sheets amount of thickness reduction rolling speed etc the pre rolling treatment conditions annealing temperature and time surface preparation techniques etc and the post rolling heat treatments the applications of roll bonding can be used for cladding of metal sheets or as a sub step of the accumulative roll bonding bonding of the sheets can be controlled by painting a pattern on one sheet only the bare metal surfaces bond and the un bonded portion

the furazan ring system is also found in the steroid furazabol furazan and its derivatives are obtained from the oxime derivatives of 1 2 diketones in theory the simplest means of producing furazan is the cyclic dehydration of glyoxime the di oxime of glyoxal however the instability of furazan to high temperature or extremes of ph requires that this process be performed carefully the formation of furazan from glyoxime is also exothermic and takes place with the copious evolution of noxious gases the reaction may be achieved by heating glyoxime to 150 c in the presence of succinic anhydride furazan will evaporate at this temperature and thus is continuously removed from the reaction mixture 3 4 dimethylfurazan b p 154 159 c is prepared by an analogous process by dehydrating dimethylglyoxime a variety of related derivatives are known including diphenyl and methylethylfurazan potassium permanganate oxidizes 3 4 dimethylfurazan first to methylfurazancarboxylic acid and then to furazandicarboxylic acid by warming oxyfurazan acetic acid with excess of potassium permanganate oxyfurazancarboxylic acid is obtained it crystallizes as prisms m p 175 c furazancarboxylic acid m p 107 c is prepared by oxidation of furazanpropionic acid with potassium permanganate it dissolves in base to

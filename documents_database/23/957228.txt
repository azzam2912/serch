this includes a range of alternatives to cells made of semiconducting p n junctions first generation and thin film cells second generation common third generation systems include multi layer tandem cells made of amorphous silicon or gallium arsenide while more theoretical developments include frequency conversion i e changing the frequencies of light that the cell cannot use to light frequencies that the cell can use thus producing more power hot carrier effects and other multiple carrier ejection techniques emerging photovoltaics include the achievements in the research of perovskite cells especially have received tremendous attention in the public as their research efficiencies recently soared above 20 percent they also offer a wide spectrum of low cost applications in addition another emerging technology concentrator photovoltaics cpv uses high efficient multi junction solar cells in combination with optical lenses and a tracking system solar cells can be thought of as visible light counterparts to radio receivers a receiver consists of three basic parts an antenna that converts the radio waves light into wave like motions of electrons in the antenna material an electronic valve that traps the electrons as they pop off the end of the antenna and a tuner that amplifies electrons

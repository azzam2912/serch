the fiber of f e over a point x is the set of all ordered bases or frames for e the general linear group acts naturally on f e via a change of basis giving the frame bundle the structure of a principal gl k r bundle where k is the rank of e the frame bundle of a smooth manifold is the one associated to its tangent bundle for this reason it is sometimes called the tangent frame bundle let e x be a real vector bundle of rank k over a topological space x a frame at a point x x is an ordered basis for the vector space e equivalently a frame can be viewed as a linear isomorphism the set of all frames at x denoted f has a natural right action by the general linear group gl k r of invertible k k matrices a group element g gl k r acts on the frame p via composition to give a new frame this action of gl k r on f is both free and transitive this follows from the standard linear algebra result that there is a unique invertible linear transformation sending one basis

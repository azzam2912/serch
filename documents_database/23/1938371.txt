ice m lange is commonly the result of an ice calving event where ice breaks off the edge of a glacier ice m lange affects many of the earth s processes including glacier calving ocean wave generation and frequency generation of seismic waves atmosphere and ocean interactions and tidewater glacier systems ice m lange is possibly the largest granular material on earth and is quasi 2 dimensional m lange or melange means mixture and originates from the old french word meslance ice m lange has also been referred to as sikkussaq or sikkusak which is a greenlandic word meaning packed by ice or surrounded by sea ice the word is derived from the word siku which means sea ice fjord seiches are created by the calving and capsize of large icebergs and m lange movement it has been shown that such events create long period large scale surface gravity waves and seiches the presence of ice m lange slows down the propagation of both external and internal seiches and introduces band gaps where energy propagation group velocity vanishes if energy is introduced into the fjord within the period range covered by a band gap it will remain trapped as a

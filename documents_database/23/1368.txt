the ability of a player both to get on base and to hit for power two important offensive skills are represented an ops of 900 or higher in major league baseball puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters typically the league leader in ops will score near and sometimes above the 1 000 mark the basic equation is formula 1 where obp is on base percentage and slg is slugging average these averages are defined formula 2 the numerator h bb hbp effectively means number of trips to first base at least the denominator ab bb sf hbp effectively means total plate appearances still doesn t include sacrifice bunts this is because though a batter makes a trip to the plate he is not given an ab when he walks bb or hbp or when he hits the ball into play and is called out but the action allows a run to score as in the sf scenario as a result the 4 counts ab bb sf hbp are needed to calculate a batter s total trips to the plate and formula 3 where in one equation ops can be represented as formula 4 on base plus slugging

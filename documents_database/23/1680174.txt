it is one of the most widely distributed ferns of the wet old world tropics and adjacent regions including polynesia and the pacific in parts of the new world tropics its niche is filled by its relative dicranopteris pectinatus this rhizomatous fern spreads via cloning spreading along the ground and climbing on other vegetation often forming thickets 3 metres deep or more the stem grows from the rhizome branches at a 45 angle and forms fronds that continue to bud and branch in this way the growth can continue for a long distance as the plant forms a mat grows over itself in layers and spreads when climbing the leafy branches can reach over 6 metres long and can climb 10 high when supported by a tree the ultimate segments of the leaves are linear in shape up to 7 centimeters long by a few millimeters wide the undersides are hairy and sometimes waxy it can also reproduce via spores the fern grows easily on poorly drained nutrient poor soils and in disturbed habitats and steep slopes it does not tolerate shade so once established it will eventually be shaded out by taller vegetation unless it climbs above it it

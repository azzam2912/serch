it can be visualized as a sausage of fixed radius whose centerline is brownian motion the wiener sausage was named after norbert wiener by because of its relation to the wiener process the name is also a pun on vienna sausage as wiener is german for viennese the wiener sausage is one of the simplest non markovian functionals of brownian motion its applications include stochastic phenomena including heat conduction it was first described by and it was used by to explain results of a bose einstein condensate with proofs published by the wiener sausage w t of radius and length t is the set valued random variable on brownian paths b in some euclidean space defined by there has been a lot of work on the behavior of the volume lebesgue measure w t of the wiener sausage as it becomes thin 0 by rescaling this is essentially equivalent to studying the volume as the sausage becomes long t in dimension d at least 3 the volume of the wiener sausage is asymptotic to as t tends to infinity in dimensions 1 and 2 this formula gets replaced by formula 4 and formula 5 respectively a student of spitzer proved

this angle varies at different points on the earth s surface positive values of inclination indicate that the magnetic field of the earth is pointing downward into the earth at the point of measurement and negative values indicate that it is pointing upward the dip angle is in principle the angle made by the needle of a vertically held compass though in practice ordinary compass needles may be weighted against dip or may be unable to move freely in the correct plane the value can be measured more reliably with a special instrument typically known as a dip circle dip angle was discovered by the engineer georg hartmann in 1544 a method of measuring it with a dip circle was described by robert norman in england in 1581 magnetic dip results from the tendency of a magnet to align itself with lines of magnetic field as the earth s magnetic field lines are not parallel to the surface the north end of a compass needle will point downward in the northern hemisphere positive dip or upward in the southern hemisphere negative dip the range of dip is from 90 degrees at the north magnetic pole to 90 degrees at the

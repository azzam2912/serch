the name plastic crystal refers to the mechanical softness of such phases they resemble waxes and are easily deformed if the internal degree of freedom is molecular rotation the name rotor phase or rotatory phase is also used typical examples are the modifications methane i and ethane i in addition to the conventional molecular plastic crystals there are also emerging ionic plastic crystals particularly organic ionic plastic crystals oipcs and protic organic ionic plastic crystals poipcs poipcs are solid protic organic salts formed by proton transfer from a br nsted acid to a br nsted base and in essence are protic ionic liquids in the molten state have found to be promising solid state proton conductors for high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells examples include 1 2 4 triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate and imidazolium methanesulfonate if the internal degree of freedom freezes in a disordered way an orientational glass is obtained the orientational degree of freedom may be an almost free rotation or it may be a jump diffusion between a restricted number of possible orientations as was shown for carbon tetrabromide x ray diffraction patterns of plastic crystals are characterized by strong diffuse intensity in addition to the sharp bragg

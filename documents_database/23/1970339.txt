that is a proof formula 1 of formula 2 is considered redundant if there exists another proof formula 3 of formula 4 such that formula 5 i e formula 6 and formula 7 where formula 8 is the number of nodes in formula 9 a proof containing a subproof of the shapes here omitted pivots indicate that the resolvents must be uniquely defined is locally redundant indeed both of these subproofs can be equivalently replaced by the shorter subproof formula 11 in the case of local redundancy the pairs of redundant inferences having the same pivot occur close to each other in the proof however redundant inferences can also occur far apart in the proof the following definition generalizes local redundancy by considering inferences with the same pivot that occur within different contexts we write formula 12 to denote a proof context formula 13 with a single placeholder replaced by the subproof formula 14 a proof is potentially globally redundant furthermore it is globally redundant if it can be rewritten to one of the following shorter proofs the proof is locally redundant as it is an instance of the first pattern in the definition formula 18 but it is not

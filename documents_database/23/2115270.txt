fusion3 3d printers use fused deposition modeling to create three dimensional solid or hollow objects from a digital model which can be designed or produced from a scan fusion3 was started by north carolina state university alumnus katelyn padgett who after building several kit 3d printers developed a proprietary linear motion process to improve upon the existing open source 3d printer designs the company began production in 2014 without any external investment the company received a 25 000 grant from the innovation fund of north carolina in 2014 to invest into patent activities and for marketing purposes fusion3 debuted the f410 an update to the f400 in april 2018 the f410 maintained all the class leading capabilities of the f400 with a number of new features including swappable print heads of different sizes 4 6 and 8mm filament detection that pauses the f410 if you run out of material or encounter a print jam during a print and a new conductive automatic bed leveling system in april 2016 fusion3 introduced the f400 available as either a single extruder f400 s or what it calls the high flow rate f400 hfr the f400 is based the same core xy framework f

temperature or set of conditions to achieve a log reduction that is to kill 90 or 1 log of relevant microorganisms a d value is denoted with the capital letter d thus after an exposure time of 1 d only 10 of the organisms originally present in a microbial colony would remain the term originated in assessments of microbes thermal resistance and in thermal death time analysis however it now has analogous uses in other microbial resistance and death rate applications such as for ethylene oxide and radiation processing use of d values is based on the assumption that the procedure in question causes the number of living microorganisms to decay exponentially from this perspective d values can be understood as roughly analogous to half lives of radioactive substances however a half life involves a reduction of 50 rather than 90 the half life is actually roughly 30 of the d value so if d 10 minutes the number of living microorganisms will be halved in about 3 minutes generally each lot of a sterilization resistant organism will have its own specific d value determining a d value requires an experiment but only gives the d value under the specific

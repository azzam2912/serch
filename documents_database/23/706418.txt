this division is performed by a chain of a number of different intracellular enzymes a system generally referred to as tryptophanase indole is generated by reductive deamination from tryptophan via the intermediate molecule indolepyruvic acid tryptophanase catalyzes the deamination reaction during which the amine nh group of the tryptophan molecule is removed final products of the reaction are indole pyruvic acid ammonium nh and energy pyridoxal phosphate is required as a coenzyme like many biochemical tests on bacteria results of an indole test are indicated by a change in color following a reaction with an added reagent pure bacterial culture must be grown in sterile tryptophan or peptone broth for 24 48 hours before performing the test following incubation five drops of kovac s reagent isoamyl alcohol para dimethylaminobenzaldehyde concentrated hydrochloric acid are added to the culture broth a positive result is shown by the presence of a red or red violet color in the surface alcohol layer of the broth a negative result appears yellow a variable result can also occur showing an orange color as a result this is due to the presence of skatole also known as methyl indole or methylated indole another possible product of tryptophan

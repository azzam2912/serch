this title is disputed as there is no standard definition of a village as distinct from a town and largest can refer to population or area a typical contender is lancing in west sussex with a population of around 19 000 whilst lancing might be described as a town in everyday use it has not formally taken on this status and in this case with three tiers of local government it has a parish council rather than a town council also it has a village hall instead of a town hall all claimants must avoid having had a town charter or licence to hold a market from the crown many other villages are in a similar position some of the claimants below such as cottingham lancing and rawmarsh are part of larger urban areas and it can be contended that such claimants are suburbs or suburban villages rather than standalone villages which have a clear surrounding open space buffer zone the old simple definitions of towns were settlements with these two features have been long surpassed by large new towns on former villages such as harlow which have neither feature yet have virtually no claims that they are villages the

in this way new analogs are already controlled before they are even created a large number of cannabinoids have been grouped into classes based on similarities in their chemical structure and these classes have been widely adopted across a variety of jurisdictions typical groups of compounds included for control may include naphthoylindoles phenylacetylindoles benzoylindoles cyclohexylphenols naphthylmethylindoles naphthoylpyrroles naphthylmethylindenes indole 3 carboxamides indole 3 carboxylates indazole 3 carboxamides and sometimes others each with specific substitutions on specific atoms of the molecule the scope of definitions and the range of compounds included may vary substantially between jurisdictions so compounds which are legal in one country or state may be illegal in another for example in many jurisdictions there is a general control on naphthoylindoles any compound containing a 3 1 naphthoyl indole structure with substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring by an alkyl haloalkyl alkenyl cycloalkylmethyl cycloalkylethyl 1 n methyl 2 piperidinyl methyl or 2 4 morpholinyl ethyl group whether or not further substituted in the indole ring to any extent and whether or not substituted in the naphthyl ring to any extent example definition from kentucky which is substantially derived from the 2009 acmd advice on synthetic cannabinoids

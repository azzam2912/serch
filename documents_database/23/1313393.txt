three distinct intervals may be termed neutral sixths these intervals are all within about 12 cents of each other and are difficult for most people to distinguish neutral sixths are roughly a quarter tone sharp from 12 equal temperament 12 et minor sixths and a quarter tone flat from 12 et major sixths in just intonation as well as in tunings such as 31 et 41 et or 72 et which more closely approximate just intonation the intervals are closer together a neutral sixth can be formed by subtracting a neutral second from a minor seventh based on its positioning in the harmonic series the undecimal neutral sixth implies a root one minor seventh above the higher of the two notes the pitch ratio 13 8 840 53 cents is the ratio of the thirteenth harmonic is notated in ben johnston s system as a in 24 et is approximated by a this note is often corrected to a just or pythagorean ratio on the natural horn but the pure thirteenth harmonic was used in pieces including britten s serenade for tenor horn and strings

by contrast the original choice of gauge group in the physics of electromagnetism had been u 1 which is commutative for a non abelian lie group g its elements do not commute i e they in general do not satisfy the quaternions marked the introduction of non abelian structures in mathematics in particular its generators formula 2 which form a basis for the vector space of infinitesimal transformations the lie algebra have a commutation rule the structure constants formula 4 quantify the lack of commutativity and do not vanish we can deduce that the structure constants are antisymmetric in the first two indices and real the normalization is usually chosen using the kronecker delta as within this orthonormal basis the structure constants are then antisymmetric with respect to all three indices an element formula 6 of the group can be expressed near the identity element in the form where formula 8 are the parameters of the transformation let formula 9 be a field that transforms covariantly in a given representation formula 10 this means that under a transformation we get since any representation of a compact group is equivalent to a unitary representation we take to be a unitary matrix

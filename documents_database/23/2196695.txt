the amplifier is known across the audiophile community for its high output power and low total harmonic distortion thd the au 11000 has an output power of 110 watts per channel and was one of the earliest home audio amplifiers to use multiple transistors per channel using a push pull method to add more amplification power the au 11000 uses independent circuitry in the amplification process in such a way that each individual channel has its own circuits this means everything from the power supply to the bias control board all have 2 identical and independent circuits per channel to separate the 2 stereo channels this also minimizes the total harmonic distortion thd within the amplifier down to 0 08 the au 11000 has its own power protection built into the amplifier when the power switch is turned to the on position the power light comes on as green for a second and turns red for a few seconds until the power protection circuitry has confirmed it is safe to power up once it has finished the power light turns and remains green until the amplifier is turned off the au 11000 also has its own block diagram printed on

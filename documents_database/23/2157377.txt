it is a generalization of classical euler bernoulli beam theory that approximates a beam as an assembly of thin walled plates that are constrained to deform as a linear combination of specified deformation modes its origin is due to richard schardt 1966 since then many other authors have extended the initial first order elastic gbt formulations developed by schardt and his co workers many extensions and applications of gbt have been developed by camotim instituto superior t cnico university of lisbon portugal and collaborators since the beginning of the 21st century the theory can be applied without restrictions to any prismatic thin walled structural member exhibiting straight or curved axial axis any loading any cross section geometry any boundary conditions gbt is in some ways analogous to the finite strip method and can be a more computationally efficient method than modeling a beam with a full 2d or 3d finite element method to predict the member structural behavior gbt has been widely recognized as an efficient approach to analyzing thin walled members and structural systems the efficiency arises mostly from its modal nature the displacement field is expressed as a linear combination of cross section deformation modes whose amplitudes vary

she is interested in developing more sustainable holistic approaches for infectious disease control and conservation of microbiomes brinkman received her b sc in biochemistry from the university of waterloo in 1990 and earned her ph d under the supervision of dr jo anne dillon at the university of ottawa in 1996 she completed two post doctorate fellowships at the university of british columbia under the guidance of drs robert bob hancock and ann rose though originally trained as a microbiologist she developed an interest in bioinformatics throughout her graduate and postdoctoral studies combining the fields when she started her own group focused on pathogen microbial bioinformatics at simon fraser university in 2001 brinkman s current research interests center around improving understanding of how microbes evolve and improving computational methods that aid the analysis of microbes and the development of new vaccines drugs and diagnostics for infectious diseases increasingly her methods have been applied for more environmental applications she is noted for developing psortb the most precise method available for computational protein subcellular localization prediction and the first computational method that exceeded the accuracy of some common high throughput laboratory methods for such subcellular localization analysis this method aids the prediction

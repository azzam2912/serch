the inequality is named after william henry young and should not be confused with young s convolution inequality young s inequality for products can be used to prove h lder s inequality it is also widely used to estimate the norm of nonlinear terms in pde theory since it allows one to estimate a product of two terms by a sum of the same terms raised to a power and scaled in its standard form the inequality states that if a and b are nonnegative real numbers and p and q are real numbers greater than 1 such that 1 p 1 q 1 then the equality holds if and only if this form of young s inequality can be proved by jensen s inequality and can be used to prove h lder s inequality equivalently it could be written as it is just the concavity of the logarithm function the equality holds if and only if formula 3 generally the equality holds if and only if formula 5 is a constant an elementary case of young s inequality is the inequality with exponent 2 which also gives rise to the so called young s inequality with valid for every

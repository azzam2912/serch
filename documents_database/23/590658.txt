instruments featuring polyphony are said to be polyphonic instruments that are not capable of polyphony are monophonic or paraphonic a monophonic synthesizer or monosynth is a synthesizer that produces only one note at a time making it smaller and cheaper than a polyphonic synthesizer which can play multiple notes at once this does not necessarily refer to a synthesizer with a single oscillator the minimoog for example has three oscillators which are settable in arbitrary intervals but it can play only one note at a time well known monosynths include the minimoog the roland tb 303 and the korg prophecy duophonic synthesizers such as the arp odyssey and formanta polivoks built in the 1970s and 1980s respectively have a capability to independently play two pitches at a time these synthesizers have at least two oscillators that are separately controllable and a duophonic keyboard that can generate two control voltage signals for the lowest and highest note when two or more keys are pressed simultaneously the lowest and highest note will be heard when only one key is pressed both oscillators are assigned to one note possibly with a more complex sound the earliest polyphonic synthesizers were built in the late

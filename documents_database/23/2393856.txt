crypto agility facilitates system upgrades and evolution crypto agility can act as a safety measure or an incident response mechanism when the encryption algorithms of a system are discovered to be vulnerable a security system is considered crypto agile if its encryption algorithms can be replaced with ease and is at least partly automated the retirement of the x 509 public key certificate illustrates crypto agility a public key certificate has cryptographic parameters including key type key length and a hash algorithm x 509 version v 3 with key type rsa a 1024 bit key length and the sha 1 hash algorithm were found by nist to have a key length that made it vulnerable to attacks thus prompting the transition to sha 2 cryptographic techniques are widely incorporated to protect applications and business transactions since the 2010s public key infrastructure pki has been progressively integrated into business applications via public key certificates which were used as trust foundations between network entities pki has better security features than traditional access control mechanisms which incorporate cryptographic technologies such as digital certificates and signatures public key certificates acting as digital credentials are the core component for strong authentication and secure communication between

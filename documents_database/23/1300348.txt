it is the cetyl ester of myristoleic acid there are some clinical trials appearing to show benefit for inflammation due to arthritis which should be taken into account cetyl myristoleate has been prepared by an esterification reaction between myristoleic acid and cetyl alcohol catalyzed by p toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in animal studies cetyl myristoleate was first reported to block inflammation and prevent adjuvant induced arthritis at very high doses in rats other studies using identical and similar methods have failed to replicate this effect in follow up studies in mice a modest anti inflammatory effect was observed although cetyl myristoleate is sold as a dietary supplement its possible benefits in the treatment of any medical condition are largely unknown and the federal trade commission has taken legal action against supplement manufacturers for exaggerated claims there is some clinical evidence for the benefits of cfas which may contain cetyl myristoleate in arthritic patients one pilot study found that cetyl myristoleate may be beneficial against fibromyalgia however these low quality clinical trials provide only limited scientific evidence of efficacy but see also cetyl myristoleate com clinical studies

heavy construction vehicles are a common example in this type of machine hydraulic fluid is pumped to various hydraulic motors and hydraulic cylinders throughout the machine and becomes pressurised according to the resistance present the fluid is controlled directly or automatically by control valves and distributed through hoses tubes and or pipes hydraulic systems like pneumatic systems are based on pascal s law which states that any pressure applied to a fluid inside a closed system will transmit that pressure equally everywhere and in all directions a hydraulic system uses an incompressible liquid as its fluid rather than a compressible gas the popularity of hydraulic machinery is due to the very large amount of power that can be transferred through small tubes and flexible hoses and the high power density and wide array of actuators that can make use of this power and the huge multiplication of forces that can be achieved by applying pressures over relatively large areas one drawback compared to machines using gears and shafts is that any transmission of power results in some losses due to resistance of fluid flow through the piping joseph bramah patented the hydraulic press in 1795 while working at bramah s

cxcr4 is one of several chemokine receptors that hiv can use to infect cd4 t cells hiv isolates that use cxcr4 are traditionally known as t cell tropic isolates typically these viruses are found late in infection it is unclear as to whether the emergence of cxcr4 using hiv is a consequence or a cause of immunodeficiency cxcr4 is upregulated during the implantation window in natural and hormone replacement therapy cycles in the endometrium producing in presence of a human blastocyst a surface polarization of the cxcr4 receptors suggesting that this receptor is implicated in the adhesion phase of human implantation cxcr4 s ligand sdf 1 is known to be important in hematopoietic stem cell homing to the bone marrow and in hematopoietic stem cell quiescence it has been also shown that cxcr4 signalling regulates the expression of cd20 on b cells until recently sdf 1 and cxcr4 were believed to be a relatively monogamous ligand receptor pair other chemokines are promiscuous tending to use several different chemokine receptors recent evidence demonstrates ubiquitin is also a natural ligand of cxcr4 ubiquitin is a small 76 amino acid protein highly conserved among eukaryotic cells it is best known for its intracellular

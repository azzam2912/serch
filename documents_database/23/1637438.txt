most are anions cyanide is a highly basic and small ligand hence it readily saturates the coordination sphere of metal ions the resulting cyanometallate anions are often used as ligands for building more complex structures called coordination polymers the best known example of which is prussian blue a common dyestuff homoleptic cyanometallates refers to complexes where the only ligand is cyanide for the first row transition metals well known homoleptic cyanometallates are the hexacyanides hexacyanometalates are known for ti iii v iii cr iii mn iii fe ii fe iii and co iii other more labile derivatives are known as well the mn iii fe ii fe iii and co iii derivatives are low spin reflecting the strong binding of cyanide i e cyanide ranks highly in the spectrochemical series several tetracyanometalates are also known the best known being those of the d metals ni ii pd ii and pt ii these species are square planar and diamagnetic the coinage metals form stable dicyanometallates cu cn ag cn and au cn for heavier metals other stoichiometries are known such as kmo cn some cyanometallates are clusters featuring metal metal bonds such as mo cn mixed ligand cyanometallates have been prepared

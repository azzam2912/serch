for example if we have a prime factorization of formula 7 of the form formula 8 for distinct primes formula 9 formula 10 then the respective prime omega functions are given by formula 11 and formula 12 these prime factor counting functions have many important number theoretic relations the function formula 1 is additive and formula 2 is completely additive formula 15 if formula 16 divides formula 7 at least once we count it only once e g formula 18 formula 19 if formula 16 divides formula 7 formula 22 times then we count the exponents e g formula 23 formula 24 if formula 25 then formula 7 is squarefree and related to the m bius function by if formula 28 then formula 7 is a prime number it is known that the average order of the divisor function satisfies formula 30 like many arithmetic functions there is no explicit formula for formula 2 or formula 32 but there are approximations an asymptotic series for the average order of formula 1 is given by where formula 35 is the mertens constant and formula 36 are the stieltjes constants the function formula 1 is related to divisor sums over the m

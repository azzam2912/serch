he is the director of the human neuroimaging lab and computational psychiatry unit at the fralin biomedical research institute at vtc in roanoke virginia where he also holds the title of the inaugural virginia tech carilion vernon mountcastle research professor montague is also a professor in the department of physics at virginia tech in blacksburg virginia and professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at virginia tech carilion school of medicine montague s work has long focused on computational neuroscience the connection between physical mechanisms present in real neural tissue and the computational functions that these mechanisms embody his early theoretical work focused on the hypothesis that dopaminergic systems encode a particular kind of computational process a reward prediction error signal similar to those used in areas of artificial intelligence like optimal control this work carried out in collaboration with peter dayan and terry sejnowski focused on prediction as a guiding concept in terms of synaptic learning rules that would underlie learning valuation and choice this work proposed a modification to the then dominant idea of hebbian or correlational learning in particular it was shown that dopamine neurons and homologous octopaminergic neurons in bees display a reward prediction error signal exactly

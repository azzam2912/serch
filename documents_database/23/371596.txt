there are two types of radar jamming mechanical and electronic mechanical jamming entails reflecting enemy radio signals in various ways to provide false or misleading target signals to the radar operator electronic jamming is transmitting additional radio signals towards enemy receivers making it difficult to detect real target signals various countermeasures can sometimes help radar operators maintain target detection despite jamming mechanical jamming is caused by devices which reflect or re reflect radar energy back to the radar to produce false target returns on the operator s scope mechanical jamming devices include chaff corner reflectors and decoys electronic jamming is a form of electronic warfare where jammers radiate interfering signals toward an enemy s radar blocking the receiver with highly concentrated energy signals the two main technique styles are noise techniques and repeater techniques the three types of noise jamming are spot sweep and barrage the burn through range is the distance from the radar at which the jamming is ineffective when a target is within this range the radar receives an adequate target skin return to track it the burn through range is a function of the target rcs radar cross section jamming erp effective radiated power the radars

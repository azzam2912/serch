the active isomer is levcromakalim it acts on atp sensitive potassium channels and so causes membrane hyperpolarization it can be used to treat hypertension as it will relax vascular smooth muscle to lower blood pressure hyperpolarisation of smooth muscle cell membranes pulls their membrane potential away from the threshold so making it more difficult to excite them and thereby cause relaxation reaction of 4 cyanophenol 4 hydroxybenzonitrile with 2 hydroxy 2 methyl 3 butyne under ptc probably proceeds to initial formation of a propargyl carbocation the course of the reaction can be envisaged by assuming that this then attacks the aromatic ring the resulting allylic cation can then capture the adjacent phenol oxygen and thus form the observed product 3 treatment of that product with aqueous nbs leads to the addition of the elements of hypobromous acid and formation of the bromohydrin 4 as a mixture of the trans enantiomers this cyclizes to the epoxide 5 in the presence of sodium hydroxide 5 ring opening of the oxirane with ammonia gives a mixture of the trans amino alcohols 6 these are probably resolved at this stage and the 3 s 4 r enantiomer used in the next stage that isomer

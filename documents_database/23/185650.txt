it is added to help imaging software detect the presence of a banknote in a digital image such software can then block the user from reproducing banknotes to prevent counterfeiting using colour photocopiers according to research from 2004 the eurion constellation is used for colour photocopiers but probably not used in computer software it has been reported that adobe photoshop will not allow editing of an image of a banknote but this is believed to be due to a different unknown digital watermark rather than the eurion constellation the name eurion constellation was coined by security researcher markus kuhn who uncovered the pattern on the in early 2002 while experimenting with a xerox colour photocopier that refused to reproduce banknotes the word is a portmanteau of eur the euro s iso 4217 designation and orion a constellation of similar shape the eurion constellation first described by kuhn consists of a pattern of five small yellow green or orange circles which is repeated across areas of the banknote at different orientations the mere presence of five of these circles on a page is sufficient for some colour photocopiers to refuse processing some banks integrate the constellation tightly with the remaining design

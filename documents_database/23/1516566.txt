they are the type genus of tribe photinini in subfamily lampyrinae this genus contains for example the common eastern firefly p pyralis the state insect of tennessee united states male photinus beetles emit a flashing light pattern to signal for females illegitimate receivers such as female photuris beetles identify these signals and use them to locate the male photinus attract them with deceptive signals and eat them the closest living relative of the rover fireflies is not yet determined with certainty in morphology they resemble their predators the photurinae but they are quite certainly not at all closely related as fireflies go rather the genus ellychnia is either the closest relative of photinus or might even be included in it ellychnia are notable for having lost the ability to produce light again and like the ancestors of all fireflies communicate with pheromones only it might thus be warranted to remove some species from photinus and assign them different genera the genus pyropyga is also a close relative though it is certainly not as close as ellychnia this group makes up the core of the tribe photinini and in fact it seems warranted to restrict the tribe to these genera but

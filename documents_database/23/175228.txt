these properties were chosen by gell mann because they then naturally generalize the pauli matrices for su 2 to su 3 which formed the basis for gell mann s quark model gell mann s generalization further extends to general su n for their connection to the standard basis of lie algebras see the weyl cartan basis in mathematics orthonormality typically implies a norm which has a value of unity 1 gell mann matrices however are normalized to a value of 2 thus the trace of the pairwise product results in the ortho normalization condition where formula 3 is the kronecker delta this is so the embedded pauli matrices corresponding to the three embedded subalgebras of su 2 are conventionally normalized in this three dimensional matrix representation the cartan subalgebra is the set of linear combinations with real coefficients of the two matrices formula 4 and formula 5 which commute with each other there are three independent su 2 subalgebras where the and are linear combinations of formula 4 and formula 5 the su 2 casimirs of these subalgebras mutually commute however any unitary similarity transformation of these subalgebras will yield su 2 subalgebras there is an uncountable number of such

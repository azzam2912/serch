samuel had been mp for whitechapel since 1900 when he took over representation of the seat from his uncle samuel montagu it is not clear why samuel resigned at this time he was aged 59 years but does not seem to have been in ill health the resignation took place in the aftermath of change of prime minister on 7 december 1916 when lloyd george replaced h h asquith as head of a new wartime coalition samuel was the brother of herbert samuel who had been a close associate and supporter of asquith and who had been home secretary in asquith s coalition herbert samuel told lloyd george that he could not serve in the new government and that he did not like the way it had come about herbert samuel did not resign and sat on the opposition front bench with asquith until the end of the war against this background it seems possible that stuart samuel felt it was time leave politics particularly as in july 1917 he was elected president of the board of deputies of british jews and may have been aware his name was being considered for this position the liberals chose alderman james daniel

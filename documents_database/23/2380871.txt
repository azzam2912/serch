fell is a british biochemist and professor of systems biology at oxford brookes university he has published over 190 publications including a textbook on understanding the control of metabolism in 1996 fell did research on the physical biochemistry of yeast pyruvate kinase he obtained a position at oxford polytechnic as a lecturer his early work at oxford polytechnic focused on hemoglobin where he developed more precise techniques for monitoring oxygen saturation and the breakdown of 2 3 bisphosphoglyceric acid by fe iii haemomlogbin at this time he also worked on the first modeling studies related to the functioning of high and low km cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases on the regulation of adenosine 3 5 cyclic monophosphate camp from the early 1980s david fell switched his research to systems biology and was one of the very earliest systems biologists in the uk the other notable systems biologist at time was henrik kacser at the university of edinburgh given that his early work had a significant mathematical and computational component he was ideally positioned to consider a more quantitative approach to studying the properties of cellular networks it was against this background that he turned to the relatively new field called metabolic control

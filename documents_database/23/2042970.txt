the equation is named in honor to alfred g redfield who first applied this equation in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy there is a close connection to the lindblad master equation if a so called secular approximation is performed where only certain resonant interactions with the environment are retained every redfield equation transforms into a master equation of lindblad type redfield equations are trace preserving and correctly produce a thermalized state for asymptotic propagation however in contrast to lindblad equations redfield equations do not guarantee a positive time evolution of the density matrix that is it is possible to get negative populations during the time evolution the redfield equation approaches the correct dynamics for sufficiently weak coupling to the environment the general form of the redfield equation is where formula 2 is the hermitian hamiltonian and the formula 3 are operators that describe the coupling to the environment their explicit form is given in the derivation below consider a quantum system coupled to an environment with a total hamiltonian of formula 4 furthermore we assume that the interaction hamiltonian can be written as formula 5 where the formula 6 act only on the system degrees of freedom the

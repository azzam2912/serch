cardioprotection encompasses several regimens that have shown to preserve function and viability of cardiac muscle cell tissue subjected to ischemic insult or reoxygenation cardioprotection includes strategies that are implemented before an ischemic event preconditioning pc during an ischemic event perconditioning perc and after the event and during reperfusion postconditioning postc these strategies can be further stratified by performing the intervention locally or remotely creating classes of conditioning known as remote ischemic pc ripc remote ischemic postc and remost ischemic perc classical local preconditioning has an early phase with an immediate onset lasting 2 3 hours that protects against myocardial infarction the early phase involves post translational modification of preexisting proteins brought about by the activation of g protein coupled receptors as well as downstream mapk s and pi3 akt these signaling events act on the ros generating mitochondria activate pkc and the reperfusion injury salvage kinase risk pathway preventing mitochondrial permeability transition pore mtp opening the late phase with an onset of 12 24 hours that lasts 3 4 days and protects against both infarction and reversible postischemic contractile dysfunction termed myocardial stunning this phase involves the synthesis of new cardioprotective proteins stimulated by nitric oxide no ros and adenosine

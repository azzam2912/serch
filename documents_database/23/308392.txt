this can be used to confirm the identity of a user before sending sensitive information such as online banking transaction history it applies a hash function to the username and password before sending them over the network in contrast basic access authentication uses the easily reversible base64 encoding instead of hashing making it non secure unless used in conjunction with tls technically digest authentication is an application of md5 cryptographic hashing with usage of nonce values to prevent replay attacks it uses the http protocol digest access authentication was originally specified by rfc 2069 an extension to http digest access authentication rfc 2069 specifies roughly a traditional digest authentication scheme with security maintained by a server generated nonce value the authentication response is formed as follows where ha1 and ha2 are names of string variables ha1 md5 username realm password ha2 md5 method digesturi response md5 ha1 nonce ha2 a md5 hash is a 16 byte value the ha1 and ha2 values used in the computation of the response are the hexadecimal representation in lowercase of the md5 hashes respectively rfc 2069 was later replaced by rfc 2617 http authentication basic and digest access authentication rfc 2617 introduced a number

they include uniprot topdb opm and extopodb there is also a database of domains located conservatively on a certain side of membranes topdom several computational methods were developed with a limited success for predicting transmembrane alpha helices and their topology pioneer methods utilized the fact that membrane spanning regions contain more hydrophobic residues than other parts of the protein however applying different hydrophobic scales altered the prediction results later several statistical methods were developed to improve the topography prediction and a special alignment method was introduced according to the positive inside rule cytosolic loops near the lipid bilayer contain more positively charged amino acids applying this rule resulted in the first topology prediction methods there is also a negative outside rule in transmembrane alpha helices from single pass proteins although negatively charged residues are rarer than positively charged residues in transmembrane segments of proteins as more structures were determined machine learning algorithms appeared supervised learning methods are trained on a set of experimentally determined structures however these methods highly depend on the training set unsupervised learning methods are based on the principle that topology depends on the maximum divergence of the amino acid distributions in different structural parts it was

raceway systems are among the earliest methods used for inland aquaculture a raceway usually consists of rectangular basins or canals constructed of concrete and equipped with an inlet and outlet a continuous water flow through is maintained to provide the required level of water quality which allows animals to be cultured at higher densities within the raceway freshwater species such as trout catfish and tilapia are commonly cultured in raceways raceways are also used for some marine species which need a constant water flow such as juvenile salmon brackish water sea bass and sea bream and marine invertebrates such as abalone the most important factor to consider when selecting a site for a raceway farm is the water supply water sources for raceway aquaculture operations are usually streams springs reservoirs or deep wells trout do best in spring water because it keeps a constant temperature while catfish need a strong flow about 80 litres per second for every 0 4 hectares of raceway a backup water supply should be positioned so if the water supply or pump fails it can flow by gravity into the start of the raceway most raceways are made of reinforced concrete though some earthen raceways

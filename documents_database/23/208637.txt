the theorem gives a formula for the covariance of one random variable with the value of a function of another when the two random variables are jointly normally distributed suppose x is a normally distributed random variable with expectation and variance further suppose g is a function for which the two expectations e g x x and e g x both exist the existence of the expectation of any random variable is equivalent to the finiteness of the expectation of its absolute value then in general suppose x and y are jointly normally distributed then the univariate probability density function for the univariate normal distribution with expectation 0 and variance 1 is and the density for a normal distribution with expectation and variance is then use integration by parts suppose x is in an exponential family that is x has the density suppose this density has support formula 6 where formula 7 could be formula 8 and as formula 9 formula 10 where formula 11 is any differentiable function such that formula 12 or formula 13 if formula 7 finite then the derivation is same as the special case namely integration by parts if we only know formula 16 has

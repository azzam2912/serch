it is named in honor of joseph larmor and the principle of larmor precession that will increase resolution and accuracy it is located at isis neutron and muon source in oxfordshire larmor will be used to make high precision deep images of physical objects since neutrons bear no electrical charge neutron beams can penetrate deeply into materials by examining the few interactions that neutrons do have with atoms they encounter and enhancing the imaging using larmor precession the microscope is predicted to create images with an atom level resolution the microscope will allow for observation of magnetic materials complex liquids and living specimens an example of application of this research is improved electronics and charge storage in lithium ion batteries larmor is a joint project of the delft university of technology the eindhoven university of technology the university of groningen and the science and technology facilities council s isis neutron and muon source it is funded jointly by the participating dutch universities and isis neutron and muon source and the dutch nwo will contribute 2 3 million euros one third of the microscope s time will be reserved for research from the netherlands

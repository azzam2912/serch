1 was premiered in darmstadt in 1947 the premiere was hit by henze s accustomed bad luck the orchestral parts handwritten by the composer himself had become illegible during photocopying in schott s offices and despite the young composer s best efforts to ink in the parts throughout the night only the slow movement was performed the whole symphony was eventually premiered a year later although henze himself conducted the work only after comprehensive revision the revision of the first symphony was part of henze s first great purge on his early work during 1963 the revised sheet music contains a number of rhythmic harmonic and melodic cells from the original version and the slow movement is largely unaltered otherwise everything is in the composer s own words different and better a fourth theme and variation movement has completely disappeared and the work was re scored for chamber orchestra further revision followed in 1991 the first movement is in a contorted sonata form in which the few melodic and rhythmic cells upon which the work is built gradually swell up to an unnerving climax high in the orchestra s range followed by a brief recapitulation the only music to survive

the glyoxylate cycle centers on the conversion of acetyl coa to succinate for the synthesis of carbohydrates in microorganisms the glyoxylate cycle allows cells to utilize simple carbon compounds as a carbon source when complex sources such as glucose are not available the cycle is generally assumed to be absent in animals with the exception of nematodes at the early stages of embryogenesis in recent years however the detection of malate synthase ms and isocitrate lyase icl key enzymes involved in the glyoxylate cycle in some animal tissue has raised questions regarding the evolutionary relationship of enzymes in bacteria and animals and suggests that animals encode alternative enzymes of the cycle that differ in function from known ms and icl in non metazoan species plants as well as some algae and bacteria can use acetate as the carbon source for the production of carbon compounds plants and bacteria employe a modification of the tca cycle called the glyoxylate cycle to produce four carbon dicarboxylic acid from two carbon acetate units the glyoxylate cycle bypasses the two oxidative decarboxylation of the tca cycle and directly convert isocitrate through isocitrate lyase and malate synthase into malate and succinate the glyoxylate cycle utilizes

it uses as its source instead of visible light to automatically inspect features which are typically hidden from view automated x ray inspection is used in a wide range of industries and applications predominantly with two major goals whilst aoi is mainly associated with electronics manufacturing due to widespread use in pcb manufacturing axi has a much wider range of applications it ranges from the quality check of alloy wheels to the detection of bone fragments in processed meat wherever large numbers of very similar items are produced according to a defined standard automatic inspection using advanced image processing and pattern recognition software computer vision has become a useful tool to ensure quality and improve yield in processing and manufacturing similar to an optical inspection an x ray inspection produces images of the object the image is then processed by image processing software that detects the position and size shape of expected features for process optimization or presence absence of unexpected unintended objects or features for anomaly detection instead of visible light it uses x rays typically generated by an x ray tube that pass through the object opposite the x ray emitter is a detector that either converts x

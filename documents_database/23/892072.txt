the hungaria asteroids orbit the sun with a semi major axis longest radius of an ellipse between 1 78 and 2 00 astronomical units au they are the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the solar system the near earth asteroids are much more sparse and derive their name from their largest member 434 hungaria the hungaria group includes the hungaria family a collisional asteroid family which dominates its population the hungaria asteroids typically share the following orbital parameters the 4 1 resonance kirkwood gap at 2 06 au marks the outer boundary of the hungaria family while interactions with mars determine the inner boundary for comparison the majority of asteroids are in core region of the asteroid belt which lies between the 4 1 gap at 2 06 au and the 2 1 gap at 3 27 au most hungarias are e type asteroids which means they have extremely bright enstatite surfaces and albedos typically above 0 30 despite their high albedos none can be seen with binoculars because they are far too small the largest 434 hungaria is only about 11 km in size they are however the smallest asteroids that can regularly be glimpsed with amateur telescopes

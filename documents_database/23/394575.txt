under the posting rule that acceptance takes effect when a letter is posted that is dropped in a post box or handed to a postal worker in plain english the meeting of the minds necessary to contract formation occurs at the exact moment word of acceptance is sent via post by the person accepting it rather than when that acceptance is received by the person who offered the contract the rules of contracts by post postal rules include the following one rationale given for the rule is that the offeror nominates the post office as his or her implied agent and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the offeror the main effect of the posting rule is that the risk of acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the offeror if the offeror is reluctant to accept this risk he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer the rule was established by a series of 19th century cases starting with adams v lindsell 1818 b ald 681 which was later confirmed and expanded in dunlop v higgins 1848

the technique consists in the destruction of the tissue by the insertion therein of optical fibers which convey the light energy causing a complete and not reversible lesions necrosis the therapeutic outcome is the reduction in volume of the nodule and as a result of local symptoms such as compression and reduction or loss of visibility of nodular goiter the goal of therapy is to destroy the lesion without removing the organ thus preserving its normal anatomy once documented the benign nature of the nodule the selection criteria for treatment with the laser concern injuries sufficiently massive to create cosmetic damages or local compressive symptoms and those patients who have contraindications at surgery or anesthesia or will not for aesthetic reasons to undergo surgery the laser ablation of thyroid nodules is performed in day hospital or day surgery the patient is placed under mild sedation the same type of sedation used in an endoscopic examination a local anesthetic is then applied and one or two needles depending on the size of the nodule placed inside the nodule under ultrasound guidance through the lumen of the needles extremely thin optical fibers are placed which are connected to a laser light source

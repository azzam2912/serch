it is mathematically represented as a distribution by a probability density function and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system the density of states is directly related to the dispersion relations of the properties of the system high dos at a specific energy level means that many states are available for occupation generally the density of states of matter is continuous in isolated systems however such as atoms or molecules in the gas phase the density distribution is discrete like a spectral density local variations most often due to distortions of the original system are often called local density of states ldos if the dos of an undisturbed system is zero the ldos can locally be non zero due to the presence of a local potential in quantum mechanical systems waves or wave like particles can occupy modes or states with wavelengths and propagation directions dictated by the system for example in some systems the interatomic spacing and the atomic charge of a material could allow only electrons of certain wavelengths to exist in other systems the crystalline structure of a material could allow waves to propagate in

this method however does not fully reflect the spirit of newman penrose formalism as an alternative one could firstly compute the spin coefficients and then use the np field equations to derive the five weyl np scalars where formula 17 used for formula 18 refers to the np curvature scalar formula 19 which could be calculated directly from the spacetime metric formula 20 szekeres 1965 gave an interpretation of the different weyl scalars at large distances for a general asymptotically flat spacetime containing radiation petrov type i formula 22 formula 23 can be transformed to zero by an appropriate choice of null tetrad thus these can be viewed as gauge quantities a particularly important case is the weyl scalar formula 25 it can be shown to describe outgoing gravitational radiation in an asymptotically flat spacetime as here formula 30 and formula 31 are the plus and cross polarizations of gravitational radiation and the double dots represent double time differentiation there are however certain examples in which the interpretation listed above fails these are exact vacuum solutions of the einstein field equations with cylindrical symmetry for instance a static infinitely long cylinder can produce a gravitational field which has not only

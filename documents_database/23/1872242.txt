breathing gas is supplied at the same pressure as the surrounding water and some of this gas dissolves into the diver s blood and other tissues inert gas continues to be taken up until the gas dissolved in the diver is in a state of equilibrium with the breathing gas in the diver s lungs see saturation diving or the diver moves up in the water column and reduces the ambient pressure of the breathing gas until the inert gases dissolved in the tissues are at a higher concentration than the equilibrium state and start diffusing out again dissolved inert gases such as nitrogen or helium can form bubbles in the blood and tissues of the diver if the partial pressures of the dissolved gases in the diver gets too high when compared to the ambient pressure these bubbles and products of injury caused by the bubbles can cause damage to tissues known as decompression sickness or the bends the immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in the tissues of the diver and the long term goal is to also avoid complications due to sub clinical decompression injury the symptoms of decompression

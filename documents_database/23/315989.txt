these laws describe the inheritance of traits linked to single genes on chromosomes in the nucleus in mendelian inheritance each parent contributes one of two possible alleles for a trait if the genotypes of both parents in a genetic cross are known mendel s laws can be used to determine the distribution of phenotypes expected for the population of offspring there are several situations in which the proportions of phenotypes observed in the progeny do not match the predicted values non mendelian inheritance plays a role in several disease processes in cases of intermediate inheritance due to incomplete dominance the principle of dominance discovered by mendel does not apply nevertheless the principle of uniformity works as all offspring in the f generation have the same genotype and same phenotype mendel s principle of segregation of genes applies too as in the f generation homozygous individuals with the phenotypes of the p generation appear intermediate inheritance was first examined by carl correns in mirabilis jalapa he used for further genetic experiments antirrhinum majus also shows intermediate inheritance of the pigmentation of the blossoms in cases of co dominance the genetic traits of both different alleles of the same gene locus are

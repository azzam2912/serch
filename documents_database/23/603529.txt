the relationships discovered between this application and a central metadata registry is then stored in the metadata registry itself on average developers are spending only 5 of their time writing new code 20 modifying the legacy code and up to 60 understanding the existing code thus adu saves a great deal of time and expense for organizations that are involved in the change control and impact analysis of complex computer systems impact analysis allows managers to know that if specific structures are changed or removed altogether what the impact of those changes might be to enterprise wide systems this process has been largely used in the preparation of y2k changes and validations in software application discovery and understanding is part of the process enabling development teams to learn and improve themselves by providing information on the context and current state of the application the process of gaining application understanding is greatly accelerated when the extracted metadata is displayed using interactive diagrams when a developer can browse the metadata and drill down into relevant details on demand then application understanding is achieved in a way that is natural to the developer significant reductions in the effort and time required to perform

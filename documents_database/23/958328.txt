the nahm equations are formally analogous to the algebraic equations in the adhm construction of instantons where finite order matrices are replaced by differential operators deep study of the nahm equations was carried out by nigel hitchin and simon donaldson conceptually the equations arise in the process of infinite dimensional hyperk hler reduction among their many applications we can mention hitchin s construction of monopoles where this approach is critical for establishing nonsingularity of monopole solutions donaldson s description of the moduli space of monopoles and the existence of hyperk hler structure on coadjoint orbits of complex semisimple lie groups proved by peter kronheimer olivier biquard and a g kovalev let t z t z t z be three matrix valued meromorphic functions of a complex variable z the nahm equations are a system of matrix differential equations together with certain analyticity properties reality conditions and boundary conditions the three equations can be written concisely using the levi civita symbol in the form more generally instead of considering n by n matrices one can consider nahm s equations with values in a lie algebra g the variable z is restricted to the open interval 0 2 and the following conditions

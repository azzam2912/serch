the finite water content method is an ordinary differential equation alternative to the richards partial differential equation the richards equation is difficult to approximate in general because it does not have a closed form analytical solution except in a few cases the finite water content method is perhaps the first generic replacement for the numerical solution of the richards equation the finite water content solution has several advantages over the richards equation solution first as an ordinary differential equation it is explicit guaranteed to converge and computationally inexpensive to solve second using a finite volume solution methodology it is guaranteed to conserve mass the finite water content method readily simulates sharp wetting fronts something that the richards solution struggles with the main limiting assumption required to use the finite water content method is that the soil be homogeneous in layers the finite water content vadose zone flux method is derived from the same starting point as the derivation of richards equation however the derivation employs a hodograph transformation to produce an advection solution that does not include soil water diffusivity wherein formula 1 becomes the dependent variable and formula 2 becomes an independent variable where this equation was converted into

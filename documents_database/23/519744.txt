the basic model was developed in the laboratory for image and video engineering live at the university of texas at austin and further developed jointly with the laboratory for computational vision lcv at new york university further variants of the model have been developed in the image and visual computing laboratory at university of waterloo and have been commercially marketed ssim is used for measuring the similarity between two images the ssim index is a full reference metric in other words the measurement or prediction of image quality is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion free image as reference ssim is designed to improve on traditional methods such as peak signal to noise ratio psnr and mean squared error mse the predecessor of ssim was called universal quality index uqi or wang bovik index and was developed by zhou wang and alan bovik in 2001 this evolved through their collaboration with hamid sheikh and eero simoncelli into the current version of ssim which was published in april 2004 in the ieee transactions on image processing in addition to defining the ssim quality index the paper provides a general context for developing and evaluating perceptual quality measures including connections to

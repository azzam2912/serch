78 in c minor hoboken 1 78 is a symphony by joseph haydn completed in 1782 in 1782 almost a decade before haydn composed the first of his famous london symphonies he composed a trio of symphonies 76 77 and 78 for a trip to london which fell through haydn wrote the following to his paris music publisher boyer on july 15 1783 last year i composed 3 beautiful magnificent and by no means over lengthy symphonies scored for 2 violins viola basso 2 horns 2 oboes 1 flute and 1 bassoon but they are all very easy and without too much concertante for the english gentlemen and i intended to bring them over myself and produce them there but a certain circumstance hindered that plan and so i am willing to hand over these 3 symphonies it is not known how much haydn knew of the tastes of english audiences but the three symphonies do possess a polish and style typical of london composers such as johann christian bach and carl friedrich abel as noted in the letter the winds have very few measures where they do not support the strings they are used primarily to add color the

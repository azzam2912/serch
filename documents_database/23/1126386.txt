it is also known as 4 phosphopantetheinyl transferase after the group it transfers all acps enzymes known so far are evolutionally related to each other in a single superfamily of proteins it transfers a 4 phosphopantetheine 4 pp moiety from coenzyme a coa to an invariant serine in an acyl carrier protein acp a small protein responsible for acyl group activation in fatty acid biosynthesis this post translational modification renders holo acp capable of acyl group activation via thioesterification of the cysteamine thiol of 4 pp this superfamily consists of two subtypes the trimeric acps type such as e coli acps and the monomeric sfp pcp synthesizing type such as b subtilis sfp structures from both families are now known the active site accommodates a magnesium ion the most highly conserved regions of the protein are involved in binding the magnesium ion the systematic name of this enzyme class is coa 4 phosphopantetheine apo acyl carrier protein 4 pantetheinephosphotransferase other names in common use disregarding the synthetase synthase spelling difference include acyl carrier protein holoprotein synthetase holo acp synthetase coenzyme a fatty acid synthetase apoenzyme 4 phosphopantetheine acyl carrier protein synthetase acps pptase acyl carrier protein synthase p pant transferase

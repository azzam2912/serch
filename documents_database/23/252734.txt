the classic starling equation has in recent years been revised the starling principle of fluid exchange is key to understanding how plasma fluid solvent within the bloodstream intravascular fluid moves to the space outside the bloodstream extravascular space starling can be credited with identifying that the absorption of isotonic salt solutions from the extravascular space by the blood vessels is determined by this osmotic pressure of the serum proteins 1896 transendothelial fluid exchange occurs predominantly in the capillaries and is a process of plasma ultrafiltration across a semi permeable membrane it is now appreciated that the ultrafilter is the endothelial glycocalyx layer whose interpolymer spaces function as a system of small pores radius circa 5 nm where the endothelial glycocalyx overlies an inter endothelial cell cleft the plasma ultrafiltrate may pass to the interstitial space some continuous capillaries may feature fenestrations that provide an additional subglycocalyx pathway for solvent and small solutes discontinuous capillaries as found in sinusoidal tissues of bone marrow liver and spleen have little or no filter function the rate at which fluid is filtered across vascular endothelium transendothelial filtration is determined by the sum of two outward forces capillary pressure formula 1 and interstitial protein osmotic

analyse alg brique is a seminal textbook in infinitesimal calculus published by augustin louis cauchy in 1821 the article follows the translation by bradley and sandifer in describing its contents on page 1 of the introduction cauchy writes in speaking of the continuity of functions i could not dispense with a treatment of the principal properties of infinitely small quantities properties which serve as the foundation of the infinitesimal calculus the translators comment in a footnote it is interesting that cauchy does not also mention limits here cauchy continues as for the methods i have sought to give them all the rigor which one demands from geometry so that one need never rely on arguments drawn from the generality of algebra on page 6 cauchy first discusses variable quantities and then introduces the limit notion in the following terms when the values successively attributed to a particular variable indefinitely approach a fixed value in such a way as to end up by differing from it by as little as we wish this fixed value is called the limit of all the other values on page 7 cauchy defines an infinitesimal as follows when the successive numerical values of such a

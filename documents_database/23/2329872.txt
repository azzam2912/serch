he has a phd in biochemistry and biophysics from harvard university 1990 during his phd work he investigated axon guidance and target recognition in the developing mouse with walter gilbert subsequently he initiated the studies on zebrafish cardiac development as a helen hay whitney postdoctoral fellow with mark fishman at the massachusetts general hospital boston together with the many students and postdocs in his laboratory stainier helped pioneer the use of the zebrafish model to study a wide range of questions pertaining to vertebrate organ development and function and has published extensively his forward genetic analyses of heart development revealed the unexpected role of several signaling pathways including sphingosine 1 phosphate signaling and the discovery of the long elusive sphingosine 1 phosphate transporter additional genetic screens led to the elucidation of transcriptional networks regulating endoderm formation and endothelial cell specification as well as extracellular signals regulating liver induction he pushed the frontiers of in vivo microscopy to reveal new insights into cardiac valve formation and cardiac trabeculation and used cellular approaches to gain a detailed understanding of these processes stainier developed and used single cell analyses to provide the first in vivo demonstration of the hemangioblast a formerly hypothetical cell

though designed for game development its flexibility has led to it being used for a variety of purposes and to its evolution into the language pike lpc syntax places it in the family of c like languages with c and c its strongest influences almost everything in lpc is an object however lpc does not precisely use the concept of a class mudos has something called a class but it is really a struct instead lpc objects are blueprint objects and clones of blueprint objects in a prototype based programming model one can treat a blueprint object much as a class in other object oriented languages each object has variables attributes and functions methods the variables store the object s state the functions are executable routines that can be called in the object an object is uniquely defined by the name of the file in which it comes from plus if a clone a numeric identifier in a typical implementation a clone of the file codice 1 which is the third clone created in the current run session will be codice 2 the blueprint object corresponding to codice 1 is simply codice 4 in a mud game common objects include

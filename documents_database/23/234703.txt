as the hyperfocal distance is the focus distance giving the maximum depth of field it is the most desirable distance to set the focus of a fixed focus camera the hyperfocal distance is entirely dependent upon what level of sharpness is considered to be acceptable the hyperfocal distance has a property called consecutive depths of field where a lens focused at an object whose distance is at the hyperfocal distance h will hold a depth of field from h 2 to infinity if the lens is focused to h 2 the depth of field will extend from h 3 to h if the lens is then focused to h 3 the depth of field will extend from h 4 to h 2 etc thomas sutton and george dawson first wrote about hyperfocal distance or focal range in 1867 louis derr in 1906 may have been the first to derive a formula for hyperfocal distance rudolf kingslake wrote in 1951 about the two methods of measuring hyperfocal distance there are two common methods of defining and measuring hyperfocal distance leading to values that differ only slightly the distinction between the two meanings is rarely made since they have almost identical values
